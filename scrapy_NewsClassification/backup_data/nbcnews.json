now our public health is dictated by the whims fears and sometimes fantasies of Trump He appears outraged not by a potential pandemic but by the fact that concerns around the coronavirus have driven massive stock selloffs Of course this makes perfect sense Trump doesnt often bother himself with problems that do not personally affect him That’s why he is slow to express sympathy for tragedies he does not connect to and why his main concern consistently lies with public perception We hired an experienced amoral bully to run the government That Donald Trump is not handling a potential crisis

on the legislation arguing that House members should have to go on the record like the Senate did Massies attempt to force a rollcall vote however was likely to be denied because House leaders believe there will be a quorum present paving the way to pass the measure by voice vote He later acknowledged on Twitter that his plan to force a vote would likely be blocked It’s pretty clear now with enough members here to pass the bill that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind and no recorded vote  Earlier Friday Massie tweeted that many people including manufacturing workers health care professionals pilots grocery clerks cooks delivery drivers and others still had to go to work in the midst of the outbreak Is it too much to ask that the House do its job just like the Senate did he tweeted referring to the Senates rollcall vote on the legislation Wednesday night Massie said he was not delaying the bill which he railed against This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing he wrote 1111 2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about 1333300 per person That’s much more than the 1200 per person check authorized by this bill Democratic and Republican leaders suspected Massie would try to force a recorded vote They advised House members to come back to Washington late Thursday because they believed the   would not pass by the planned Friday voice vote and could be delayed if a quorum of at least 216 members werent in attendance Members then raced to get back to Washington — in the middle of the   — to make it for the possible rollcall vote Massie was in the chamber Friday morning just after the House came into session at 9 am ET He was one of about 50 members who were present at the time and they were spaced out around the room Shortly after the House began debate on the bill President Donald Trump slammed Massie in a pair of tweets saying that he only wants publicity and that delaying the bill would be dangerous  costly Looks like a third rate Grandstander named   a Congressman from unfortunately a truly GREAT State Kentucky wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress He just wants the publicity He can’t stop it only delay which is both dangerous  costly Workers  small businesses need money now in order to survive Virus wasn’t their fault It is “HELL” dealing with the Dems had to give up some stupid things in order to get the “big picture” done 90 GREAT WIN BACK HOUSE but throw Massie out of Republican Party White House officials were monitoring the floor closely on Friday and working with congressional

long as it takes for 216 members to arrive in Washington You might have one grandstander Trump said at his news briefing Thursday It will pass It will just take a little longer He has said he would

he opposes a voice vote on the bill the report said Im having a really hard time with this Because theyre saying well its hard to travel yadda yadda yadda Massie said Well last night 96 out of 100 senators voted All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote Members have been scattered across the country as flights have been canceled and millions of people have sheltered in their homes amid the pandemic Public health officials have said in the last 48 hours that anyone traveling from New York should quarantine for 14 days — which could affect many members of Congress There are also two members who have tested positive for the virus and over a dozen more who are selfquarantining after possible exposure Members are encouraged to follow the guidance of their local and state health officials however if they are able and willing to be in Washington DC by 1000 am tomorrow members are encouraged to do so with caution Hoyers notice to members said The notice also included guidance that if a vote does take place members will be called alphabetically in groups of 30 Massie who has threatened to vote no on the package told local and national media Thursday that he was driving back to Washington for the vote Earlier Thursday Massie tweeted the section of the Constitution that defines a quorum — a rule he could use to derail the bill if enough of his colleagues arent present and voting The House needs a quorum — half its membership — present to pass a bill if any single member demands one If no one asks for a quorum it is assumed a quorum exists That is what would allow the House to act without a recorded vote by voice or by unanimous consent There are five vacancies in the 435member House so 216 votes constitutes a majority Kasie Hunt the host of MSNBCs Way Too Early is

{"7139": "The clamor for a swift return to normal has started to pick up in recent days — particularly in the rightwing media ecosystem Thats come as President Donald Trump has suggested that he could quickly move to change his administrations guidelines in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak in hope of returning some people to work in less than three weeks and ending the stock market slide No example drew more attention than an   that Texas Lt Gov Dan Patrick a Republican gave Monday night on Fox News in which he suggested that some elderly Americans — the group most at risk of death from COVID19 — should be willing to sacrifice their lives so the economy can gain steam No one reached out to me and said As a senior citizen are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for its children and grandchildren And if that is the exchange Im all in said Patrick 70 But Scott Gottlieb Trumps former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration   that while there is a strong and understandable desire to return to better times and a functioning economy it should not be lost on anyone that theres no such thing as a functioning economy and society so long as COVID19 continues to spread uncontrolled in our biggest cities Gottlieb and other experts have warned that too quick a return would cause much more economic distress than continuing course for a while longer So long as COVID19 spreads uncontrolled older people will die in historic numbers middle aged folks doomed to prolonged ICU stays to fight for their lives hospitals will be overwhelmed and most Americans terrified to leave homes eat out take the subway or go to the park he said adding theres no easy return and we must accept a sober truth Speaking at a news conference Tuesday New York Gov Andrew Cuomo pushed back against Patricks sentiment saying My mother is not expendable And your mother is not expendable he continued And our brothers and sisters are not expendable Were not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable Were not going to put a dollar figure on human life The core of Patricks argument to get back to normal is that the response to the outbreak is more damaging than the pandemic itself It has been echoed by a number of others including rightwing commentator Jesse Kelly who   that hed happily die if the choice was either death or plunging the country I love into a Great Depression Laura Ingraham one of Fox News most prominent primetime personalities   that health officials should not be the determinative voices in policy making now or at the end of 15 days Elsewhere Sen Ron Johnson RWis   the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that even a mortality rate as high as 34 percent from the illness does not justify shutting down major parts of the economy And Lloyd Blankfein the former top executive at Goldman Sachs   that those with a lower risk of death should return to work within a very few weeks On   Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr a top evangelical ally of Trumps welcomed more than 1000 students back to his university in Lynchburg Virginia from spring break even as classes move online Trumps frustrations with the economic downturn first spilled into public Sunday night when he tweeted in all capital letters that WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF By Tuesday Trump was delivering his clearest time frame telling a Fox News town hall that hed love to have the country open by Easter which is a less than three weeks away The push comes as White House aides feel they are in a nowin situation If the administration pushes to ease restrictions it could be blamed for increasing deaths as the virus spreads But they see farreaching consequences for having Americans stuck at home for weeks or months Beyond the economic impact administration officials warned about the effect on children who have bad home lives or the health effects from the physical and emotional stress on people who have lost their jobs a White House official said Already   say they worry that the White House went too far in allowing public health experts to set policy and that their actions need not have been so draconian The number of total confirmed cases in the US is right about 50000   Whats less clear is whether Trump has the ability to quickly alter the countrys course aside from using the bully pulpit Governors and local officials have implemented shutdowns although many are following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In many places school systems are shuttered for the rest of the school year while restaurants bars gyms and other large gathering places have been closed Meanwhile private industry has instituted its own instructions during the pandemic Fun fact since Donald Trump didnt actually close anything down he cant actually open anything up Ron Klain who served as the Ebola czar in the administration of President Barack Obama   Speaking to reporters Tuesday Larry Kudlow Trumps top economic adviser cautioned that the president is looking to reopen swaths of the economy in places that have not been hit as hard by the virus adding that the administration is not abandoning health professionals advice but there is a clamor to try to reopen the economy Its difficult to know exactly which places are safer from the virus as it has a lengthy incubation period while widespread testing still has yet to fully take off The push runs counter to the messaging from health experts   some in Trumps administration On Friday the nations top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci said he cannot see that all of a sudden next week or two weeks from now its going to be over I dont think theres a chance of that he said adding that any change is at least several weeks out Meanwhile Sen Lindsey Graham RSC one of Trumps closest congressional allies   Monday Try running an economy with major hospitals overflowing doctors and nurses forced to stop treating some because they cant help all and every moment of gutwrenching medical chaos being played out in our living rooms on TV on social media and shown all around the world There is no functioning economy unless we control the virus he added For his part Cuomo did suggest that a strategy in which some elements of the shutdown

major surges in weekoverweek positive tests for   The data include significant increases in some rural counties including those where outbreaks in prisons are now being reported for the first time Dr Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a Senate Committee on Tuesday that   of the disease if states and localities ease restrictions too soon At the same time   and reported here first the task force is reporting internally that it has not yet achieved its own goals for reopening In those documents prepared late last week and marked “privileged and confidential” federal officials wrote that while they have “completed” guidelines for states to reopen they still haven’t developed a vaccine or treatments ensured “adequate access to laboratory diagnostics” or fully enabled frontline workers to “obtain and preserve critical medical supplies” The president continues to tell the public a much different story about the state of the coronavirus fight than the one told by data and public health experts inside his administration He has declared victory time and again since he first marked Easter weekend in midApril as his target for easing restrictions and he has repeatedly had to back off of statements made in his selfdescribed role as cheerleader for the nation But now as Election Day draws nearer and the ranks of the unemployed grow by several million each week he appears to be committed to ignoring the risks Trump is betting most Americans will accept more deaths from the coronavirus in the interest of restarting commercial and social activity — or at least that they wont blame him for trying Just a few weeks ago he confidently predicted that the death toll from COVID19 might not surpass 50000 people in the United States It currently stands at more than 82000 And this week he sounded the notes of a conqueror despite the continued spread of the disease and more fatalities “We have met the moment and we have prevailed” the president said at a Rose Garden news conference Monday He later said in response to a question from NBC’s Geoff Bennett that he was talking only about the testing that his own task force has concluded remains a work in progress He also said that the threat of the disease is receding all over the country despite the worrisome spikes in new hot spots and the hard fact that the number of cases is guaranteed to continue rising as more Americans get tested White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that she had spoken to Dr Deborah Birx the White Houses coronavirus response coordinator and was told that these are isolated outbreaks  where there are specific instances in lets say a meatprocessing facility or a prison which can be isolated So I would

the fact that outbreaks at prisons and factories mean that people are contracting the virus many of the surges are not attributable to a cluster in a single building or complex The same type of spikes that Trump describes as embers are the ones Fauci warned could set off a resurgence Moreover even in some places where growth in the number of cases is at least partially a function of expanded

on a watchlist by the task force because it recorded a 64 percent weekoverweek increase in coronavirus cases in the days leading up to May 7 County Judge KP George Fort Bend’s top executive told NBC News that he expected to see a bump after investing heavily in providing free testing for residents “I want to test more people” he said “I believe soon we might be able to find the peak” But he said that Texas Gov Greg Abbott’s decision to force a phasedin reopening of the state on May 1 a move applauded by Trump came two weeks too early and left too little flexibility for local officials to keep stayathome rules in place “I want the county to open because businesses are hurting” he said but “science data and experts — these are the three things that we will rely on” Trump’s administration is teeming with health experts and stocked with data showing where the virus is spreading Alarm bells are being rung But the president has chosen to drown them out with the sound of his own proclamations He has said economic hardship is its own public health risk Whether thats his sincere belief or the justification he seeks for pursuing an economic recovery vital to his reelection or both his office requires him to make tough judgments about the best interests of the American public In this case hes going against the evidence and the advice of experts within his own administration Jonathan Allen

{"5584": "WASHINGTON — The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has grown increasingly concerned that President Donald Trump pushed by a new member of his coronavirus task force is sharing incorrect information about the pandemic with the public Dr Robert Redfield who leads the CDC suggested in a conversation with a colleague Friday that Dr Scott Atlas is arming Trump with misleading data about a   including questioning the   whether young people are susceptible to the virus and the potential benefits of   Everything he says is false Redfield said during a phone call made in public on a commercial airline and overheard by NBC News Redfield acknowledged after the flight from Atlanta to Washington that he was speaking about Atlas a neuroradiologist with no background in infectious diseases or public health Atlas was brought on to the White House task force in August Redfield testified before Congress this month that he suspects that a face covering could protect him from Covid19 better than any future vaccine Most public health officials share the view that masks are essential to stopping the spread of the virus Still Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on how useful wearing them may be If every one of us did it this pandemic would be over in eight to 12 weeks Redfield said before offering a stark warning that contradicted the presidents assertion that the country is rounding the corner on the pandemic Were nowhere near the end Redfield said In an email a CDC spokesman said NBC News is reporting one side of a private phone conversation by CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield that was overheard on a plane from Atlanta Hartsfield airport Dr Redfield was having a private discussion regarding a number of points he has made publicly about Covid19 Before he joined the task force Atlas was a frequent guest on Fox News where he pushed to reopen the country and espoused views that more closely align with Trumps opinions during the health crisis Since his addition to the task force Atlas has become the medical expert who   with the president and his profile has been elevated in recent weeks by his appearing in the White House briefing room when Trump speaks with reporters Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci who attended neardaily briefings with the president alongside Redfield in the spring have at times voiced their disagreements with Atlas as   climbing by 22 percent in the last two weeks according to data reviewed by NBC News Two dozen states reported higher numbers than during the previous sevenday period   of the virus in the United States with 7 million infected so far There is a concern among Redfield and others that Atlas continually briefs the president and misrepresents what other health experts have said in sworn testimony according to a member of the task force Asked to respond to Redfields comments Atlas said in a statement Everything I have said is directly from the data and the science It echoes what is said by many of the top medical scientists in the world including those at Stanford Harvard and Oxford A White House official responded by saying the president consults with many experts both inside and outside of the federal government who sometimes disagree with one another He then makes policy decisions based on all of the information to save lives and safely reopen the country the official said adding that everyone including the president recommends wearing a mask when you cannot social distance Fauci and Birx declined to comment When the president said last week that the virus affects virtually nobody who is young members of the task force including Redfield rejected the statement as false Its not true Redfield said in an interview We know that the infection is very common We know the highestrisk group right now is 18 to 25 Redfield pointed out however that the president is correct in noting that mortality rates are quite low in that age group But when certain other people suggest that this virus doesnt affect children Redfield added theyre not correct About a quarter of new infections right now are in people 18 to 25 years old according to a CDC spokesman and while they likely will not die from the coronavirus they can easily infect older or ailing populations who are more vulnerable And when Redfield testified last week that 90 percent of Americans remain susceptible to the coronavirus Atlas directly contradicted him and claimed that he had misstated that fact under oath Atlas argued that Redfield was using old data even though Redfield cited information from July and August when answering lawmakers questions on Capitol Hill The CDC has yet to release that information publicly but it says it will do so soon The virus is likely going to continue to infect people for the foreseeable future until a vaccine is administered widely in the US starting with the first doses being available in 2020 and more widely available in the second and third quarter of 2021 an agency spokesman said When Atlas was pressed about why Americans should listen to him instead of health experts sworn testimony he told NBC News Peter Alexander Youre supposed to believe the science and Im telling you the science It was not the first time that the president or his advisers have dismissed testimony by Redfield After Redfield predicted that most Americans wont receive a vaccine until the middle of 2021 Trump accused him of being mistaken and confused Redfield maintains that there is no distance between him and the president but he stands by his assertion that most of the public wont receive the vaccine until the second or third quarter of next year because vulnerable populations will be prioritized and it will take significant time to roll out shots to everyone Atlas has made his feelings about the public health experts leading the coronavirus response widely known occasionally accusing them of withholding all the knowledge that we have The data is out there and we dont all have to be paralyzed with fear Atlas said Thursday on Fox News We have to do very very diligent protection of the people who are vulnerable and those are usually older people with other comorbidities and we need to open because we know the harms of not opening Atlas has repeatedly advocated for schools to open fully and he has urged the president to push the same stance And while he has privately embraced the option of adopting a herd immunity strategy according to a member of the task force Atlas told reporters in a briefing last week that he has never advocated a herd immunity strategy Trump himself presented it as a possibility in a town hall gathering this month misstating it as   He suggested it after having falsely claimed that the virus would go away without the vaccine and he cited Atlas as someone who agrees with him that the US is turning the page on the pandemic despite Faucis rejection of the rosy messaging Well I mean but a lot of people do agree with me Trump said You look at Scott Atlas you look at some of the other doctors that are highly — from Stanford Look at some of the other doctors

effectiveness And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute One minute And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning said Trump Because you see it gets on the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs So itd be interesting to check that So that youre going to have to use medical doctors but it sounds — it sounds interesting to me he added Disinfectants like bleach are   doctors say This notion of injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body is irresponsible and its dangerous said Dr Vin Gupta a

suspended parliament indefinitely due to the outbreak Four doctors in Iran who are familiar with how authorities are handling the outbreak including two who work at hospitals where infected patients have been treated told an NBC News reporter in New York that the total number of those infected is likely substantially higher than the number released by health authorities Dr Mike Ryan executive director of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program told reporters Thursday that the virus came unseen and undetected into Iran so the extent of infection may be broader than what we may

the most deaths from the new form of   There have been 2747 deaths in China out of a total of at least 78497 confirmed cases But Irans reported mortality rate — now just nine under percent — surpasses

Two members of Iran’s parliament have contracted the virus as well as the deputy health minister who was seen wiping his brow and looking feverish at a press conference a day before he announced he had tested positive While the government has imposed some restrictions on holy sites and called off some Friday prayer services President Rouhani has said there are no plans to quarantine entire cities hit by the virus Amid a shortage of surgical masks and hand sanitizer in shops public health experts say Iran could become the hub of a major outbreak across the Middle East especially given its porous borders with unstable countries at war or in turmoil Iranian officials reported the first case of virus in the religious city of Qom last week and   has spread to at least seven other provinces Other countries in the region including Iraq Kuwait Oman and Afghanistan reported their first cases this week and said the patients had recently visited Iran In an echo of public reaction in China critics of the Iranian regime in and outside the country are questioning whether officials in Tehran have given the public a full and accurate picture of the outbreak But Iranian officials have rejected any suggestion that they are playing down the epidemic The head of Medical Science University in Qom Mohammad Reza Ghadir said on state television that the Health Ministry had banned releasing figures on the outbreak in the city Asked how many people had been placed in quarantine Ghadir said The Health Ministry has told us not to announce any new statistics Ghadir also said that most of the tests have to be done in Tehran and Tehran announces it His comments suggested that diagnostic tests were mainly being conducted in the capital Outside medical experts said reporting on the total number of cases of infection in Iran was possibly lagging behind reporting on deaths That could be because Iranian authorities are missing less severe cases across the country because of how they are testing and diagnosing patients because of how information is shared or because of flawed medical equipment This appears to be a reporting issue said Yanzhong Huang director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University and a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations Reporting on the cases of infections may have fallen behind the reporting on the deaths Its unclear whether Iran has the ability to find out how many people have been infected which would require venturing out to towns and villages to conduct tests and not simply relying on who goes to large hospitals with severe symptoms said   a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center That means going to the neighborhood and knocking on doors and really aggressively trying to find cases Schaffner said in an interview I dont know if they have that capacity Many countries do not and they dont have that tradition in their public health systems This would be a very new thing for them to do Another possibility is that the patients are from an elderly more vulnerable part of the population Schaffner said If the virus was introduced to a population that was older and as a consequence has a bunch of underlying illnesses that could explain a high fatality rate Schaffner said A less likely explanation is that Irans hospitals had fallen short and patients were not getting the necessary medical care Schaffner said But he doubted that was the case because Iran has a relatively advanced health care system Dr John Torres NBC News medical correspondent said there is no evidence of a change in the genetic profile of the virus so the explanation for the higher mortality rate likely has to do with how the Iranians are tracking cases of infection The virus has not mutated elsewhere Torres said State media said Tuesday that a member of Parliament   and the countrys deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi who lead a task force battling the virus had tested positive The news came a day after Harirchi appeared at a news conference looking   reaching for tissues to wipe his brow He wore no mask as the ministry

This means 1000 additional beds staffed by federal personnel This will provide muchneeded relief to our over stressed hospital systems The ship was initially brought in to admit nonCOVID19 cases in

volume of bodies New York officials he added wanted to avoid   where the military was forced to collect bodies from churches and even off the streets But the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner responded that it is not considering temporary burials in New York City parks and Levine walked back his comments tweeting that if the death rate drops enough it will not be necessary De Blasio also

said that the ability to waive certain laws and regulations would allow for easier admission to nursing homes and end limits on the length of hospital stays and the number of beds available He announced that 14 million new tests for the coronavirus would be available next week and that 5 million would be available within the next month — although he added that I doubt well need that quantity He also said there were plans to allow drivethru virus tests In an unusual and lengthy news conference a parade of business leaders took turns speaking after Trump — before the president and other federal officials made additional key announcements related to the administration’s coronavirus response Trump shook hands with several of those business leaders as he introduced them at the lectern — a breach of best practices recommended by public health experts across the United States After the corporate leaders spoke Trump and other officials finally announced additional measures to confront the pandemic which included the waiving of interest on federal student loans and the purchase of “large quantities” of oil for the US strategic oil reserve Officials also said they would be

{"7628": "President Donald Trump announced federal guidelines to reopen the US on Thursday that put the onus on governors of making decisions about their states economies Trump called the recommendations the next front in our war which is called opening up America again He said that the strategy is based on hard verifiable data and that benchmarks must be met at each phase Now that we have passed the peak in new cases we are starting our life again We are starting rejuvenation of our economy again in a safe and structured and a very responsible fashion Trump said We are not opening all at once but one careful step at a time Under the first phase of the threephase plan restaurants movie theaters and large sporting venues would be appropriate to reopen under certain conditions while schools day care centers and bars would not The plan released Thursday afternoon is designed to mitigate the risk of resurgence of the pandemic and to protect the most vulnerable according to the guidelines It is implementable on a statewide or countybycounty basis at the discretion of each states governor — a stark contradiction from the presidents earlier assertion that he had   to direct governors how and when to reopen The guidelines do not suggest any reopening dates and Trump acknowledged that it would be a gradual process To begin implementing the guidelines states must first meet a gating criterion that includes a downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14day period or a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14day period flat or increasing volume of tests as well as hospital preparedness If that criterion is met states could then enter Phase One according to the guidelines Under Phase One protocols large venues like restaurants movie theaters sporting venues and places of worship would be allowed to reopen if they operate under strict physical distancing protocols according to the guidelines Gyms would be also be permitted to reopen if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols the plan says Bars however should remain closed In addition elective surgery would be allowed to resume as clinically appropriate on an outpatient basis at certain facilities Schools and youth activities like day care and camp that are currently closed should remain closed and visits to senior living facilities and hospitals should remain prohibited Those who do interact with residents and patients must adhere to strict protocols regarding hygiene the plan says Under Phase One all vulnerable individuals should continue to shelter in place and members of households with vulnerable residents should be aware that by returning to work or other environments where distancing is not practical they could carry the virus back home It also calls for the employers to allow employees to telework The plan also emphasizes that all people should continue to practice social distancing when in public and that they should continue to minimize nonessential travel Phase Two the guidelines state applies to states and regions with no evidence of a rebound that satisfy the gating criteria a second time Under this phase schools and activities like day care centers and camps could reopen and nonessential travel could resume Visits to senior care facilities and hospitals however would remain prohibited The large venues that were allowed to reopen in Phase One like restaurants movie theaters and sporting venues could remain open and would be allowed to ease their physical distancing protocols to a moderate level Bars could begin operating with diminished standingroom occupancy while gyms could remain open with strict distancing sanitation protocols according to the plan Phase Three would then kick in for states and regions with no evidence of a rebound that satisfy the gating criteria a third time At that point vulnerable individuals could resume public interactions but should practice social distancing according to the guidelines Lowrisk populations should still consider minimizing time spent in crowded environments Only in Phase Three could work sites resume normal staffing protocols without restrictions and visits to senior care facilities and hospitals could resume People who interacted with residents and patients would still have to remain diligent regarding hygiene Under Phase Three guidelines large venues could operate under limited social distancing protocols gyms could remain open with standard sanitation protocols and bars could operate with increased standing room occupancy The White House views Trumps announcement as guidance under which governors will have to make decisions whats right for their individual states a White House official told NBC News Some states may be able to move to the next phase before May 1 according to the official In some states governors would be able to open up some counties before others The guidelines the official said represent the consensus of the medical professionals including Dr Deborah Birx the White House   response coordinator Dr Anthony Fauci the governments top infectious disease expert and Dr Stephen Hahn the head of the Food and Drug Administration Hours before the plan was released Trump told governors that they would have the power to make their own decisions Youre going to call your own shots Trump said during a videoconference with governors Thursday afternoon in the Situation Room according to two people listening to the call Earlier this week he said the president of the United States calls the shots when it comes to reopening A coordinated   that have shuttered businesses across the country would in effect reopen parts of the economy  more than   In addition   as the job market in every sector of the economy continues to be devastated To preserve the health of our citizens we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy Over the long haul you cannot do one without the other Trump said  that the White House was circulating a draft plan to reopen the economy that would advise areas with low numbers of coronavirus infections to begin pulling back on social distancing measures after May 1 with harderhit areas possibly having to wait another month or longer Regions that can be the first to renew economic activity should have limited transmission ample public health and health system capacity and they should be prepared to monitor the situation closely for a resurgence of infections according to the 10page document which was circulated to a new task force and shared with NBC News The plan stopped short of specifying metrics for how communities would know whether or when they fall into that category Trumps announcement came as   have begun discussing plans to ease some of the restrictions that have been imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic States   the Northeast and along the Pacific Coast launched separate regional pacts Monday to coordinate plans around how to open up and get their economies going again while seven Midwestern states announced a similar agreement Thursday However governors and lawmakers on Capitol Hill as well as   have stressed the need for greater testing capacity to truly begin easing social distancing restrictions   that the White House is exploring ways to increase testing so localities could feasibly meet the presidents May 1 timeline “Testing is the key to opening our country to resume our lives House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif said in a statement on Thursday night The

of Health and Human Services to waive certain laws and regulations to ensure the virus can be contained and patients treated To unleash the full power of the federal government … I am officially declaring a national emergency Trump said Two very big words he added Trump said the action would open up access to up to 50 billion for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top federal officials and corporate executives from companies such as Walmart Trump said that the ability to waive certain laws and regulations would allow for easier admission to nursing homes and end limits on the length of hospital stays and the number of beds available He announced that 14 million new tests for the coronavirus would be available next week and that 5 million would be available within the next month — although he added that I doubt well need that quantity He also said there were plans to allow drivethru virus tests In an unusual and lengthy news conference a parade of business leaders took turns speaking after Trump — before the president and other federal officials made additional key announcements related to the administration’s coronavirus response Trump shook hands with several of those business leaders as he introduced them at the lectern — a breach of best practices recommended by public health experts across the United States After the corporate leaders spoke Trump and other officials finally announced additional measures to confront the pandemic which included the waiving of interest on federal student loans and the purchase of “large quantities” of oil for the US strategic oil reserve Officials also said they would be

that banks received their 31 pages of guidance from the Treasury Department on how to lend the money — and some havent even decided whether they can participate on the opening day In a strongly worded statement one of the nations biggest lenders said the muchtouted relief program for small business owners wasnt ready for prime time Financial institutions like ours are still awaiting guidance from the SBA and the US Treasury Chase Bank said in an email to business customers referring to the Small Business Administration As a result Chase will most likely not be able to start accepting applications on Friday April 3rd as we had hoped The bank said it would post electronic updates on its website and Twitter account and send emails when it was ready to start participating We are working hard so we can be ready as soon as humanly possible  a senior Chase executive told NBC News but with several regulatory hurdles it was unlikely the bank could start processing applications by Friday morning At a White House news briefing Thursday afternoon Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin maintained that the program is ready to go and said he wasnt aware of the complaints We just put up the federal register with the new guidelines for lenders” he said “Ive been assured that the banks will start lending tomorrow It is a very large priority we want to get this money quickly into your hands Mnuchin added He said the Treasury had spoken with the top banking leaders and received input and has now simplified the application form The application period for the   administered by the SBA starts at midnight Thursday The program promises relief for an estimated 30 million small businesses providing eight weeks of cash flow and 100 percent federally guaranteed loans that could be completely forgiven if they use them to keep their workers employed The money can also be used to pay rent utilities and mortgage interest with no collateral required However as recently as Wednesday night Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan the point person for the nations top bankers for the measure had a private phone call with Mnuchin to go through the plan line by line senior banking

Weekly initial jobless claims  eclipsing all previous numbers Small businesses say they needed the money yesterday and are hoping for quick relief — and millions are expected to apply on the first day However checks might not start going out for a week or more Its utter chaos said James Brower a partner at Marks Paneth a New York Citybased accounting firm Business owners are clamoring for this money They want to pay their people They want to pay their landlord Theres this lifeline thats been dropped but they keep pulling the rope back up to the helicopter Were now hearing from bankers that they may not want to get into the program because the law doesnt have a whole lot of specifics in it yet the phone lines are jammed with business owners begging for loan applications Brower said Banks dont know what the rules are and theyre afraid if they lend money to someone they shouldnt have theyll be required to pay it back to the government The rules ask for small businesses to upload their payroll statements but with no uniform way to report them some of the statements will have to be eyeballed individually Then there are concerns about verifying the information and the potential for fraud or just simple mistakes Lenders are gunshy after the industry was held liable for billions of dollars in fines and lawsuits following the rollout of relief efforts after the 2008 financial crisis On Thursday Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden drew attention to the potential administrative issues of the coronavirus relief package He pressed the administration to get loans out quickly and not just to the wellconnected or a few splashy examples Nick Simpson head of public affairs for the Consumer Bankers Association said If youre already an SBAapproved lender then you have the rails to run the requirements Since its run through that system its not like something has to be created The potential for things to slow down would be in the way the verification and underlying requirements are on the bank Simpson said If its a very easy process with minimal underwriting more like a credit card than a traditional loan then things will operate a lot smoother The longer the

{"6760": "WASHINGTON — Senate campaign committees and top super PACs are making their biggest investments on the airwaves in North Carolina Arizona and Iowa three states where Republican incumbents are looking to fend off Democratic attempts to win back the Senate in November  Now that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has released the breakdown of its initial round of television and digital investments all four top committees in the battle for the Senate have sketched out early buy information — the DSCC the National Republican Senatorial Committee Senate Leadership Fund the Republican super PAC and Senate Majority PAC the Democratic super PAC  North Carolina is far and away the top target of that initial investment — 664 million between the four groups 373 million from the blue team and 291 from the red team There Republican Sen Thom Tillis will face off against Democrat Cal Cunningham with the Democrat leading by 5 points in   just inside the margin of error  That comes as North Carolina has seen the most television and radio spending already so far — 206 million according to Advertising Analytics with Maine a close second at 205 million  Then comes Arizona and Iowa in the second tier of spending with 37 million and 356 million respectively between the four groups The Democratic effort has the spending edge of these investments in both states — Democrats have booked 221 million in Arizona and 204 million in Iowa with Republicans booking 149 million in Arizona and 152 million in Iowa  Arizona Republican Sen Martha McSally is expected to face off against Democrat Mark Kelly in that state while a handful of Democrats are facing off to win the right to run against Republican Sen Joni Ernst with Democrat Theresa Greenfield the bestfunded of those options  Then theres Maine and Colorado bunched closely together — two states where those Republican groups are booking more initial advertising Republicans are booking 123 million of the 219 million in initial reservations in Maine and 119 million of the 171 million in Colorado  In those states Democrats are looking to dethrone Maine Republican Sen Susan Collins and Colorado Republican Sen Cory Gardner  In Montana home to the clash between GOP Sen Steve Daines and Democratic Gov Steve Bullock Democrats are booking 52 million compared to Republicans 28 million  Then there are two states where only those Republican groups have decided to make initial investments in — SLF is putting 108 million into Kentucky defending Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell while the NRSC is spending 27 million in Michigan where it hopes to knock off Democratic Sen Gary Peters  The initial spending plans are just one piece of the puzzle — these groups are all expected to dump more money into the map there are other outside groups either already running ads or that will in the coming months and the candidates themselves will hit the airwaves depending on how much money they are able to raise  But now that the four big groups have released their initial plans we can see where they believe their early money may go the furthest  WASHINGTON — Since starting nightly online broadcasts one month ago

wear them because they prevent infection Similarly the Czech Republic which had a significantly lower rate of infection compared to fellow European countries such as Spain and Italy  advising all other countries to implement populationwide use of face masks even homemade ones Adam Vojtěch the Czech health minister stated Today we see this was one of the most important decisions we have made and if it helped here it can help anywhere Why were top US public health officials telling Americans otherwise I did read the surgeon generals tweet and you have to understand the context Kim told Asian Boss I think the point was to prevent people from hoarding masks because medical professionals need them more  In other words because masks are in short supply in the US medical professionals should be prioritized Americas lack of protective equipment is indeed a crisis But that was not what the public health officials were telling Americans not really You had to read between the lines to get to that conclusion Much more directly   that maskwearing was not effective for healthy people As the pandemic raged on this advice increasingly made less and less sense The   recommending public maskwearing for fear that it would create a false sense of confidence to dispense with social distancing Almost all experts agree that social distancing is vital to flattening the curve Yet Americans could simply have been advised that maskwearing would be a complement to not a replacement for social distancing Keep in mind that the White House at the advice of its public health experts first instructed Americans to practice social distancing on March 16 In other words Americans were not practicing social distancing and were   being discouraged from wearing masks during those weeks before

administration stands in sharp relief to   by the experts on the ground involved in the response And so the president who was criticized early in the crisis for downplaying the risk posed by the virus while health officials were sounding the alarm now faces claims that he is overplaying the available assistance While Trump has given overly optimistic timelines and overstated his accomplishments

security drawing criticism from public health experts and political opponents Memo to Donald Trump take a day off from the briefing room where you hype cures that arent proven promise websites that dont exist and talk about tests that arent being given  and let CDCgov talk Ron Klain a longtime adviser to Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden who led the Obama administrations response to the Ebola outbreak said Thursday in a tweet The president has gone further than government experts on multiple fronts including available treatment On Thursday — during a news conference which Trump had described a day earlier as being held to announce very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus — he said a decadesold malaria drug had been approved to treat COVID19 and could be a game changer Moments later the FDA said the drug was still going through the approval process to determine if it was safe and effective for coronavirus patients When Trump was pressed by NBCs Peter Alexander on Friday about whether this claim was giving Americans false hope he testily defended his positive spin I feel good about it thats all just a feeling smart guy Trump said I feel good about it and you are going to see soon enough Trumps recent assurances about the scope of medical supplies on the way for health care workers also hasn’t matched what has been available on the ground As hospitals have   to get the protective supplies they need Trump has repeatedly expressed confidence the US will have the supplies needed Over the past week Trump has said the US had “massive numbers of ventilators” and plenty of protective masks for health care workers while assuring that more supplies were on the way “The masks are being made by the millions” Trump said on March 14 “Millions and millions We have plenty now but were ordering for the millions Were ordering worstcase scenario” But a few days later Trump had to call on the military to rush out protective supplies as hospitals said they had to start reusing masks making their own and asking the public for donations When Trump was asked at a press briefing Thursday about the gap between his own claims and what health care providers say they are experiencing he denied overhyping “I’m hearing very good things on the ground he said To make sure the US has the supplies it needs Trump said Wednesday he was turning to the Defense Production Act to get the private sector to ramp up production similar to the effort in WWII when factories adapted their capabilities to make military equipment But Trump declined to specify on Friday what steps if any he had taken under the act to require companies to ramp up production of needed supplies For patients confused about whether they need testing and how to get it Trump announced last week that Google was developing a coronavirus testing website that was going to be “very quickly done unlike websites of the past” Vice President Mike Pence said Americans would be able to use the website “very soon” to find out if they needed testing and where to go to get it But the website being developed by Google sister company Verily has ended up being much more limited in scope than what the White House promised Verily did launch a   this week similar to the one Trump described but said in a statement to NBC News that the site is in the “early stages of development” and only being tested in two California counties While Pence clarified the day after the White House announced the site that it would just be for the San Francisco Bay Area “with the goal of expanding to other locations” Trump denied there was any miscommunication saying the head of Google called to apologize without elaborating on what that apology was allegedly for and accused the media of putting out false information without specifying what the inaccuracies might be To address growing concerns by hospitals that they would soon run out of beds for patients Trump said at a Wednesday press conference that the Navy was sending a medical ship to New York and another to the West Coast to help treat patients Trump said the ships “are in tiptop shape They soon will be” On timing he said “they can be launched over the next week or so depending on need” Defense Secretary Mark Esper gave a less optimistic timeline later that day During an interview on CNN he said the ship to be sent to New York which is currently undergoing maintenance wouldn’t be ready for “a couple weeks plus” and the one on the West Coast “should be ready in a week and half two weeks definitely before the end of the month” He said the ships still needed to be staffed with medical personnel and only then moved to their locations Esper also clarified that the ships built to deal with wartime trauma wouldn’t be used to treat those infected with the coronavirus but rather to take care of other patients to free up hospital operating rooms And as concern has mounted in the general public over exposure and diagnosis Trump has repeatedly overplayed the availability of testing He said on March 6 that anyone who needed a test was able to get one reiterating that claim when asked about it at a press conference last week On March 9 Vice President Mike Pence said that 1 million tests had been distributed and 4 million more were expected to be sent by the end of the week predicting on March 13 that 15000 to 20000 tests would be performed a day The testing availability has been changing rapidly and more labs are coming online daily but roughly eight weeks after the first confirmed cases

million it said in a press release Monday  North Carolina is the beneficiary of the most early ad booking with the Democratic SMP announcing plans to reserve 256 million there and the Republican SLF planning to book 218 million There Republican Sen Thom Tillis will take on Democratic former state Sen Cal Cunningham An   taken in late February of that race showed Cunningham up 5 points on Tillis

Republican Sen Joni Ernst is defending her seat against whichever Democrat wins the primary currently scheduled for June 2 Ernsts favorability rating fell to 47 percent among Iowa adults in the   but 41 percent of likely voters said theyd definitely vote to reelect Ernst compared to 31 percent who said theyd definitely vote for someone else  Close behind in that earlyspending figure is Arizona

that ultimately he and his two housemates all tested positive But hes now fully recovered and asymptomatic New Yorkers and Americans at large are stepping up in a tremendous unified way We know how

Drug Administration and existing antigen tests for other viruses have their faults But experts say the tools could become part of the broader solution Antigen tests are designed to detect viral proteins — which in the case of the coronavirus would come from the spikes that coat the outside surface of the virus — that trigger an immune response in the body For now the main way to screen for COVID19 the disease caused by the coronavirus is through whats known as polymerase chain reaction or PCR testing The test looks for the coronavirus genetic material in a sample but because the viral RNA is so tiny it needs to be amplified or copied millions of times in a lab to get a result Theyre much more complicated to do but PCR tests are the most sensitive said Dr Pedro Piedra a professor of molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston Although it is accurate PCR testing is both resource and time intensive Many of the current tests require multiple steps manual pipetting of reaction components and very accurate pipetting skills Dr MarieLouise Landry director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven Connecticut said in an email There are large instruments that can automate much of the PCR process and have a higher throughput but these may still only do 300400 samples in an eighthour shift That makes it difficult to significantly ramp up PCR testing throughout the country There will never be the ability on a PCR test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school but there might be with the antigen test   during a coronavirus task force briefing April 17 Both antigen and PCR tests require nasal swabs but antigen testing is simpler and could be conducted by primary care physicians Patients would also get results in less than an hour Antigen testing exists for the flu in which doctors can administer rapid influenza diagnostic tests that deliver results in 15 to 30 minutes It is hoped that any breakthroughs in antigen testing for the coronavirus would have similar outcomes You dont need specialized personnel to run the test its costeffective and you get rapid results — thats what youre looking for here said Dr Aron Lukacher chair of the department of microbiology and immunology at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey Pennsylvania But antigen testing is not as sensitive as PCR testing which means there is a greater chance that antigen tests could deliver false negative results In other words a patient could be infected but an antigen test is just not sensitive enough to detect it For some antigen tests the rate of false negatives can be 5 percent to 10 percent according to Lukacher which makes them less reliable PCR testing although not perfect is thought to be more finely tuned because amplifying the virus genetic material also means smaller amounts of the virus can be detected Antigen tests can also be challenging to develop because scientists need to be intimately familiar with the virus structure and biology to know what immune response will be triggered by these foreign substances PCR tests have the advantage that you can test for many pathogens not just one virus Piedra said Antigen tests have to be built for specific viruses Health officials are hopeful that significant strides can be made in designing new diagnostic tools Earlier this month the federal governments Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority awarded more than 710000 to a Pennsylvaniabased company called OraSure Technologies to develop a rapid coronavirus test using saliva samples Other researchers at E25Bio a Massachusettsbased biotech company are working on a coronavirus antigen test that could deliver results in 15 minutes Still Lukacher said rapid antigen tests are unlikely to be a silver bullet for cities looking to restart their economies and emerge from lockdowns Rather any breakthroughs in antigen testing will likely have to be scaled up in tandem with PCR testing for health officials to determine how much the virus has spread in a community The bottom line is we would want both — rapid screening and the ability to test by PCR Lukacher said All of these things have to be done in conjunction with one another Denise Chow is a reporter for NBC News Science focused on

governments but lawmakers were still hopeful a deal would be reached soon In a call with House Democrats early Monday evening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was hopeful an agreement would be reached on an interim deal two sources on the call told NBC News What remains outstanding in the negotiations one source on the call said is if Republicans will take the language Democrats want regarding hospitals and testing – and to make sure the flexibility is there for states to use money from the earlier relief bill CARES 1 Negotiators said earlier Monday that they were nearing an agreement but a disagreement unfolded over the state and local funding — a nonstarter for Republicans two sources told NBC News A number of governors including Andrew Cuomo of New York have been calling on Congress for weeks to send their states financial assistance Administration officials told lawmakers during a call Sunday that the funding would not be included in the legislation Pelosi told the caucus that the White House is not willing to negotiate on the state and local money until the next bill so she turned her focus to use resources from the earlier legislation for states that have acute needs the sources said If a deal is reached Monday night the Senate will vote Tuesday afternoon the sources said The House would likely vote on the legislation Wednesday morning Some progressive lawmakers including Rep Alexandria OcasioCortez DNY voiced opposition to the developing legislation Monday As the person whos representing the most impacted district in the country my constituents are upset My constituents were upset about the first package she told reporters In my district and in New York City and in our community weve had more deaths than 911 Multiple times of 911 have happened in the time since Congress has recessed So Im not here with the luxury of time If it matches up with what has been reported I will not support this bill she added Some of the final negotiations are also over how to administer funding for hospitals and testing There are questions for example over whether testing will be geared toward the public or private sectors The deal is expected to include 310 billion more for the federal governments new Paycheck Protection Program which was created in the last major relief package to help small businesses survive and   The interim measure was also expected to provide 75 billion more for hospitals and according to three sources familiar with the talks 25 billion for testing The current legislation also leaves out funding for food stamps — a Democratic priority that Republicans argue can be negotiated in the next relief bill expected in the coming weeks At the White House coronavirus task force briefing Sunday evening President Donald Trump said that a resolution of negotiations looked promising and that there could be a nice answer tomorrow The president confirmed that hospitals including those in rural areas would be part of the agreement Last week the   was depleted and Democrats and Republicans were deadlocked over how to pour money back into it Democrats demanded that part of the funding be set aside for minority and underserved communities The measure was expected to include 250 billion for the regular   and a 60 billion carveout for small businesses owned by minorities women and those in rural areas An additional 60 billion for a separate smallbusiness program for disasters — known as the Disaster Relief Loan Program — was expected to be wrapped in Most of the money for the disaster funding 50 billion would be in the form of loans and the other 10 billion would be in the form of grants multiple sources familiar with negotiations said To vote on the legislation once an agreement is reached the Senate could pass it by unanimous consent which could happen only if no senator objects The House on the other hand is almost certainly unable to pass it by unanimous consent House

{"5037": "BARCELONA Spain — The dead piled up around the globe tell a tale When   coffin makers couldn’t keep up with the demand In Italy the bodies were stacked unceremoniously in the back of military vehicles and hauled away As the  death toll in the United States mounts experts can only estimate as to how high it will go  as governments accused each other of lying about their coronavirus casualties So while the  stands at more than 126000 on Wednesday  according to Johns Hopkins University that number represents a mere estimate Only countries with extensive testing can confirm their mortalities and even in those with the necessary medical technologies the simple act of counting the dead reflects the chaos that COVID19 has wrought Accurate counts are critical to understanding where to place scarce resources such as ventilators and personal protective equipment They are also one of the few ways to understand how and where the disease will likely intensify “We don’t test we don’t know who counts” said Gerardo Chowell professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the Georgia State University School of Public Health in Atlanta “The number of confirmed deaths in Korea means something different than the number of confirmed deaths in Mexico South Korea quickly ramped up testing rates and they have tested all if not all of the suspected cases In Mexico that has not been the case” NBC News takes a look at how some of the world’s leading health authorities have tried and often failed to count their dead from the pandemic On Feb 28 a Washington state man in his 50s became the   in the US As of April 14 the nation’s death toll stood at more than 24000 making it the highest in the world And epidemiologists in the US suspect that due to the general lack of testing capacity and varying standards from state to state this number may be an underestimate Earlier this year the percentage of deaths due to pneumonia nationwide was declining By midMarch pneumoniarelated deaths were above the threshold that would be considered alarming Normally a decline in flu deaths would coincide with a decline in pneumonia fatalities In Washington state Florida and New York pneumonia deaths increased even as deaths due to the flu were declining according to data collected by the  “In the United States testing started very slowly which allowed the virus to spread silently through the population” Chowell said “And then obviously when people start to die they are classified as a death from a respiratory disease or flulike symptoms who may also have hypertension or diabetes Those deaths will likely not get counted when in reality it was the virus that triggered their death” The CDC came to pretty much the same conclusion “Deaths due to COVID19 may be misclassified as pneumonia deaths in the absence of positive test results and pneumonia may appear on death certificates as a comorbid condition Thus increases in pneumonia deaths may be an indicator of excess COVID19related mortality” As with some countries in Europe the US is working to establish a more realtime understanding of deaths that may be coronavirus related but have been attributed to other causes Normally this kind of analysis — called excess mortality surveys — takes a year to develop There are varying theories as to the identity of the first person to bring the coronavirus into   A team of researchers in  believes the person to be an asymptomatic carrier who likely brought the disease in from Munich Italy’s first officially diagnosed patient was a 38yearold married man who had never been to China where the coronavirus was first identified The man identified by the Italian National Institute of Health only as Mattia was athletic and resided in the small town of Codogno south of Milan according to Flavia Riccardo an epidemiologist at the institute Local doctors thought he had contracted the flu Feb 21 His pregnant wife became infected And when he went to the hospital the coronavirus was passed on to doctors nurses and other patients From there the virus spread widely Italy has reported more than 21000 fatalities Some claim that it may be one of the few countries in the world whose actual coronavirus deaths may be fewer than officially stated Others think just the opposite And this is typical of the confusion that ensues when a curtain of death descends over a period of just a few weeks On the one hand the Italian health system counts not only people who died directly from the coronavirus but also those who died of other causes although they may have contracted the virus Dr Walter Ricciardi the scientific adviser to Italy’s health minister said last week “Only 12 percent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus” he said in a press conference On the other hand it is unclear the extent to which people who have died in their homes have been counted The procedures mandate postmortem testing In the chaos that ensued when the outbreak hit however it was not at all clear that procedures were being followed according to Marina Davoli who directs the department of epidemiology for the Italian region of Lazio The regional epidemiology department of Lazio has long been monitoring excess mortality in Italy for the national ministry of health They have found that between Feb 1 and March 21 excess fatalities in Milan increased by 36 percent and in Brescia by 88 percent over the previous year Most of these deaths are attributable to the coronavirus and the virus hit after a previously mild winter “We have a pool of old people who were killed immediately” Davoli says At the same time epidemiologists are concerned that a portion of the excess deaths may be due to a general fear of going to the hospital in the midst of the pandemic Spain’s official tally the thirdhighest after the United States and Italy is   And yet these figures likely do not reflect the true extent of how badly  When the pandemic first arrived Spain did not take into account those who have died in their homes or in nursing facilities Soldiers working for emergency response units tasked to disinfect the country’s nursing homes encountered horrible scenes of the dead “completely abandoned or even dead in their beds” Defense Minister Margarita Robles said recently More bodies were found in subsequent days including 25 in a nursing home in the posh district of Chamartin in Madrid The lack of molecular testing kits means the overall number of dead may be underreported In some parts of the country the number of dead was 70 percent higher than previous years even taking into account coronavirus mortalities according to research conducted by the Carlos III Health Institute published in the  The institute conducted an excess mortality survey which in the absence of blanket testing gives a more accurate indication of coronavirus fatalities At the outset of the crisis France also undercounted its dead Until recently authorities only counted coronavirus deaths from the 600 public hospitals in the country Those who died at home or in the nation’s 7500 facilities for the elderly were not included in the official tally of coronavirus deaths In the wake of multiple deaths in French nursing homes  announced that deaths at these centers would now be tallied On April 6 French Health Ministry announced that 1000 health establishments were submitting data on mortalities Like Spain France is moving quickly to fortify its system of reporting excess mortalities While there is a twoweek delay in getting this information it does give French authorities the capacity to provide a good estimate of deaths from all causes during the epidemic A quick turnaround means that French authorities will be able to get a better idea of possible coronavirus deaths that may not have been otherwise registered Like Spain and France the UK appears to have had a problem counting the number of deaths in nursing homes On Tuesday the Office for National Statistics said 5979 people in England had died by April 3 with COVID19 — 15 percent more than numbers published by the health service Public Health England Medical Director Yvonne Doyle has said that while daily figures record only hospital deaths the ministry is working to include statistics from nursing homes into their official tally We just need to be absolutely clear that the cause of death that is attributed is correct and that is what takes time on the death certificate to get right she said in a news conference But we would like to have much more rapid data preferably on a daily basis and that is what we are working towards Even before the new figures the official British death toll was the fifthhighest globally and a senior scientific adviser to the government has said the country risks becoming the worsthit in Europe China where the outbreak began in 2019 has reported 83351 cases of infection Long lines and stacks of ash urns greeting family members of the dead at funeral homes in   where the outbreak began showed the toll the pandemic has wrought even as the government has eased the lockdown in some areas while tightening it in others China’s National Health Commission updates its death toll each day The numbers of confirmed and suspected cases and deaths should be filed by the medical and health organizations those that are authorized to receive coronavirus patients directly into the commission’s internal system When some of those hospitals cannot log into the system they can report to the local disease control center which will then file the information This means they count the deaths reported by authorized hospitals The manner of counting the dead has become a political question as the US and China trade accusations during the pandemic President Donald Trump who has in the past   said on April 1 that China’s numbers appear to be suppressed — a claim Beijing denies “Their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side and I’m being nice when I say that” he said at a daily coronavirus briefing at the White House He did not however cite specific evidence The Chinese government has said that Trump’s accusations are an effort to deflect attention from Washington’s mishandling of the crisis USChina relations have suffered under Trump who started a trade war with the world’s secondlargest economy His administration alleges that Beijing initially tried to cover up the coronavirus outbreak — a claim Chinese officials deny Meanwhile some Chinese officials have fueled bogus claims that the

{"7273": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump seems to be experiencing a different coronavirus crisis than the rest of the country And his personal vision of it could spell a significant danger to his reelection campaign For many people including most of the rest of the government theres   as it continues to spread into more states  are tearing chunks out of retirement accounts The prospect of entire industries shutting down from travel and tourism to live entertainment threatens to send the economy into a tailspin And thats to say nothing of the actual health peril that has public officials warning this could be just the beginning of a global catastrophe But according to Trump everythings still perfect from the way he handled the outbreak to availability of test kits Many Americans recall that he played down the threat last month — the risk to the American people remains very low he said as he questioned whether it would spread — and mocked politicians who implored him to take it more seriously He used the word hoax at a rally in South Carolina later explaining that he meant criticism of his response was a hoax So at the exact time when administration officials statelevel officials and the public   Trump told everyone there was nothing to worry about He tried to sell Americans on the idea that they didnt need to protect themselves because he had it all under control Now the risk is bigger both because of the slowfooted response and because it appears that investors health officials and the general public dont feel they can trust what the president is saying All of that makes the coronavirus and the potential for greater illness and economic damage it could bring a singular threat to Trumps reelection Even if minimal damage is done many voters will recall that Trump either didnt see the possible risk or pretended it wasnt that bad Even on Monday he continued to minimize the problem implying it was far less dangerous than seasonal influenza So last year 37000 Americans died from the common Flu It averages between 27000 and 70000 per year he tweeted Monday Nothing is shut down life  the economy go on At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths Think about that His political opponents have taken notice Lives depend on the wisdom and judgment of the president Pete Buttigieg who recently exited the race for the Democratic presidential nomination said Monday on MSNBCs Morning Joe And there are certain things that no one else in the government can do to coordinate the response to manage the issue to convincingly reassure the American people he said And we don’t have that and that is incredibly costly Its costly medically its costly economically The   is as obvious in the deeds of Trumps Republican allies as it is in the words of Democrats What hes saying doesnt comport with reality Several GOP lawmakers have selfquarantined after possibly making contact with someone with the virus — and following that   A senior congressional Democratic aide told NBCs Sahil Kapur that Trumps use of the bully pulpit is causing deep concern in Congress Members and staff are very concerned about the White House response and how bad this can get across the country the aide said There’s a feeling that the country could look a lot different in two weeks time in terms of people’s ability to move freely go to work and school  There was a thinking developing that the country had made it this far without a genuine crisis that Trump had to deal with and may get through an election with the status quo holding That’s not true anymore Indeed this crisis is unique in the degree of difficulty for Trump because he didnt create it he cant distract from it and hes already tried to make it go away with his patented nothingtoseehere news conference in which he generally declares victory and moves on — this time to no avail If it gets better not worse it will be a miracle for public health and for his presidency Trump is sticking to the tactic presidents typically use to keep investors calm during periods of economic instability — sometimes resulting in stabilization sometimes not The old line is the fundamentals of the economy are sound Variations of it have been used by administrations and presidential campaigns from those of Herbert Hoover to John McCain in times of distress Trump however is dealing with an underlying public health crisis and underplaying that threat could have major consequences for both the safety of the American public and the relatively strong economy he has centered his reelection campaign around The Fake News Media and their partner the Democrat Party is doing everything within its semiconsiderable power it used to be greater to inflame the CoronaVirus situation Trump tweeted earlier Monday Far beyond what the facts would warrant Surgeon General The risk is low to the average American A tanking economy would put Trump in greater jeopardy of losing his job Just a few weeks ago before he was acquitted of House impeachment charges by the Senate he delivered a relatively wellreviewed State of the Union address and watched the Democrats Iowa caucuses fall apart Trump was at a political apex But now if the economy turns and more of the public loses faith in his leadership over his handling of the coronavirus he could find himself facing an emboldened frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for the first time since his inauguration Former Vice President Joe Bidens commanding victory in the Super Tuesday primaries last week made him the

seamless partnership that was forged from the very beginning between our administration and your administration here at the state level Pence said Thursday while visiting Washington state On Friday Trump chastised Pence for saying nice things about Inslee who briefly ran for president last year and called the governor a snake which did not appear to be intended as a compliment And as Trump

{"2975": "President Donald Trump in daily news conferences at the White House and in interviews has made a number of false or misleading claims about the   and US efforts to combat it including some that put him at odds with health experts and that prompted clarifications from his own top health and science officials NBC News is factchecking some of his statements made or repeated at various points during the ongoing global crisis and updating this article Asked about pandemic memos circulated by top trade adviser Peter Navarro warning of the effects the coronavirus could have Trump argued that he acted at the same time shuttering the US to China and eventually Europe “That was about the same time that I closed it down” he said on April 8 referring to travel restrictions he put in place to slow the spread of coronavirus We closed it down to all of China we closed it down to all of Europe those were big moves Trumps claims here are half true Navarro’s warnings were reportedly circulated in late January and Trump’s travel ban on China was ordered January 31st — so hes right on the timing But Trumps other statement that he shut down all travel from China and Europe is false He closed the border to most foreigners travel from China to the US — exempting US citizens and some others — but he did not shut down the borders completely On March 11 Trump ordered the border closed to foreigners coming to the US from 26 European states but not all of Europe “Take a look at the swine flu It was a disaster 17000 people died the other administration…it’s like they didn’t even know it was here” Trump claimed during an April 6 news conference Swine flu killed an estimated  during the Obama administration The first case was detected on April 15 2009 Within two weeks according to  the federal government had declared a public health emergency begun work on a vaccine started releasing PPE from the federal stockpile and purchasing antivirals and had rolled out a test “Something we did very well is when we stopped the inflow from China at a very early level that was a good thing to do a great thing to do We would have had thousands and thousands of more deaths And we also stopped the inflow from Europe at a very early level” Trump said on March 29 “We had never done anything like it where we closed our borders to a country like that” The US barred entry by foreigners who had travelled in China in the past two weeks with some exceptions starting on February 2 But its hard to know the impact of one decision — amid a rolling nationwide response — on mortality One expert Dr Irwin Redlener the director of the Columbia University National Center for Disaster Preparedness and a public health analyst for NBC News and MSNBC called the travel bans a “mixed bag in terms of effectiveness Stopping travel from China was coupled with   on the potential severity of the threat   Trump said the US has very little problem and through February Trump was comparing the coronavirus to a flu “There was value in closing the border to Chinese nationals coming to the US in the early weeks of this situation Closing the borders to Europeans later It was too late to make much difference It’s a mixed bag” he told NBC News We inherited a broken test Trump said on March 30 on Fox News Later in the day he complained that his administration wasnt getting enough credit for overcoming what he claimed was a broken testing system in order to get a coronavirus test up and running “You should be saying congratulations to the men and women who have done this job who have inherited a broken testing system and who have made it great” he said during the March 30 Rose Garden news conference Trumps claims come amid broad criticism that the US was slow to begin testing its residents for coronavirus hurting early efforts to contain the outbreak But it’s impossible for Trump to have inherited a broken testing system for COVID19 The novel coronavirus did not exist until late last year when researchers believe it was transmitted from an animal to a human for the first time And theres little evidence that the actions past administrations hamstrung the Trump administration here particularly since no administration had faced a pandemic of this nature Redlener said the president’s claim was “nonsense” “There’s nothing that he inherited that could have hamstrung them” said Redlener adding that virus test development is pretty commonplace “Even if there was the World Health Organization and Germany and other places offered us testing equipment and materials which we decided not to take he said There is however evidence that the Trump administration made early missteps The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   and then as a limited supply came online ran the lab work through just a   That prolonged wait times for a diagnosis while the virus spread further lab directors and public health experts   and the federal government did not issue new rules speeding the approval process for commercial research and academic labs until Feb 29 Testing capacity has since expanded significantly On April 1 Trump told reporters that the United States had banned dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people and we did so early far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else The US implemented a restriction on foreign travelers who had been in China in the past two weeks at 5 pm Feb 2 Italy had already   and North Korea had banned  During a news conference March 30 Trump said We have done more tests by far than any country in the world by far in response to a question about the United States lagging behind in testing residents per capita It is technically true that the US has run more tests for the disease caused by the virus than any other country but this claim one the president makes frequently requires more context The US is not testing the same share of its population as other countries a key measure On March 31 the White House said there had been more than 11 million tests thats 1 in 297 people who are getting tested South Korea for instance   But South Korea has a population of 51 million people which means they’re testing a much larger share of the population — 1 in every 124 people Trump argued Monday that the US is a large country and there are areas that wouldnt need rampedup testing But even in the hardesthit areas — like New York City — many cannot get tested The president has promoted   as an “approved” treatment for COVID19 the disease caused by the coronavirus The hydroxychloroquine and the Zpack I think as a combination probably its looking very very good Trump said during a news briefing March 23 He called the pair of medicines a drug that got approved in recordsetting time Theres some early evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — decadesold drugs used to prevent malaria and treat rheumatic diseases — might help patients fight off the virus particularly when paired with the antibiotic azithromycin commonly known as a ZPack But its not an approved treatment for the coronavirus according to the Food and Drug Administration or even a fully vetted option according to one of Trumps top scientists The information that youre referring to specifically is anecdotal It was not done in a controlled clinical trial So you really cant make any definitive statement about it the nations leading infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci said during the same news conference Dr Stephen Hahn commissioner of the FDA also said in March that the agency wants a large pragmatic clinical trial to see whether the drug actually benefits patients A nationwide trial to determine whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent the disease in exposed persons is underway   Trump said of hydroxychloroquine on March 31 I think some medical workers are doing that using it maybe or getting it prescribed perhaps as — for another use There is a theory going around that in our country and some other countries people are taking that — that work in the hospitals that work with the patients — because there is some evidence And again its going to have to be proven Its very early he added Here Trump is continuing to promote an unapproved treatment by amplifying anecdotal reports of a practice medical authorities have acknowledged is indeed happening But those same authorities have issued warnings against the practice in large part because the treatment is not approved by the FDA The American Medical Association the American Pharmacists Association and the American Society of HealthSystem Pharmacists released a  acknowledging that some physicians and others are prophylactically prescribing medications currently identified as potential treatments for COVID19 We strongly oppose these actions the statement said We caution hospitals health systems and individual practitioners that no medication has been FDAapproved for use in COVID19 patients These early anecdotal success stories and the presidents public promotion of the drugs as an effective weapon against the disease have led to hoarding and shortages of the drug leaving people with lupus and other rheumatoid diseases During multiple news conferences Trump has questioned the rate at which a hospital in New York is using personal protective equipment PPE suggesting that theft is why the unnamed facility needs 300000 masks a week At one point he claimed a distributor told him that a New York hospitals mask purchases were far too high to reflect actual need Theres only a couple of things that could happen — is it going out the back door And Ive reported it to the city and let the city take a look at it But when you go from 10000 masks to 300000 masks  theres something going on Trump said during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on March 30 While there   there’s no indication this has driven up supply needs dramatically —

{"7552": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed a nearly 500 billion interim   bill into law Friday that includes additional money for the smallbusiness loan program as well as more funding for

coronavirus aid legislation During the ceremony Trump walked back his comments from the day before that people could get an “ ” of a “disinfectant” that kills the coronavirus telling reporters that  Trump also threatened to hold up the next round of coronavirus legislation if the US Postal Service does not raise its rates Democrats have been arguing for money to be included for the USPS in the emergency funding bills “The Post Office is a joke” Trump told reporters “The Post Office should raise the price of package delivery four times If they don’t raise the price I’m not signing anything” The bill passed the Senate earlier this week by voice vote and was   on Thursday on a 38851 mostly bipartisan vote The bill includes more than 320 billion for the   or PPP created by the   which was passed late last month The program which quickly ran out of money because of heavy demand provides forgivable loans to small businesses that keep their employees on the payroll About 60 billion of the additional PPP funding will be set aside for businesses that do not have established banking relationships such as rural and minorityowned companies Expanding access to the aid was a priority for Democrats who worried that some businesses were being shut out of the fund The bill also provides 60 billion in loans and grants for the Small Business Administrations disaster relief fund 75 billion for hospitals and 25 billion for coronavirus testing but does not include the additional funding for   that Democrats had sought Although the aid package totals nearly half a trillion dollars both parties have been referring to it as interim legislation meant to bridge the gap between the 2 trillion CARES Act and the next expansive round of coronavirus legislation Despite some points of disagreement and moments of gridlock Congress has now managed to pass four bipartisan coronavirus bills in the past few weeks moving at an unprecedented pace But there are warning signs that such cooperation could be coming to an end Democrats have said that funding for state and local governments is a top priority for them in the next bill and they hope to pass it quickly But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy   on spending bills raising concerns about the national debt and throwing cold water on Democrats’ insistence for additional state funding “Let’s weigh this very carefully because the future of our country in terms of the amount of debt that we’re adding up is a matter of genuine concern” McConnell told reporters this week after the Senate passed the interim bill McConnell also said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show” this week that he was “not ready to just send a blank check down to states and local governments to spend any way they choose to” adding that he would “certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route” McConnell’s comments drew immediate criticism from Democrats including New York Gov Andrew Cuomo “Senator McConnell who’s getting bailed out here It’s your state that is living on the money that we generate” Cuomo said of his state at his daily coronavirus news briefing Friday attacking the Kentucky senator for referring to states’ request for money as “blue state bailouts” Pelosi also criticized McConnell on Friday equating his refusal to fund states as “consistent” with Trump’s suggestion that people should consider an   to fight the coronavirus “What is also consistent with Mitch McConnell saying let the states go bankrupt they don’t believe in science and they don’t believe in governance and that’s why it’s hard to get them to accept the evidence that we have a role to do something to meet the needs of the American people in a very direct and stronger way” Pelosi said Trump has said that he was open to including more state funding in future bills but he expressed a similar sentiment to McConnell’s at the White House coronavirus briefing on Thursday saying some states had budget problems long before the pandemic “I’m open to ideas that are going to be great to the people of this country And if we can help states we’re always going to help states Now there’s different ways of helping states Some ways are better than others So we’re looking” Trump said “It is interesting that the states that are in trouble do happen to be blue It is interesting You know if you look around I mean the states that seem to have the problem happen to be Democrat” McConnell also said this week that he wants to bring the full Senate back to Washington for future rescue packages The Senate has passed the previous coronavirus legislation by voice vote or unanimous consent meaning lawmakers were not required to be present and were not on record voting for or against the bills “My view is we ought to bring everybody back have full participation to begin to think about the implications to the country’s future for this level of national debt” McConnell said Many senators have remained at home in their districts since they adjourned in March Democrats have been apprehensive about requiring lawmakers to fly back to Washington to work on the next bill in close quarters at the Capitol especially after   “If we were to come back prematurely and that were to set a bad example for people that’s a bad thing” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer DNY said Tuesday “I would like to be governed by the medical experts” Some Democrats appeared resigned to the idea that more aid would not be passed as quickly as they had hoped New York Rep Alexandria OcasioCortez the only Democrat to vote against the interim bill said that she was concerned that the fourth bill did not go far enough considering that there is no concrete commitment from Republicans to begin working on the next bill “We’re leaving again today with no plan to come back” OcasioCortez said after the Thursday vote “We have no date We have no commitment on when this CARES 4 is going to happen And so I have to vote based on what’s in front of us based on the fact that this is the only bill that we are going to likely entertain in the two months of this crisis And it is too small” Lauren Egan is a reporter for NBC News based in

ability to tackle issues he’s faced criticism for particularly whether he can help uplift the Black community  “The key right now and this is why I have so much confidence in your administration wanting to be a partner in harnessing that energy and bringing about concrete reforms concrete steps not just in the criminal justice system not just with respect to policing but with respect to investment jobs business development is going to send a signal of decency Obama said  Biden expressed his disbelief in President Trumps handling of the coronavirus pandemic and told his former boss that the biggest challenge will be creating jobs in the wake of the pandemic — Obama had begun the conversation by addressing how the duo handled the 2008 economic crisis and asked Biden how he is thinking of the economy now  Biden said there are three pieces to economic recovery Keep people from going under forever make sure businesses can keep people on payroll and cover overheard and then building the economy back better – plugging his  We have to change the way in which we deal with allowing people an opportunity to make a living That includes childcare that includes turning making

conversation  I always used to say the Affordable Care Act Obamacare Its like a starter house Its the first house you get And it its not the end of the process Its the beginning of the process Obama

is mind boggling that this governor who did not know that this virus was asymptomatic until we were well into the pandemic would waste resources on suing me personally and our city council for a mask mandate” Bottoms said on MSNBC Friday Kemps office said that the intention of the lawsuit is to challenge Bottoms decision to move the city back to Phase 1 of reopening which requires people to shelter at home and restaurants to close dining rooms though the lawsuit does also target Atlantas mask mandate While we all agree that wearing a mask is effective I’m confident that Georgians don’t need a mandate to do the right thing” Kemp said at a press conference that served as his first public remarks since becoming the countrys only governor to openly attempt to block a local government mask ordinance Jackson Mississippi Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said the divide between the state and local government response is evident to him each day The governor’s office has not provided leadership during the crisis except to decide to reopen the economy completely at the end of May although the states case count continued to trend upward he said Without state or federal leadership Lumumba said health protocols can change depending on what side of the street you’re walking on — because that’s how close some municipalities are to one another Gov Tate Reeves who did not respond when asked for comment only ordered a mask mandate for 13 of the hardest hit counties in the state on Monday Lumumba said the localized patchwork response still isn’t enough While Lumumba had hoped to take a slow phased approach he said Jackson quickly became an island as the communities surrounding it went back to business as normal State leaders haven’t provided significant help to its largest city and state capital the mayor said noting that Jackson is home to the state’s largest hospital system “When infection rates grow in the surrounding communities then its our hospitalization rates that are going to be impacted as well Its our ventilators that will be utilized at a much higher level And so thats another reason that we have been screaming out for partnership screaming out for continuity — were screaming out for an ability to share data” Lumumba said he fears that the state leadership has chosen to not work with the city for political reasons Republican state leaders recently displayed that politicization he said when they met at the state capitol in Jackson earlier this month and did not follow basic protocols including wearing masks or socially distancing from one another An outbreak at the capitol ensued —   — even though Lumumba had instituted a mask mandate for the city “It exemplifies just how committed we are to the political polarization that we see statewide and nationwide during this moment of crisis” Lumumba said “My position when Im telling people to wear facial coverings is listen if you dont like me or my politics just wear a mask to live another day to disagree with me The mask is not the political issue — it’s a health issue” Birmingham Alabama Mayor Randall Woodfin was one of the earliest city leaders in the South to put in a mask mandate instituting one back in March The point of the early order Woodfin said was to buy the city time and stave off hospitalizations But the Birmingham mandate in a county of more than 30 municipalities that chose different responses didn’t work Jefferson County where Birmingham is located is now a hotspot reporting nearly 300 new cases on Friday and its trend continues to point upward “You need coordination and the most important thing is the political courage to really be listening to the recommendations of the actual health experts” said Woodfin   during the pandemic “I can tell you that government and elected officials at various levels have not done that” Ivey’s office did not respond to a request for comment The inconsistent policy decisions by states in the South and the West regarding how they are responding to the pandemic has helped cause the recent surge in cases experts said “The idea that every mayor every governor every local official should figure out their own pandemic response and what to do and not to do is crazy” said Dr Ashish Jha the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute who led research on Ebola and currently advises policymakers on the COVID19 pandemic Jha explained the best way to respond to a pandemic is through national and state level guidance that is customized to local needs which states ultimately did in the Northeast when they faced their spikes early on — though he noted that governors there waited a week or two too long to react But with   and the guidance put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention federal leadership during the current crisis appears absent and state governors facing hot spots in the South are not all actively working to fill the vacuum “When I look at whats happening in Texas Florida and Georgia and other states my take is these governors are not doing nearly enough to bring the virus under control” Jha said “And they are really looking at weeks and weeks of more infections more hospitalizations and more deaths” John Cooper the mayor of Nashville warned at a press conference on Thursday in which he rolled back the city’s reopening that cases continue to be on the rise While the disease can be managed he said the vaccine is still far off “This is not over because we want it to be over” Cooper said “This is going to be a long sustained disciplined approach that’s going to require all of our efforts to get us back to normal” Cooper noted that the states with mask mandates had seen transmission and case rates decrease and that some state governors who were skeptical of enforcing such ordinances have begun to follow suit — seemingly taking a small shot at Tennessee Gov Bill Lee who said this week that he would not close any businesses or institute a mask mandate Lee’s office did not respond to a request for comment Alabama and Montana issued such orders on Wednesday however joining recent adopters like Kentucky Virginia and North Carolina   “More and more states are recognizing that within their jurisdictions they can only be as strong as their weakest link” said the Nashville mayor who has also decried the politicization of mask mandates and other coronavirusrelated orders But the fight in Georgia between Kemp and Bottoms appears to be political rather than looking to quell an outbreak that has killed more than 3100 Georgians   that the governor filed the lawsuit one day after she highlighted that President Donald Trump had violated her mask mandate when he visited the city Wednesday Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr pushed back against that characterization Thursday saying in a statement The State of Georgia continues to urge citizens to wear masks This lawsuit is about the rule of law Bottoms disagreed stating multiple times that she felt that the Georgia governor had made a decision to put “ ” which has led the state to have the fifth highest infection rate in the country Kemp has come under fire multiple times during the pandemic He was widely criticized when   shared earlier that month   could infect others and state officials misrepresented COVID19 case counts in May Bottoms said this is another occasion that Kemp has cared more about political optics than the health realities of the virus Other mayors in Georgia including leaders in Augusta Athens and Savannah implemented similar mask mandates before Bottoms introduced hers But Kemp only filed a lawsuit against Atlanta and not the other cities Van Johnson the mayor of Savannah and a Democrat   that the latest conflict between the state and a local government is a waste of time and resources Leaders at every level should be focused on the pandemic not political battles he said We’re fighting coronavirus on one hand on the other hand we’re fighting our own state” he said “How can we take care of local needs Johnson   when our state ties our hands behind our back and then says ‘Ignore the advice of experts’” Phil McCausland is an NBC
