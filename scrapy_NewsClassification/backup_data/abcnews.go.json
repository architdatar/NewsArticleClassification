{"72": "With President   saying he wants to lift stayathome   orders and open up parts of the country more than 45 economists social scientists lawyers and ethicists say theres a growing consensus pointing to a major step necessary to put Americans back to work dramatically upscaling testing In a report titled   released on Monday morning a blueribbon panel of thought leaders across the political spectrum called   a profound threat to our democracy comparable to the Great Depression and World War II Its a moment for a Can Do America to really show up and put itself to work Danielle Allen lead author of the report and a professor at Harvard Universitys Edmond JSafra Center on Ethics told ABC News The report says that ending the quarantine safely will require testing tracing and supported isolation a combination known by the acronym TTSI What people need to recognize is that a massively scaledup testing tracing and supported isolation system is the alternative to national quarantine Allen said We all had to learn PPE Personal Protective Equipment and we all had to learn about flattening the curve  now we have to learn about TTSI Test producers will need to deliver 5 million tests per day by early June to safely open parts of the economy by late July according to the report To fully remobilize the economy the country will need to see testing grow to 20 million a day the report suggests We acknowledge that even this number may not be high enough according to the report Some experts including Nobel laureate economist Paul Romer who did not assist in the report but has a similar approach estimate the country may need more than 30 million tests per day As of Sunday the virus had infected 755000 people in the United States and killed more than 40000 according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University More than 35000 new cases have been confirmed since Friday according to the data During a coronavirus White House briefing last week Trump said that 48 separate coronavirus tests have been authorized and that the   with 300 companies and laboratories to widen the nations testing capacity One of the largest biotech firms manufacturing the COVID19 test Roche Diagnostics said it is producing about 400000 test kits per week Abbott Laboratories which has created a 5minute test says it plans to boost its production from 50000 tests per day to 2 million tests a month by June and is also working to distribute about 4 million antibody tests  which shows if someone has recovered from the virus even people who were never symptomatic  by the end of April and about 20 million per month by the end of June Other companies are also ramping up the production of tests but making and distributing 20 million tests a day across the country is a daunting task  one that could require vigorous use of the Defense Production Act of 1950 which authorizes the president to require private businesses to accept and prioritize contracts for materials deemed necessary for national defense Trump has   specifically to order some companies to produce ventilators You can think of it as a Marshall Plan You can also think of it as Eisenhowers highway infrastructure building all those great roads across the country Allen said What we really need is for the federal government to set up a pandemic testing supply board that will coordinate the supply chain and achieve that massive ramp up as quickly as possible Some politicians have expressed skepticism in the federal governments ability to muster the political willpower to accomplish the type of testing that will be required to fulfill Trumps ambition to economically reopen the country as quickly possible During a private call with Democratic senators on Friday Vice President Mike Pence who is spearheading the White House coronavirus task force got an earful from lawmakers venting their frustrations with the Trump administrations coronavirus testing plan with some calling it woefully inadequate Maine Sen Angus King an Independent and former governor reportedly told Pence the administrations failure to develop an adequate national testing regime is a dereliction of duty a source with knowledge of the call   Pence and the administrations top   officials said on Friday that the United States has conducted about 37 million diagnostic tests  roughly 120000 a day  and argued that the US has the infrastructure to improve testing capacity New York Gov Andrew Cuomo whose state has been hit hardest by the pandemic said that a big problem with testing has been the lack of uniformity in the tests and a shortage of reagent chemicals necessary to run diagnostics on the tests It gets very complicated very quickly because you have the national manufacturers who sold their machines to local labs The local labs then need to go back to that manufacturer to run their tests Theres very little uniformity among the tests Youre trying to coordinate this whole private sector system Cuomo said during his daily coronavirus briefing on Saturday They have the test but they need the reagents to do a higher volume of tests Cuomo added When you go back to the manufacturer and say why dont you distribute more reagents they say one of two things I cant get more reagents because they come from China  We dont make them in the United States Or they say the federal government is telling me who to distribute to Cuomo said the manufacturers are regulated by the federal government and the federal government clearly has a role in addressing this crisis Despite criticism over testing Trump has said some states who were left relatively unscathed by the virus are ready to begin a phasedin opening of their economies The new report provides a pathway to open the economy and keep it open rather than have waves of people return to collective quarantine Florida Gov Ron DeSantis gave the green light to open some beaches around Jacksonville over the weekend South Carolina Gov Henry McMaster is reportedly set to   to reopen beaches and retail businesses Texas Gov Greg Abbott on Friday introduced initial steps to reopen his states economy in May including easing elective surgery restrictions reopening state parks and allowing all retail stores to provide product pickups Other governors are facing pressure from constituents to allow people to get back to work Protests against stayathome orders have broken out in Michigan Virginia California Kentucky Minnesota Ohio North Carolina Colorado Utah and Washington state in recent days According to the report bolstering testing requires eliminating chokeholds or bottlenecks in the supply chain Because nasal swab tests for example are considered biohazard material they must be administered by health care workers wearing protective equipment and shipped in special containers to a lab A safer faster alternative could be the socalled   that was granted FDA emergency authorization last week We ought to be able to have a way of doing testing that doesnt require PPE or you can just spit into this test tube We can get past the problem of having to transport biohazards and that should permit a pathway to ramp up Allen said And because COVID19 is a   that can remain dormant in the body the only way to know who has it is to test One of the biggest challenges with COVID is the number of people who are asymptomatic carriers Allen said Its hard to zero in on the number but 20 to 40 of people who have the virus are asymptomatic … That means youve got a whole lot of people out there spreading the virus around and we havent been able to do anything about it The new report says testing for the virus alone is not enough The panel also calls for   of people These human contact tracers  or disease detectives  notify anyone who might have been exposed to the virus and recommend they get tested  Contact tracing represents a triedandtrue health tool used to control the AIDS epidemic in the United States and other pandemics It means calling people finding who they have been in contact with and then contacting these individuals and having individuals quarantine at home for 14 days and have them call in to see if they report symptoms said Crystal Watson a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins and one of the lead authors of a recent study from Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security If those contacts are quarantined at home they do not expose anyone else and hopefully the transmission chain ends with them Watson told ABC News The Johns Hopkins study recommends investing 36 billion to hire and train 100000 contact tracing personnel The new report goes even further recommending hiring hundreds of thousands of contact tracers The key experts say is testing and tracing fast enough so that the virus doesn’t spread  getting the time frame down from days to hours Recently the state of Massachusetts hired 1000 contact tracers to reach out to people who may be at risk of infection Allen says the better the contact tracers are at their jobs the fewer the tests required The level of tests we need depends on how effectively we can trace peoples contacts warn those contacts about their exposure and test them and isolate those who are COVIDpositive Allen said While manual contact tracing provides a muchneeded human touch smartphone technology is also playing an increasingly important role in helping reduce the spread of the coronavirus The two go handin hand manual tracing reaches out to close contacts you know you have seen while digital tracing can alert people you don’t know who were close to you in public spaces Google and Apple   to enable governments and health agencies to use Bluetooth for proximitybased contact tracing while preserving user privacy and security Expected to launch in May the partnership will enable app users to receive an alert saying they should be tested if they recently crossed paths with or were in the same space as someone who tested positive Digital contact tracing has been used in China Singapore and South Korea Germany Australia and Denmark plan to introduce similar apps in the next few weeks and Australia is reportedly planning to use an existing app called TraceTogether which was used in Singapore If enough people download the app  estimates currently say about 4060 of the population in a given area  digital contact tracing has proven effective in shutting down the virus The success depends on notifying users early on that they have come into contact with an infected individual before they develop symptoms  Crucially notified users can then selfisolate before they spread the infection to others greatly reducing the rate of the virus spread overall And while concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse and mass surveillance especially in countries where information is sent to a central authority the report calls for preemptive regulation in the US to ensure security and maximal privacy protections The report details 4 specific phases to reopening the economy and ending the lockdown  40 of the population  including all essential workers health care workers firemen police sanitation etc  will be tested and their contacts traced Necessary isolation postcontact with infection will be supported with paid sick leave and other resources  70 of the population goes back to work  including workers directly supporting the health sector such as delivery service construction workers building engineers maintenance and food workers The government makes massive infrastructure investments   80 of the population is back to work including those who must work at locations and in offices   All workers return to work and schools reopen Continue to take precautions until a vaccine is widely available but the lockdown is over According to the bipartisan team who worked on the report implementing its plan would cost between 100 billion and 300 billion over two years But Allen suggested comparing the price tag to the astronomical cost the shutdown is accumulating Collective quarantine is costing us 350 billion a month  and weve seen the massive unemployment numbers Allen told ABC News Allen believes the road map can help America create capacity for a pandemic resistant society  one that is far better equipped to test for the next viral disease to come down the pike But she also worries that partisan politics might squash the bipartisan purpose behind the plan This has to rise above politics… Allen said Its about all of us succeeding No one wants to go to a baseball game and not feel safe Thats what we need to know to reopen the economy"},
{"5426": "Thousands of small business owners across the US have been   as the popular federal governmentbacked loan   and protect worker paychecks in the   fallout officially ran out of money Thursday morning That development comes amid a political standoff between the White House congressional Republicans and Democrats Talks were set to resume Thursday afternoon The roughly 350 billion Paycheck Protection Program PPP which experienced a very rough rollout is designed to cover eight weeks of a business payroll expenses so the company can retain its workers or hire back those it may have already furloughed and the loans are forgivable provided that 75 of the total amount borrowed is used for payroll expenses But as of midmorning Thursday  the   which administers the program read The SBA is currently unable to accept new applications for the Paycheck Protection Program based on available appropriations funding Similarly we are unable to enroll new PPP lenders at this time Its been so good its almost depleted but we cant get the Democrats to approve it President   warned in a Rose Garden press conference Wednesday night SBA indicated late Wednesday according to a congressional source that more than 15 million applications had been approved totaling more than 324 billion from more than 4900 lending institutions The administration has requested another 250 billion for the program but a political clash between Democrats and Republicans has let the funding lapse  Democrats have insisted that part of the funding be walled off for lenders that service minorityowned businesses and have push for another 250 billion for hardhit hospitals on the frontlines of the pandemic states and local governments suffering from revenue loss and a 15 percent increase in food stamps Republicans led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy have insisted on a straight 250 billion increase in PPP saying that Congress needs to wait to fund other needs until lawmakers see how their 2 trillion pandemic stimulus package has worked  The GOP leader tweeted Thursday Republicans tried to pass more money for Americans’ paychecks last week Democrats blocked it Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer DNY and his staff have been negotiating some kind of compromise directly with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin The Democratic leader tweeted Thursday Our small biz programs need more money now We all agree But Dems actually want to get it into the hands of all who need it Thats not whats happening when websites are crashing mom  pop shops and minority businesses are shut out bigger banks are loaning to fav customers Schumer told reporters on Wednesday that without the increased emergency aid Were going to have millions millions out of work Aides to leaders on both sides of the aisle continued to express hope that a deal would be reached soon The Senate is scheduled to come into session briefly on Thursday and the House on Friday at which time any business that has the unanimous support of members could be approved It is possible a deal would be supported this week in those sessions House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to GOP accusations that shes holding small businesses hostage to her demands that they say are not immediate The question for Republicans is why are you ignoring your state Why did you turn your back on the hospitals she saids referring to a Democratic demand that aid to hardhit hospitals be part of the package Pelosi told reporters Thursday that the next meeting of House and Senate Democratic leadership staff with Mnuchin would happen later in the day Negotiate negotiate negotiate Thats what we do said Pelosi Were hopeful Treasury staff will come back with something that strikes a balance with what we know we need to do It is inexcusable that the Paycheck Protection Program will grind to a halt tonight Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio said in a statement Wednesday In less than two weeks the PPP helped over 1 million small businesses receive forgivable loans Now millions of small businesses are in limbo because Democrats refused to put aside partisan politics and fund this bipartisan program Many businesses whose applications were approved before the funding ran dry are in limbo too The SBA has not specified how much of the allocated 350 billion has actually been transferred to owners bank accounts and many businesses ABC News has contacted havent seen their loans Larry Shulman who owns a home audiovisual company in Massachusetts applied for a PPP loan on the first day of eligibility April 3 Thirteen days later hes still waiting and his costs are growing ever higher Three weeks of payroll out of my pocket and still no money he said in an email If they dont reply I will have to lay off For Patrick Slaughter the owner of a small law firm in Knoxville the situation is becoming dire Hes being forced to consider closing the firm if the loan doesnt arrive soon I lost an attorney on Monday because I had to cut his pay along with everyone elses including mine Not sure how much longer we can stay afloat Slaughter said Meanwhile it remains to be seen what happens to lenders who have borrowers in the pipeline The head of the Consumer Bankers Association an industry trade group closely monitoring PPP told reporters that his organization was pushing SBA for guidance on what happens next noting that much was at stake We think any hour now well reach the 345 billion number for PPP  which is the actual number  and we know now there are 700000 applications that our banks have and are going through the underwriting process and havent been sent to SBA yet We think at the end of the day were going to need upwards of 1 trillion to satisfy the demand of the nations small businesses In a statement Wednesday Mnuchin and SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza urged Congress to appropriate additional money because by law the SBA will not be able to issue new loan approvals once the programs experience a lapse in appropriations"},

the event Marathon County saw   coronavirus cases as of Sept 16 and as the president publicly clashed with the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over a timeline for a vaccine After a brief pause in packed rallies over the summer the president has returned to fullsteam ahead with less than 50 days to go until Election Day He has begun holding multiple packed rallies each week that often break local guidelines and ignore the recommendations his own administration is promoting though in   and   Trump continues to trail Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the polls This week the COVID19 activity level for Marathon County is HIGH reads the countys coronavirus online   High is defined as a significant increase in cases in the past two weeks Fourteen people have   between July 15 and Sept 7 In the past several days we have seen an increase in the daily number of COVID cases reported to the Marathon County Health Department department spokesperson Judy Burrows told ABC News adding that the county has yet to experience the exceptionally large increases that some other Wisconsin communities are seeing Cases across Wisconsin have skyrocketed in the past couple weeks with the state reporting a record of   cases on Thursday State and local officials have attributed much of the increase in cases across the state to a spread among college students According to data released by the state there has been a significant jump in cases in the 18 to 24age range which tends to include college students Despite that the Trump campaign said the event is moving forward This will be Trumps second visit to Wisconsin in the past month  the president held a rally on Aug 17 in Oshkosh which is in Winnebago County There signs of a surge in cases showed a week after the presidents visit with a steeper spike over the past week The county reported a record 149 cases on Thursday Elizabeth Goodsitt a spokesperson for the states health department however told ABC News that theres only been one case linked to the Trump rally in Oshkosh As part of their routine interview people who have COVID19 are asked about any large gatherings they attended Goodsitt said One person who has tested COVID19 positive reported being at the Oshkosh visit However they reported other possible exposures as well So we cant say this event was or was not the cause Goodsitt said one possible explanation for the surge in Winnebago County could be the return of students to the University of WisconsinOshkosh adding that the health department doesnt have specific case counts related to the university And while the airport hanger rally will be mostly outdoors and the Trump campaign said it will check temperatures provide hand sanitizer and masks  if recent Trump rallies are any indication most supporters do not wear masks and no social distancing will be enforced The rally will likely violate state policy even if those precautions are taken In   updated last week the state advised the public to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people Marathon County does not have its own policy that prohibits large gatherings Burrow said but the county encourages anyone who attends any large gatherings to do what they can to protect themselves wear a mask social distance and stay home if you are sick Large gatherings of many people provides more opportunity for the virus to spread from person to person Burrows said Trumps rally has drawn strong rebuke from Democrats who say they fear itll only push Wisconsin further from a return to normal life There is so much that needs to be done and we dont need to have him coming here to Marathon County which had recordhigh COVID19 cases just yesterday for this super spreader event said Tricia Zunker a Democratic candidate for Wisconsins 7th Congressional District which represents Marathon County Zunker said the county is working so hard to you know get students back in buildings but that Trumps visit Thursday will do the complete opposite I think its a completely dangerous event that hes having here Zunker said speaking at a press conference ahead of the visit Ben Wikler chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party warned that Marathon County was not a place where we should be pouring gasoline on the fire Trumps visit really illustrates the difference between how Democrats are responding to this crisis versus how Trump is pretending its not happening Wikler said in a phone interview with ABC News ahead of the rally Biden Trumps opponent   for the first time this year at the beginning of September He met with the family of Jacob Blake a Black man shot by police in Kenosha and held a community meeting at a church with about 20 maskwearing attendees Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen Kamala Harris also   Similarly Harris held a small event that mandated masks and social distancing Asked if Biden will be waiting for the statewide spike in cases to fall before he returns Wikler said only that any visit Biden makes will look different than Trumps What youre not going to see is big indoor maskless rallies from Biden or any other Democrat here Wikler said Biden is very focused on Wisconsin and Im confident that we will see more of him but anything that you see from a Democratic campaign will be grounded in public health research and great care for the communities that are affected While the presidents rally in Wisconsin is outside at an airport hangar its unclear if social distancing or masks recommendations will be adhered to Thursday But at recent rallies it hasnt been enforced or required The Wisconsin Republican Party did not respond to a request for comment The president will next head to Bemidji Minnesota on Friday night Fayetteville North Carolina Saturday night and

coronavirus task force briefing earlier this week that her agency had data on coronavirus patients including race and planned to release that information Verma didnt provide a timeline and the data has not yet been released Warren paired up with Rep Ayanna Pressley and Sen Ed Markey both Democrats from Warrens state of Massachusetts and called on Verma directly to release the data on Friday We urge you to immediately release the data on COVID19 testing treatment including hospitalizations and Intensive Care Unit admissions and fatalities broken down by race and ethnicity gender and area of the country We are encouraged that you committed to releasing Medicare claims data of this nature in a White House press briefing on April 7 2020 Warren Pressley and Markey wrote in the letter to Verma obtained by ABC News We further call on CMS to continue releasing this data on a weekly basis throughout the duration of the coronavirus public   emergency they wrote Verma who attended the White House coronavirus briefing on Tuesday offered the information about Medicare and Medicaid data when the task force was fielding questions from reporters about the disproportionate deaths in African American communities from coronavirus We now have a code for coronavirus so we can actually stratify by demographic information so we can look at race as a factor We can also look at what the underlying health issues are as well So we will be providing that data very shortly We will be giving that analysis Verma said Dr Anthony Fauci the nations top expert in infectious disease also answered the question saying national data would be made public as soon as theres enough to make a meaningful statement Vice President Mike Pence who leads the coronavirus task force said the team was assembling that data now The calls for national data about coronavirus and race has grown louder over the last week as states and cities like Milwaukee New York and Louisiana have published their own data showing blatant and at times tragic disparities between white and black residents who are dying at  Seventy percent of coronavirus deaths in Milwaukee have been African Americans even though African Americans are less than a third of the county’s population for example Similarly in Chicago African Americans are 30 of the population but 69 of coronavirus deaths and in Louisiana African Americans are 32 of the population but 70 percent of coronavirus deaths In New York preliminary data showed Latinos made up 34 of deaths in New York City despite being 29 of the population while African Americans were 28 of deaths compared with 22 of the population But its not the first time Warren has called for such data nor is it the first time shes requested the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services release it Back in late March largely before states and cities had begun to make that information public Warren was one of the first to call for public data in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary   She and other legislators including Pressley asked HHS and its agencies  including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  to collect and report data about racial disparities and the illness spreading rapidly across the country Without the data she and others warned policy makers and researchers would be in the dark in addressing the existing health inequities already written into the system that risk accelerating the impact of coronavirus  by   on Scribd Warren Pressley and Markey however wrote Verma directly on Friday to request the data collected by Medicare and Medicaid administrators which they argued has been released in the past to track outbreaks including for hospitalizations and deaths from the flu and could be released immediately thus quickly providing the most significant trove of national data on the coronavirus yet The early data on the coronavirus pandemic is alarming people of color are getting infected and dying at disproportionate rates To effectively stop the spread of the virus and ensure equal access to free testing and treatment for communities of color we need to leverage all the data available to the federal government We have already called on CDC to release comprehensive racial and ethnic data and we are now calling on CMS to do the same Warren said in a statement to ABC News The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services has been used in the past to track outbreaks of infectious diseases including hospitalizations and deaths due to influenza” Warren Pressley and Markey wrote in the letter referring to a system Medicare and Medicaid Services has previously used to track data based on race ethnicity and other demographics during infectious disease outbreaks a Warren aide said There is no reason why this cannot be done to track coronavirus infections the legislators said in the letter The data could also be used to continue to track racial disparities down the road particularly to monitor disparities in uptake of vaccines and make sure communities are receiving them equally once one is available Data  both from states and on a limited level from the federal government  began to trickle in over the last week as political pressure intensified The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   though there were caveats The data was pulled from a small sample size during a limited time frame  14 states during the month of March  and race and ethnicity data was only available from 580 patients hospitalized for coronavirus out of a total of 1482 patients in the report Still its the largest amount of national data to have been provided so far  and it sheds new light on racial disparities seen in cities and states across the country that have collected such data According to the CDC even though the racial breakdown from the population in the report was 59 white 14 Latino and 18 black 45 of hospitalized coronavirus patients were white and 8 were Latino while 33 were black suggesting that black populations might be disproportionately affected by COVID19 Warren after reviewing the data said Ill keep pushing until we have comprehensive nationwide data to ensure that communities of color have equal access to free testing  treatment"},
{"394": "After backlash over President   suggesting that sunlight high humidity or possibly an injection of the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute could be COVID19 treatments the White House claimed Friday that his comments which many medical experts call dangerous or even deadly were taken out of context President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding   treatment a point that he emphasized again during yesterdays briefing White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines Later on Friday Trump then claimed that he was being sarcastic when he made the suggestion at Thursday nights White House briefing even though he did not appear or sound to be I was asking the question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen Trump said at an Oval Office signing for the Paycheck Protection Program I was asking a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside But it does kill it and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters At Fridays White House briefing Trump who often takes questions for two hours or more made a short statement touting progress and then left abruptly after about 22 minutes for the first time not answering reporter questions Neither Dr Deborah Birx the White House task force coordinator nor Dr Anthony Fauci the nations top infectious disease expert was present On Thursday Trump had suggested the controversial ideas at the briefing after calling up Bill Bryan head of the Department of Homeland Securitys science and technology division who presented new research that COVID19 survives for a shorter time in warmer more humid conditions and when exposed to direct sunlight But the president playing off what Bryan said and without evidence went on to suggest treating the body outside or even inside with ultraviolet light or injection of disinfectant that might kill the virus So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous  whether its ultraviolet or just a very powerful light  and I think you said that hasnt been checked because of the testing Trump said looking at Bryan And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body which you can do either through the skin or some other way and I think you said youre going to test that too I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute one minute And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning As you see it gets in the lungs it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it would be interesting to check that the president continued It wasnt clear and the White House did not elaborate on what if anything was taken out of context in news reports quoting the presidents own words as seen on national television and streams Lysols maker issued a statement warning people not to consume the product Due to recent speculation and social media activity RB has been asked whether internal administration of disinfectants may be appropriate for investigation or use as a treatment for coronavirus SARSCoV2 the statement said As a global leader in health and hygiene products we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body through injection ingestion or any other route RB said Bryan pressed by reporters said later that federal labs arent considering sunlight a treatment option He added that heat and humidity alone wouldnt kill the virus if people dont continue to practice social distancing  but Trump wouldnt let go off the possibility that maybe it can Maybe you can maybe you cant Again I say maybe you can maybe you cant Im not a doctor Im like a person who has a good youknowwhat Trump said pointing to his head The president also turned to a seated Birx the coronavirus response coordinator and asked whether she had ever heard about the possibility that heat could kill the virus Not as a treatment Birx said hesitantly Fever is a good thing when you have a fever It helps your body respond But not as  I have not seen heat or light I think thats a great thing to look at Trump added Former acting Homeland Security Undersecretary John Cohen now an ABC News contributor said that Trumps pattern of raising new unproven ideas at televised briefings can be outright dangerous It’s not a matter of whether the media or anyone took his words out of context It’s the fact that his raising these types of ideas and thoughts in public briefings as opposed to simply having these types of discussions in internal meetings is dangerous Cohen said The briefings should not be opportunities to brainstorm and raise ideas of imagination  it just causes confusion and can actually increase panic among the public or it can cause confusion among state and local authorities who are trying to figure out how to best respond to the emergency he said Trump has previously said that the virus will go away in April because of warmer weather though he was criticized for saying so well before substantial research backed up the claim On Thursday he pointed that out and also joked he was thinking about moving outside to the Rose Garden for the sunlight There’s been a rumor that you know   a very nice rumor that if you go outside in the sun or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses but now we get it from one of the great laboratories of the world Trump said at another point Thursday But Bryan warned that it would be irresponsible for us to say that we feel the summer will totally kill the virus Fauci was absent from Thursday’s briefing but has previously said that he wouldn’t count on warmer weather to stop the spread We do not know what this virus is going to do Fauci told the House Oversight Committee on March 11 You would hope that when we get to warmer weather it would go down but we cant operate under that assumption Before this President Trump had for weeks touted the promise of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential game changer in the treatment for COVID19  but since a new analysis of the drug’s use found a higher rate of death among patients who used hydroxychloroquine compared to those who received standard care the president has mostly stopped pushing it as a possible lifesaving treatment"},
{"551": "WASHINGTON  President   isnt telling the full story when it comes to executive orders on         coronavirus relief payments and   Over the weekend the president suggested that         his move to bypass Congress  with executive action calling for up to 400 in weekly unemployment assistance would mean immediate cash in hand for laidoff Americans during the pandemic Theres no guarantee of that His own economic adviser acknowledged Sunday that various details remained to be worked out including contributions from the states and that legal challenges appeared likely And on   Trump said he would pursue a “major” executive order to require   companies to cover preexisting conditions something that “has never been done before” Actually its been done before — with “Obamacare” a law that Trump is seeking to invalidate The claims came in a week where truth took a beating on topics from mailin voting to the virus threat A look at the claims and reality EXECUTIVE ORDERS TRUMP on how quickly laidoff US workers would get up to 400 a week bonus payments under his executive order “It will be rapidly distributed  They’re going to see it very soon” — news conference Saturday THE FACTS An imminent payment is unlikely if one comes at all It is an open question how many people will receive the 400 weekly benefit which is onethird less than the 600 previously provided by the federal government and how long it might take to arrive Trump’s executive order seems to leave it up to the states to decide whether to participate and also asks them to cover 25 or 100 of the cost a major hurdle when their budgets are already under severe strain White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Sunday insisted the first checks could come “in a couple of weeks” but acknowledged that the administration had yet to fully canvass the states to see if they would be able to afford their payment share Kudlow also allowed that the executive action could wind up in court Several lawmakers have questioned the legality of the orders which bypass legislation that would need to be approved by Congress On Saturday Sen Ben Sasse RNeb called the theory behind the executive orders “unconstitutional slop” “We think we can do it” Kudlow told ABC’s “This Week” But there was a new wrinkle Sunday night Trump told reporters that states could apply for federal dollars covering all or part of the 400 payments He said decisions would be made on a statebystate basis The previous supplemental unemployment benefit of 600 per week expired at the end of July ——— TRUMP on whether he was expecting legal challenges to his orders “I didn’t say that No no I didn’t say that” — news conference Saturday THE FACTS He did say it At his news conference a day earlier in Bedminster New Jersey Trump said “Yeah probably we get sued but people feel that we can do it” ——— TRUMP “Over the next two weeks I’ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring   companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers That’s a big thing  This has never been done before” — news conference Friday THE FACTS No executive order is needed to protect people with preexisting medical conditions because “Obamacare” already does that and it’s the law of the land If Trump persuades the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional it’s unclear what degree of protection an executive order would offer in place of the law The Obama health law states that “a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such plan or coverage” Other sections of the law act to bar insurers from charging more to people because of past medical problems and from canceling coverage except in cases of fraud In the past there were horror stories of insurers canceling coverage because a patient had a recurrence of cancer It’s dubious that any president could enact such protections through an executive order or Obama would never have needed to go to Congress to get his health law passed Likewise President Bill Clinton could have simply used a presidential decree to enact his health plan or major parts of it after it failed to get through Congress Republicans were unable to muscle their replacement through Congress when they controlled the House and Senate in 2017 during Trump’s first year Various GOP bills would have offered a degree of protection for people with preexisting conditions but the proposed safeguards were seen as less than what the law already provided The general approach in the Republican legislation would have required people to maintain continuous coverage to avoid being turned down because of a preexisting condition ——— VETERANS TRUMP “Our vets are very special We passed Choice as you know — Veterans Choice  And they’ve been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades and no president has ever been able to do it And we got it done” — news conference Saturday THE FACTS This is one of Trump’s most frequent falsehoods He’s incorrect that he achieved Veterans Choice when other presidents couldn’t President Barack Obama achieved it in 2014 Trump expanded it The program allows veterans to see a private doctor for primary or mental health care at public expense if their VA wait is 20 days 28 for specialty care or their drive to a VA facility is 30 minutes or more ——— FOREIGN INTERFERENCE TRUMP on the threat from Russia China and Iran of meddling in the US presidential election “The biggest risk that we have is mailin ballots  It’s much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in it’s much easier for them to cheat with universal mailin ballots” — news briefing Friday THE FACTS Mailin ballots aren’t the biggest risk for foreign interference Trying to influence a federal election through mailin ballots would probably mean paying thousands of US citizens carefully selected in pivotal states who are willing to conspire with a foreign government and risk detection and prosecution Far easier and cheaper would be a social media campaign seeking to discourage certain groups of people from voting which is something the FBI has warned about Or a cyberattack on voter registration data that would eliminate certain voters from the rolls That could cause havoc at polling places or election offices as officials attempt to count ballots from people who are “missing” from their voter databases On Friday William Evanina director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center warned about foreign interference and said Russia was already trying to undercut Democratic candidate Joe Biden Evanina cited in part Kremlinlinked figures who are “seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television” Last month Attorney General Bill Barr raised the possibility that a “foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots” He argued they would be hard to detect but that’s been disputed by election experts Absentee and mailin ballots are printed on special paper and must be formatted correctly in order to be processed and counted Ballots are specific to each precinct often with a long list of local races and would be identified as fraudulent if everything didn’t match precisely ——— VOTING FRAUD TRUMP “You look at some of the corruption having to do with universal mailin voting Absentee voting is OK” — Axios interview released Monday VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE “Absentee balloting is perfectly acceptable You have to apply for an absentee ballot signatures are checked it’s confirmed it is a long tradition  But this universal mail in voting where you’re going to see literally ballots showered all across the state  it is ripe for fraud” — Fox News interview on Aug 3 THE FACTS Trump and his vice president are making a false distinction Mailin ballots are cast in the same way as absentee mail ballots with the same level of scrutiny such as signature verification in many states In more than 30 states and the District of Columbia voters have a right to “no excuse” absentee voting That means they can use mailin ballots for any reason regardless a person is out of town or working In Florida the Legislature in 2016 voted to change the wording of such balloting from “absentee” to “votebymail” to make clear a voter can cast such ballots if they wish More broadly voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 000004 to 00009 based on studies of past elections Five states relied on mailin ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person “Trump is simply wrong about mailin balloting raising a ‘tremendous’ potential for fraud” Richard L Hasen an elections expert at the University of California Irvine School of Law wrote recently “While certain pockets of the country have seen their share of absenteeballot scandals problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on votebymail including the heavily Republican state of Utah” In an apparent turnabout Trump later in the week urged voters in Florida to vote by mail despite his rhetoric against the practice arguing in a tweet that its system is “safe and secure tried and true” Florida is a mustwin state for Trump where Democratic requests to vote by mail have been surging higher ——— STEPHEN MILLER White House senior adviser “Here’s a shocking thing for your audience to consider Nobody who mails in a ballot has their identity confirmed Nobody checks to see if they’re even a US citizen Think about that Any — any foreign national talk about foreign election interference can mail in a ballot and nobody even verifies if they’re a citizen of the United States of America” — Fox News interview on Aug 3 THE FACTS He’s incorrect to assert that measures aren’t in place to confirm a voter’s identity or prevent fraud with mail ballots Ballots typically require voters to provide identifying information such as a birth date or Social Security or drivers license number In most states voters also sign the back of the envelope which is then verified with the signature on their voter registrations Many jurisdictions use a bar code on the envelope which is used to help states identify any duplicate ballots and also let voters know if their ballot was received Miller ignores separate builtin safeguards for mailin ballots The ballots for instance are generally sent to registered voters who have to provide identifying information at the time of registration such as an address birth date and proof of citizenship In Miller’s hypothetical scenario of a foreign national improperly casting a vote that ballot would be flagged and rejected for not having a signature on file or for failing to match one that is Based on the envelope’s bar code state voting officials also could identify and eliminate any duplicate ballots whether they were submitted mistakenly or fraudulently ——— NEVADA VOTING TRUMP on mail ballots “There’s no verification of signatures So they don’t even know who’s going to sign this They have literally a clause that you don’t have to verify the signatures — that they don’t have to do it” — remarks Wednesday THE FACTS Not true Nevada’s existing law requires signature checks on mail ballots A new law also spells out a process by which election officials are to check a signature against the one in government records In Nevada’s June primary         nearly 7000 ballots were thrown out due to mismatched or missing signatures ——— MERCEDES SCHLAPP Trump campaign senior adviser “Even come Election Day you could still cast a ballot three days later if you don’t have a postmark or seven days later if you have a postmark  Say you vote for Joe Biden then you find out in Nevada that President Trump wins You can go to your family members you can go to your colleagues and say ’Guess what do you still have that mailin vote Let’s cast it because you can cast it several days after the election” — CNN interview Tuesday THE FACTS It’s a distortion for her to assert that Nevada voters could still cast ballots several days after the election Under the new law ballots must be postmarked or “cast” by Election Day to be counted Election officials are given up to seven days to receive and count those ballots after the election That additional time for receipt is routine practice in many states for overseas and military voters who submit ballots by mail Separately the law states that if a mail ballot is received up to three days after the election it can be counted if the date of the postmark is unclear or missing The aim is to provide enough time for delivery and processing of ballots that are properly mailed on Election Day though the Trump campaign alleges in a lawsuit filed this past week that the threeday provision would allow some ballots to be improperly mailed after the election and then counted That scenario is not the same as granting wide license to cast ballots “several days” after the election as Schlapp asserts The campaigns suit acknowledges that the window for alleged mischief is small because most mail in Nevada already takes at least one or two days to arrive Some of those ballots may display postmarks showing they were sent late which would disqualify them ——— TRUMP “What they’re going to do is blanket the state anybody that ever walked frankly will get one” — Fox News interview Wednesday THE FACTS His imagery of any living being in Nevada receiving a mailin ballot regardless of age or other eligibility factors is false The new law requires that ballots be sent to “active” registered voters “Active” registered voters are generally those with a current address on file with their local elections office There are additional requirements to be registered to vote In Nevada a person must be a US citizen and resident of the state at least 18 years old not currently in state or federal prison and not found to be mentally incompetent to vote by a court ——— NEW YORK VOTING TRUMP on two Democratic congressional primaries “They don’t know what happened to them is there fraud is there  it’s a disaster” — news briefing Tuesday THE FACTS While there were votecounting delays there’s no evidence of fraud in the         two Democratic congressional primaries in New York City that Trump refers to which were won by city council member Ritchie Torres and Rep Carolyn Maloney Nor did Trump offer any proof of fraud New York state decided to allow anyone to vote by mail in the June primary because of the coronavirus pandemic More than 400000 people voted by absentee ballot in New York City a figure that was 10 times the number of absentee ballots cast in the 2016 primary Opening and counting those ballots by elections officials took weeks New York City’s Board of Elections ultimately certified the results six weeks after the election ——— CORONAVIRUS TRUMP asked if a vaccine for COVID19 could become available before the election “I think in some cases yes possible before but right around that time I’m rushing it I am I’m pushing everybody” — interview Thursday on the Geraldo Rivera radio program THE FACTS He’s offering a more ambitious timeline than his health experts and omitting key facts Dr Anthony Fauci the government’s top infectious diseases expert has said he is “cautiously optimistic” that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready by early next year Even then Fauci made clear that the vaccine would not be widely available right away “Ultimately within a reasonable period of time the plans now allow for any American who needs a vaccine to get it within the year 2021” Fauci told Congress last month Under White House orders federal health agencies and the Defense Department are carrying out a plan to deliver 300 million vaccine doses on a compressed timeline That will happen only after the Food and Drug Administration determines that one or more vaccines are safe and effective Several candidates are being tested The push for a speedy vaccine has drawn concern from some scientists that the White House will pressure US regulators to approve a vaccine before it’s ready In         an oped this past week FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn said his agency will not be influenced by any political pressure and will make decisions “based solely on good science and data” ——— TRUMP “Children are almost — and I would almost say definitely — but almost immune from this disease so few They don’t have a problem they just don’t have a problem  And I’ve have watched some doctors say they’re totally immune” — Fox news interview Wednesday THE FACTS They aren’t immune Although it’s true that children are less likely than adults to develop COVID19 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has nevertheless counted more than 250000 infections by the virus in Americans younger than 18 or roughly 7 of all cases The number of kids who have been infected but not confirmed is almost certainly far higher than that experts say because those with mild or no symptoms are less likely to get tested Trump overlooks severe COVID19 illnesses and some deaths of children in the US even though kids in general tend to get less sick from it than adults do He also glosses over the fact that kids can spread disease without showing symptoms themselves The CDC in April studied the pandemic’s effect on different ages in the US and reviewed preliminary research in China where the coronavirus started It said social distancing is important for children too for their own safety and that of others “Whereas most COVID19 cases in children are not severe serious COVID19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group” the CDC study says The CDC in May also warned doctors to be on the lookout for a rare but lifethreatening inflammatory reaction in some children who’ve had the coronavirus The condition had been reported in more than 100 children in New York and in some kids in several other states and in Europe with some deaths

{"4706": "WASHINGTON  Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly resigned Tuesday bringing to a climax an extraordinary drama that he advanced by delivering a profanitylaced upbraiding of the officer he fired as captain of the  stricken USS Theodore Roosevelt In announcing the resignation Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Modly quit on his own accord putting the Navy and the sailors above self” so the Navy and the Roosevelt can move forward The Roosevelt is sidelined in port at Guam as members of the crew are tested for the coronavirus and moved ashore “His care for the sailors was genuine” Esper said Esper said he briefed President   on his conversation with Modly and with the presidents approval he is appointing James McPherson as acting Navy secretary McPherson a Navy veteran is currently serving as undersecretary of the Army He was confirmed in that position by the Senate last month Esper called McPherson a “smart capable and professional leader who will restore confidence and stability in the Navy during these challenging times” Esper said he also met with Navy leaders and emphasized three priorities including putting the health safety and welfare of the Roosevelt crew first and working to get the ship back out to sea as soon as safely possible Modly had created a combustible controversy by firing the Roosevelts skipper Capt Brett E Crozier last week saying Crozier had shown “extremely poor judgment” in widely distributing by email a letter calling for urgent help with the COVID19 outbreak aboard his ship Modly then flew to the ship at port in Guam and delivered a speech to the crew Sunday in which he lambasted Crozier saying he was either “too naive or too stupid” to be in charge of an aircraft carrier According to a senior defense official Esper spoke to Modly Monday evening directing him to apologize for his remarks about Crozier and setting a phone meeting for Tuesday morning The official said Esper did not request or demand Modly’s resignation but instead discussed the situation and the way forward The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations Modly came to his own conclusion and offered his resignation Modly’s options were few Officials said it would have been difficult for him to rebuild his relationship with sailors in the fleet and equally hard to restore his reputation among senior military leaders and retired naval officers who believed his sharp remarks on the Roosevelt crossed a line Asked about the resignation Trump said Tuesday that he didn’t know him or speak to him but credited Modly for resigning “to end that problem” It was he said an “unselfish thing to do” By the time Modly issued his public apology Monday night the calls among Democrats in Congress for his resignation were mounting On Tuesday morning House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Modly must go “Sadly Acting Secretary Modly’s actions and words demonstrate his failure to prioritize the force protection of our troops Pelosi DCalif said in a written statement “He showed a serious lack of the sound judgment and strong leadership needed during this time Acting Secretary Modly must be removed from his position or resign” Sen Jack Reed the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said Modly had fired Crozier against the advice of Navy military leaders The new leadership of the Navy must do better in leading and protecting sailors Marines and their families in this unprecedented crisis” Reed said As of Tuesday the Navy said 79 of the Roosevelt crew had been tested for the coronavirus and 230 of them were positive About 2000 of the 4865 crew members had been taken off the ship The episode began when the Roosevelt reported its first COVID19 case among the crew on March 22 two weeks after making a port visit in Vietnam The outbreak has sidelined the warship indefinitely and created conflict at the highest levels of the Pentagon Esper had publicly expressed his support for Modly’s decision to fire Crozier but after Modlys speech aboard the ship Esper grew unsettled Just hours after Modly issued a statement Monday defending his words Esper compelled Modly to reverse course and issue a public apology I want to apologize for any confusion this choice of words may have caused” he wrote referring to his speech aboard the Roosevelt “I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier his family and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday that he might get involved agreeing that Modlys criticism of Crozier was “a rough statement” He said Crozier made a mistake when he sent a memo to several people laying out his concerns about the crew and the virus In the memo which was leaked to the media Crozier said “We are not at war Sailors do not need to die” Trump said Crozier had a good career prior to this incident adding “I dont want to destroy somebody for having a bad day” Modly in his apology reframed his earlier remarks that Crozier was too naive or too stupid” to command Instead he said he believes Crozier is “smart and passionate” “I believe precisely because he is not naive and stupid that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship” Modly wrote Aboard the ship Modly had urged the crew to stop complaining “It is the mission of the ship that matters” he said “You all know this but in my view your Captain lost sight of this and he compromised critical information about your status intentionally to draw greater attention to your situation” Modly a 1983 Naval Academy graduate became the acting Navy secretary last November after         Richard Spencer was ousted from the position Trump last month nominated retired Rear Adm Kenneth Braithwaite the current ambassador to Norway to be the next Navy secretary"},

dont want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they are behind a mask Birx said Remember your eyes are not in the masks So if youre touching things and then touching your eyes you are exposing yourself in the same way Masks can keep people who are already sick from spreading germs Birx said but while you may be protecting others she said people shouldnt get a false sense of

when circuit breakers kicked in as the Dow plunged He announced he was signing the   which gives him the power to direct civilian businesses to help meet orders for products necessary for the national defense in addition to deploying two Navy hospital ships He said one would go to New York  the state with the most cases of COVID19 He later   on Twitter that while he signed the act he would only invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future With regard to his   to Americans to stimulate the economy and help workers losing jobs  checks that an administration official said could be 1000 or more  Trump said the amount is to be determined We are looking at different numbers We are looking at timing that would be different Splitting the time splitting the payments We are looking at a lot of different things It hasnt been determined yet but it will surely be determined before repeating a phrase he used in Tuesdays briefing Everybody seems to want to go big The president also announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April However HUD announced after the briefing that the suspension applies only to single family homeowners with a FHAinsured mortgage not renters Trump also said he planned to invoke a provision of the federal legal code that would allow the federal government to   of asylum seekers because of COVID19 The new measures come as the number of US cases of the   jumped overnight to nearly 6000 across all 50 states and as Americans enter the third day of a 15day critical period meant to   of the virus spread We’ll be invoking the Defense Production Act just in case we need it Trump said In other words  I think you will know what it is  and it can do a lot of good things if we need it and we will have it all completed signing it in just a little while right after Im finished with this conference Ill be signing it he said giving him the power to direct civilian businesses to help meet orders for products necessary for the national defense if invoked We are sending upon request the two hospital ships They are being prepared right now They are massive ships They’re the big white ships with the red cross on the sides One is called the Mercy and the other is called the Comfort And they are in tiptop shape he said Now its our time We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we will come through together Its the invisible enemy Thats always the toughest enemy Trump said But we are going to defeat the invisible enemy I think we are going to do it even faster than we thought and itll be a complete victory Itll be a total victory Ambassador Deborah Birx the White House response coordinator on the coronavirus raised concerns about reports coming out of Italy and France showing some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the ICUs We have not seen any significant mortality in the children but we are concerned about the early reports coming out of Italy and France Birx said Even if its a rare occurrence it may be seen more frequently in that group and be evident now Birx suggested that this uptick in younger people becoming seriously ill may be the result of that age group in Italy and France having taken fewer precautions to protect themselves because the early data out of China suggested they were less at risk compared to older people We think part of this might be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea that the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were at particular risk she said Birx went on to again implore the millennial generation to follow the governments social distancing guidance So again not only calling on you to heed what is in the guidance but to really ensure that each and every one of you are protecting each other She also took a moment to address the mortality rate If you look at all of the countries to date the mortality is higher at the beginning because you are diagnosing the sickest the ones who came in quite ill Birx continued on Wednesday You are seeing mortality or deaths today from infections that occurred 23 weeks ago in general Dr Anthony Fauci the nations leading expert on infectious diseases cautioned Tuesday it will take several weeks and maybe longer until we know were having an effect on   of the virus but said if Americans follow the 15day guidelines young people especially were going to see a hump instead of a peak Today I can announce further steps expand testing capacity We are working with several groups to determine if the selfswab the much easier process than the current process that is not very nice to do  I can tell you because I did it it Trump said He said that it would be administered also by a health official but it would be a lot easier to do Later he clarified that the FDA has not approved the selfswab test he mentioned at the start of the briefing but they are looking down the line and they are looking at it very seriously Proceeding to again blame previous administrations Trump said Nothing has been so contagious The level of contagion has been incredible actually Nobodys seen anything quite like this Weve inherited a very obsolete system This was a system that was out of date obsolete it was a system that was never meant to take care of the kind of quantity If you go back to years past even recently like the flu  nobody had tests before They didnt test the entire nation to see whether or not they had the flu They got the flu They got better Trump said Now all now all of a sudden they do this very complex testing Asked by ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Cecelia Vega if his use of the term Chinese Virus is racist Trump said its not racist at all It comes from China thats why It comes from China I want to be accurate he continued China tried to say at one point that  maybe theyve stopped now that it was caused by American soldiers That cant happen Its not going to happen Not as long as Im president It comes from China Asked whether he thought China should be punished Trump answered I dont know if you would say China is to blame Certainly we didnt get an early run on it Trump said It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier But it comes from China Its not a question When Vega asked him to clarify Trump said I dont believe they are inflicting the virus on the US but I think they could have given us a lot earlier notice absolutely We would have had a lot of dead people like we havent seen before Trump said if he hadnt acted to limit travel from China Trump also told Vega that a potential 20 percent unemployment rate as floated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as an argument to Senate Republicans to get a stimulus package passed quickly is a total worst case scenario and that the US is nowhere near it Well I dont agree with that No I dont agree Trump said Thats an absolute total worstcase scenario No we dont look at that at all We are nowhere near it We had the best economy weve ever had and then one day you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy But we are doing it and we are doing it well I tell you the American people have been incredible For the most part they been really incredible When I use the word calm that doesnt mean Im not taking it seriously We should be calm We should be extremely calm Trump said amid criticism that his administration didnt take the virus seriously from the onset inhibiting the governments response to it He also said at the briefing he planned to invoke a provision of the federal legal code that would allow the federal government to prohibit the entry of asylum seekers because of COVID19 42 US Code § 265 lets the US Surgeon General block people from entering the country to fight the risk of a communicable disease Asked if he’d invoke that Trump replied The answer is yes He said that would happen very soon probably today Trump said he didn’t plan to close the US border with Mexico like he did with Canada No we’re not going to close it But we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do Trump said President   tweeted Wednesday morning that by mutual consent the US will be temporarily closing the northern border with Canada to nonessential traffic adding that trade will not be affected During his opening remarks at a meeting with members of the White House coronavirus task force and representatives of American nurses in the late afternoon Trump announced his news conference on new measures the Food and Drug Administration is taking in the war again coronavirus will take place

trillion economic stimulus package including a measure to send checks to directly to Americans The White House late Tuesday night also requested 458 billion more from Congress  in addition to the trilliondollar package currently being negotiated  in order to cover unanticipated costs for an array of federal agencies fighting COVID19 The 1 trillion stimulus spending breaks down as follow 500 billion for two rounds of 250 billion of direct payments for Americans to go out around April 6 and May 18 300 billion to help small businesses meet payroll 50 billion for the airlines and 150 billion for loans and loan guarantees for other parts of the economy In a series of Wednesday morning tweets the president continued to referred to the novel coronavirus as the Chinese Virus  despite the Chinese government criticizing the terminology and his own health officials warning that doing so promotes hate incidents against Asians Secretary of Health and Human Services   told Congress last month Ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus Just one week after the 2020 census officially kicked off and invitations arrived in US mailboxes the bureau announced it’s having to pause field operations for two weeks In late May census takers around the nation will begin visiting households that have not yet responded to the 2020 Census to help complete the count the Census Bureau said in a statement As we continue to monitor the evolving COVID19 outbreak we will adjust census taker and survey operations as necessary in order to follow the guidance of federal state and local health authorities The statement went on to encourage the public to respond to the census online by phone or mail The president of the National League of Cities Los Angeles City Councilmember Joe Buscaino is demanding action from local leaders as calls have intensified to stem the coronavirus crisis now playing out across the globe Buscaino in a statement to ABC News called on his fellow leaders from coast to coast to lead the charge in curbing COVID19’s spread and encourage their communities to act responsibly “Local leaders across America are on the front lines of this unprecedented crisis” Buscaino said “I implore those cities who have not taken action to immediately take steps to close schools restrict access to public spaces and ask people to ‘shelter in place’” “This is not a drill We must act urgently” An aide familiar with the League said an alarm must be sounded to compel colleagues to act with a greater sense of exigence It comes just days after multiple sources told ABC News an emergency meeting to work on a resolution asking the Trump administration to call for a national shutdown of indining restaurants and bars did not come to fruition for the group Buscaino now looks to “lead with urgency” calling for FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineer to build infrastructures for additional intensive care unit beds that may soon be of vital need"},
{"1880": "Though the White House has not held an official   task force briefing all week President   has taken the opportunity at other scheduled appearances to take questions and applaud his administrations response to the   pandemic as a spectacular job At the tailend of a response to a question Thursday about the presidents senior adviser and soninlaw   declaring the governments response to COVID19 a success story Trump touted the US death total which has climbed past 60000 as very strong Our death totals our numbers per million people are really very very strong We are very proud of the job we have done he said in the East Room event on   Trumps push to reopen comes as the countrys economy sees its largest decline since the Great Recession unemployment claims break records and as a November presidential   approaches In an unannounced event Trump called reporters into the Oval Office Friday afternoon and announced the Food and Drug Administration has authorized Gilead for emergency use of remdesivir to treat COVID19 Im pleased to announce that Gilead now has a EUA emergency use authorization from the FDA for remdesivir  and you know what that is because thats been the hot thing also in the papers and in the media for the last little while the president said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn confirmed the authorization was issued today Vice President Mike Pence coronavirus response coordinator Dr Deborah Birx Health and Human Services Sec   and Gilead CEO Daniel ODay were also in attendance ODay said Gilead is working to ramp up production so there will be a greater supply the second half of the year He also theyll be donating about 15 million vials of the drug to hospitalized patients and will work with the federal government to determine how to best distribute the supply Because there are patients out there that can benefit from this medicine today that are hospitalized We dont want any time to waste for that the CEO said Birx took a moment to thank patients in the randomized trial that led them to conclude   might be an efficient treatment To the patients who were willing to be randomized and to the doctors who did the trials and the nurses who took care of them were very grateful because this clinical research is critical for these breakthroughs Birx said But obviously theres someone getting the agent and theres others that arent And so thats really been extraordinary The emergency use authorization   for remdesivir to be distributed and administered intravenously by   care providers as appropriate to treat severe cases of COVID19 in adults and children hospitalized with the disease The FDA officially confirmed the move in a statement While there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir to treat people in the hospital with COVID19 the investigational drug was shown in a clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some patients It also cautioned the issuance of an EUA is different than FDA approval   but in the absence of any approved treatments doctors are allowed to use it with patients now This is the first FDA authorized therapy for COVID19 treatment After previously   he predicted the US death toll to be roughly 60000 from the novel coronavirus Trump said the US will hopefully remain below 100000 deaths  but that it could have been worse People were thinking in terms of 15 million lives lost to 22 without the mitigation and hopefully were going to come in below that 100000 lives lost which is a horrible number nevertheless Its a horrible thing Could have been stopped Should have been stopped at the source but it wasnt the president said Think of it we could save anywhere from a million to even 1000005m and guess if you think about it we could save 21 25 million lives depending on what happens with this invisible enemy Trump added As we said nobody knows what really happens but weve learned a lot in the last two months Trump made

wont get ahead of the presidents decision or the timing of that decision but he takes this very seriously because the decisions of China that I referenced slowwalking some of that information put American lives at risk she said after reading a timeline of how she said China and the World Health Organization were slow to respond She was also asked whether the president supports armed   after he tweeted for the states Democratic governor to make a deal with her residents Friday morning to which McEnany said he was making a general reference The president was referencing generally that in this country you have a First Amendment right to protest she said He encourages everyone to protest lawfully and then also to engage in our social distancing guidelines which we think all Americans should

system are easing Cuomo said after meeting with President   that the USNS Comfort was helpful but could now be sent elsewhere after being docked for weeks off of Manhattan At an evening press conference Cuomo said having the ship had been worthwhile even as the need for it didnt reach the levels that had been projected “I believe Comfort not only brought comfort but also saved lives” Cuomo said Trump said at his Tuesday briefing that he asked Cuomo if “we could bring the Comfort back to its base in Virginia so that we could have it in other locations” Trump said they would bring the ship back soon The Navy ship arrived March 30 as state and city officials scrambled to add hospital beds to prepare for a potentially catastrophic surge in COVID19 cases But hospitalization levels appeared to have peaked recently amid strict stayat home restrictions Total statewide hospitalizations have slowly dropped to about 16000 more than 2000 below a week ago The Comfort has treated 179 patients with 56 on board Tuesday Earlier in the day Cuomo said hospitals in parts of upstate New York will be able to conduct outpatient elective surgeries again and he pledged to consider regional differences when reopening the states outbreakstalled economy Hospitals in selected counties can resume elective outpatient treatments April 28 if a capacity benchmark is met and there have been fewer than 10 new COVID19 hospitalizations in the county over the past 10 days “We’re going to allow it in those hospitals and counties in the state that do not have a COVID issue or we wouldn’t need their beds in case of a surge” Cuomo said at a briefing in Buffalo The hospital restrictions will remain in effect in hardhit New York City Long Island and suburban Westchester and Rockland counties as well as in 10 upstate counties Buffalo and Albany are in counties where the restrictions remain In contrast to crowded New York City hospitals some serving rural areas of the state have furloughed staff

Joseph’s Health said he was confident they can safely resume orthopedic bariatric vascular and other procedures As he plans for a wider economic reopening Cuomo said it was important to note that the outbreak hit regions of the state at different times and at different rates Rural stretches of northern New York are facing “a totally different situation” than densely settled New York City “We operate as one state but we also have to understand variations and you do want to get this economy opened as soon as possible” he said “And if the situation is radically different in one part of state than another part of the state then take that into consideration” Other coronavirus developments in New York ——— BY THE NUMBERS New York state hit a milestone with more than 250000 people testing

{"2682": "The United States is leading the world in the number of COVID19 deaths and cases but Secretary of State   said that doesnt mean the US isnt also leading the worlds response During a press conference Wednesday he defended Americas role in the world amid the global shock at what many see as the botched US response to the pandemic and President  s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization Of course the US remains the world leader in the pandemic Pompeo told reporters saying the world turns its eyes to American scientists and researchers to develop treatments and to US aid to assist the developing world in fighting their own outbreaks To date the US has provided 13 billion to more than 120 countries in emergency health humanitarian and economic assistance the State Department said Friday But the US has also mismanaged its own response with inadequate levels of testing or medical supplies negligible efforts to contract trace or isolate and a rush to reopen in certain states despite the ongoing threat according to public health experts The US passed the threshold into 3 million confirmed cases of COVID19 Wednesday with a death toll approaching 132000 The current state is really not good in the sense that as you know we had been in a situation we were averaging about 20000 new cases a day and then a series of circumstances associated with various states and cities trying to open up in the sense of getting back to some form of normality has led to a situation where we now have record breaking cases Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said Tuesday While Trump has repeatedly claimed the US has the worlds lowest mortality rate it actually has the ninth worst with 3982 deaths per 100000 people according to Johns Hopkins University We have really a tale of two countries We have places like New York where death rates continue to plummet because they were so high and now theyre coming down But in all the hot spots whether its Texas or Florida or Arizona death rates are starting to climb exactly as we worried about said Dr Ashish Jha director of Harvard Universitys Global Health Institute adding it means the national death rate will climb again Im really worried about whats happening in a lot of the hot spots At the same time Trump formalized his withdrawal of the US from the World Health Organization notifying the United Nations Monday that the US will depart the agency The decision has been roundly criticized by public health experts allied countries and even some top Republicans Certainly there needs to be a good hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with not in the middle of it said Sen Lamar Alexander RTenn chair of the Senate Health Committee If the administration has specific recommendations for reforms of the WHO it should submit those recommendations to Congress and we can work together to make those happen Pompeo didnt offer any specifics Wednesday instead blasting WHO for a long history of corruption and politicization  On balance that organization has not been able to deliver on its core mission for decades That contradicts what Pompeo said a little over three months ago telling Americans to be aware of and proud of our vast commitments to these important institutions They not only help citizens around the world but they protect Americans and keep us safe here as well Pompeo has previously accused the UN agency of failing to gather more data on the coronavirus outbreak in its earliest days and cowing to pressure from the Chinese government But the agency is largely powerless to push back on a government that does not provide it information a design of reforms the US helped implement over a decade ago The best way to rectify weaknesses in WHO and in wider global health governance is by remaining engaged and outlining a constructive vision for such reform Not by walking away in a politicized fit of pique said Jeremy Konyndyk a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development Withdrawing now particularly on such specious grounds will destroy US credibility and diminish US influence over the next generation of reforms that will inevitably follow the present outbreak One example of that with coronavirus was actually cited by Pompeo Wednesday Beijing claimed for months that it reported the outbreak of the virus to the WHO Now we know thats not true too We know the WHOs country office in China reported the outbreak only after it picked up a media statement from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission By the WHOs own bylaws it has no authority to demand that information on its own The early warnings WHO did provide were ample and included actionable guidance to countries that were paying attention added Konyndyk who served at the US Agency for International Development under President Barack Obama Had the US followed WHOs advice on early preparedness aggressive testing contact tracing and other response measures we would be in a far better place than we are today Instead the US exit now will likely damage the global response according to key US allies It is not a good idea to hamper the organization while in the full thrust and brunt of this pandemic Germanys deputy ambassador to the US Ricklef Beutin said Tuesday at the Atlantic Council Despite that opposition to US withdrawal Pompeo said the US has friends and partners in other Western democracies against Chinas authoritarian model which he called a fundamental and fatal flaw that makes it incapable of being transparent of accepting criticism Asked about the European Unions ban on travel from America however Pompeo said the two sides had made real progress technical progress on creating procedures and protocols to monitor and measure travel while allowing it to resume in some restricted way But he did not provide any specifics or a timeline"},

{"4623": "More than half of Americans who went out in public in the last week say theyve worn a face mask as an overwhelming majority of Americans remain concerned over the reach of the novel   – and less are optimistic about the fight against and ultimate impact of the outbreak  according to a   released Friday After conflicting guidance over the last several weeks about   as a prophylactic measure 55 of Americans who left their home in the last week said they wore a face mask or face covering while 45 said they did not Only a little over one in five are more optimistic in recent days about the effect of the pandemic on the country The latest coronavirus poll conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos’ Knowledge Panel asked Americans about their attitudes towards the president their concerns over the pandemic their optimism and pessimism about the impact of the virus on American life and whether they are taking the precaution of donning a face covering when they leave home One of the main forces driving Americans views is partisanship with respondents appearing as divided over the coronavirus as they are over   This is even the case when it comes to wearing a face mask or covering in public There is a 22 percentage point difference between Democrats 69 and Republicans 47 on wearing a mask with a slight majority of Republicans 53 electing to not wear a mask in public The nomask wearers stand at 31 for Democrats Independents fall far closer to Republicans on this issue with 49 choosing to wear a mask and 51 not The partisan divisions are less stark and have grown closer over the month of ABC NewsIpsos surveys when it comes to concerns over contracting the disease with 90 of Democrats and 82 of Republicans reporting that they are concerned

with 61 of nonwhites and 52 of whites opting to wear a face covering when they leave home and 39 of nonwhites and 48 of whites choosing not to wear a mask in public The poll was conducted during a twoday stretch from April 8 to 9 when two of the nations hot spots in the crisis hinted at relatively more encouraging signs about their efforts to confront the crushing crisis than in recent weeks  even as most of the country remains shuttered New York Gov Andrew Cuomo offered cautious optimism during his daily briefing on Wednesday  when he reported that hospitalizations in the state considered the epicenter of the virus are flattening But still the loss of life remains devastating with New York seeing a oneday high in deaths 799 from Wednesday to Thursday We are flattening the curve by what

minority small business owners uncomfortable with opening up when Georgia permits business for hair salons barbershops and tattoo parlors across the state to resume and stuck between the prospect of either choosing safety or helping their employees get income After several days of thinking about reopening Stephens decided the risks outweighed the benefits “I’ll be honest with you I’m a little

clearly and the president guidelines made it very clear about the expectations of phase one”  indicated at a recent White House Taskforce briefing that he spoke to Georgia Gov Brian Kemp and said he opposed the decision to reopen some small businesses They can wait a little bit longer just a little bit not much because safety has to predominate we have to have that Trump said So I told the

majority of businesses will be allowed to reopen on May 1st Health experts say such a decision to reopen small businesses by the governors of these states could potentially put an already vulnerable racial group susceptible to COVID19 at increased risk of contracting the disease further complicating the problem of ensuring there are enough tests for people showing verifiable symptoms Georgia hair stylist Brenda Gee 61 says her doctor told her to presume that she had the   when she showed up to an urgent care center with shortness of breath wheezing and coughing Even with those symptoms her

spend the money I get what good is it to open” she said “It just doesn’t make any sense it’s almost like they’re trying to give us a death wish” Though data from the   medical experts don’t believe they have been going downward long enough to safely reopen small businesses “I worry very much that communities of color who’ve already been disproportionately impacted by COVID19 will be affected by the kinds of policies that the governor of Georgia and others are enacting in terms of the kinds of businesses that they’re reopening” said Dr Harry Heiman of Georgia State University’s School of Public Health Despite Georgia Republican Gov Kemp’s decision permitting small businesses statewide to reopen the state’s local NAACP chapter is asking minority business owners in particular to avoid reopening if they can “Our main message is to continue to shelter in place continue to socially distance and continue to quarantine as necessary” said James Major Woodall NAACP Georgia State Conference President Several mayors across the state complain that Governor Kemp a Republican did not consult with them before making a decision to reopen “I work very well with our governor and I

outbreaks of coronavirus outside of the Atlanta metro area More than 1400 cases were reported in the county on Tuesday with approximately 70 percent of those cases being linked to AfricanAmericans “Me

Charleston South Carolina “People need to think twice about using those particular services” State health officials say more than 4600 people in South Carolina have contracted the coronavirus with nearly 60 percent of those cases impacting African Americans Tennessee has had over 7200 confirmed cases of COVID19 with 152 deaths so far Public health experts believe cities across the state

{"5510": "As the   in large parts of the country pressure from health experts and local officials is mounting for Americans to wear masks or face coverings and congressional Republicans are telling President   he should do the same A Fox host he routinely watches said Tuesday he should set a good example It comes as Vice President Mike Pence facing reporters claimed the president has been clear in his support of masks even saying hes worn one in public  which he has not With President Trump ramping up his reelection campaign as the   rages across the southern United States GOP Sen Lamar Alexander of Tennessee who is not running for reelection warned The stakes are too high for this political debate about proTrump antiTrump mask to continue Unfortunately this simple lifesaving practice has become part of the political debate that says this if youre for Trump you dont wear a mask if youre against Trump you do Alexander said as he chaired a Senate hearing on the state of the crisis with Dr Anthony Fauci and other health experts He pointed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research showing wearing a mask significantly slows the spread Thats why Ive suggested that the president occasionally wear a mask even though in most cases its not necessary for him to do so he added The president has plenty of admirers They would follow his lead Alexander joins a growing chorus of calls from congressional Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to wear masks Sen Lisa Murkowski RAlaska said she thought it would be helpful if Trump would wear one I think that we all should be wearing masks and I think it would help if the president were to do so as well I think that that says that we all have a level of personal responsibility Murkowski said And a similar plea came from Sen Mitt Romney RUtah the only Republican senator who voted to to remove Trump from office If the president wants to make clear that he is fully supportive of people wearing masks that would be very helpful Romney said Tuesday Even Trump allies at Fox News are sending the message Fox and Friends cohost Steve Doocy on Tuesday morning said it would set a good example for Trump to use one Hed be a good role model I dont see any downside to the president wearing a mask in public the conservativehost   during an interview Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel MAGA should now stand for Masks Are Great Again Let me give you some marketing advice right there he added Fox host Sean Hannity too whom Trump has called one of favorite journalists also suggested Monday night more Americans should consider wearing them I went to my grocery store every week Guess what They wore masks Nobody at my grocery store thank God got coronavirus Hannity   I think they work And I said  especially if I wear a mask and it opens up baseball concerts NFL football  Id rather wear the mask and go to the game to protect Grandpa Grandma Ma and Dad and watch the ball game The abrupt shift in conservative thought reflects both   and   that masks are effective in slowing the spread of the virus  but it stands in clear contradiction to President Trumps messaging White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday asked if Trump would wear one at the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville Florida in August since the city made them mandatory in public said its his choice to wear a mask even as he recommended others follow guidance of state and local officials I talked to the president before coming out here McEnany said Its his choice to wear a mask Its the personal choice of any individual as to whether to wear a mask or not He encourages people to make whatever decision is best for their safety but he did say to me he has no problem with masks and to do whatever your local jurisdiction requests of you Fauci and other top health officials at the Senate hearing sung the praises of masks as Fauci warned the US could see 100000 cases a day if the country doesnt get the spread under control One way to do that suggested Sen   IVt would be for the federal government to distribute masks for free or at low cost to all American households as countries including South Korea France and Austria have done for their citizens he said before asking the witnesses if theyd support it Yes of course Fauci said Anything that furthers the use of mask whether its giving out free masks any other mechanism I am thoroughly in favor of CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield added It is critical that we all take the personal responsibility to slow the transmission of COVID19 and embrace the universal use of face coverings While the hearing was underway former Vice President Joe Biden Trumps presumptive political opponent in November in a campaign speech Tuesday called the presidents response the coronavirus crisis a failure and used masks as an example of how hes divided the country over the pandemic We cant continue half wearing masks and halfrejecting science Biden said Wear a mask keep your distance limit the size of crowds Mr President this is not about you Its about the health and well being of the American public While Trump and Biden present their conflicting leadership styles to the American people financial institutions are also weighing in whats become a political issue Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said his team investigated the link between face masks and COVID19 health and economic outcomes and found a national mask mandate could save the country from a huge economic hit  a point that may grab Trumps attention These calculations imply that a face mask mandate could potentially substitute for lockdowns that would otherwise subtract nearly 5 from GDP the economist wrote in a note to clients Though the CDC first recommended face masks or covering for Americans on April 3 some studies have since found if masks had been mandated earlier lives could have been saved The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluations   model often cited by the White House predicts that more than 175000 people in the US will die from COVID19 by Oct 1 That number would drops by tens of thousands to 146000 deaths if 95 of the population wore a mask or covering around others Pence head of the coronavirus task force has also urged more Americans to wear masks in the last few days repeating several times at a coronavirus task force briefing Tuesday Wear a mask Questioned by ABCs John Parkinson about the presidents reluctance to wear one Pence replied Well the presidents worn a mask in public as have I And youve heard a strong encouragement about mask wearing The vice presidents reference wasnt immediately clear During a visit in to a Ford plant in Detroit in late May President Trump said he wore one in the back area but not openly because he didnt want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it Pence went on to paint the administration as being clear in its message on masks even as Trump has not conveyed it himself The vice president has stepped up his rhetoric around masks significantly since Sunday when he visited the hotspot state of Texas and said Wearing a mask is just a good idea Hours earlier Pence spoke at a megachurch in Dallas with over 2000 congregants and a 100person choir  standing close and none wearing masks while singing  though the CDC has warned of the super spreader potential Even as more states and cities adopt mask mandates citing public health and safety not all Republicans are on board with the science Sen Rand Paul RKy who graduated from Duke University Medical School said in the coronavirus hearing Tuesday We shouldnt presume that a group of experts somehow knows whats best for everyone Republican Gov Kristi Noem of South Dakota told Fox News Monday night we wont be social distancing at Trumps Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore Noem added that while the state would provide masks to those attending

{"354": "A day after   reported its first case of novel   Gov Andrew Cuomo delivered words of confidence to residents This isnt our first rodeo Cuomo said at a March 2 press conference We are fully coordinated and we are fully mobilized and we are fully prepared to deal with the situation as it develops The governor however struck a much different tone perhaps his most sobering yet during a press conference on Tuesday We underestimated this virus Its more powerful Its more dangerous than we expected Cuomo said warning there is no end in sight There are at least 93000 diagnosed coronavirus cases in New York with more than 2000 deaths reported according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University The same day Cuomo who has been   for his response made his remarks President   and his administration addressed the nation and called New Yorks response a very late start Heres a comparison of how New York and the Trump administration responded to the pandemic during the month of March Cuomo announced New Yorks first confirmed   patient a woman in her late 30s believed to have contracted the virus in Iran There is no cause for surprise  this was expected As I said from the beginning it was a matter of when not if there would be a positive case of novel coronavirus in New York Cuomo said He assured New Yorkers that the general risk in the state remains low Cuomo announced that the Wadsworth Center a public health laboratory within the State Department of Health in Albany was partnering with hospitals to expand testing capacity to 1000 tests per day The governor also said a new cleaning protocol was being introduced in schools and for public transportation to help contain any spread Cuomo reported the states second confirmed case along with measures to better equip New York to handle potential spread He signed a 40 million emergency management authorization to bring in additional staffing and equipment Cuomo also amended his Paid Sick Leave budget to safeguard employees who had to stay home from work to isolate or quarantine Confirmed cases began to slowly rise in New York with Cuomo reporting a total of 11 up from two from the day before A major point of concern at the time were cases in Westchester County which stemmed from a 50yearold attorney who tested positive Three members of the mans family tested positive  his wife son and daughter  as well as a neighbor who drove him to the hospital according to Cuomo who warned that the number of cases in that county would reach dozens and dozens and dozens About 1000 were asked to selfquarantine in Westchester More measures were enacted including temporary closures of some schools and a synagogue Confirmed cases in New York rose to 22 according to Cuomo with most in Westchester County Cuomo urged New Yorkers to remain vigilant Luckily in this country and certainly in this state we have the most sophisticated health care system probably on the globe So were coordinated were on top of it were diligent But we also have to keep it all in focus he said New York cases jumped from the morning to the afternoon with Cuomo reporting 33 and then 44 most still in Westchester County Im not urging calm Im urging reality he said Im urging a factual response as opposed to an emotional response A state of emergency was declared in New York after total confirmed cases rose to 76 and reached 89 later in the day Cuomo said the declaration allowed for the government to help local health departments that are very stressed The total number of confirmed cases in New York reached 105 and Cuomo urged those who could to work from home Cuomo also criticized the federal governments response saying We mobilized quickly but the federal government has been slow off the mark and they continue to be slow Thats unacceptable  we need them to approve these private labs today so we can stay ahead of this evolving situation New York reported 142 confirmed cases according to Cuomo He continued to urge the federal government to approve testing in the state At the time Northwell Health the states largest health care provider was completing 75 to 80 samples of manual testing per day but automated testing on thousands of samples per day still lacked federal approval New York reported 173 confirmed cases according to Cuomo With the majority still in Westchester County in New Rochelle Cuomo closed down the schools houses of worship and large gatherings within a mile radius of the city from March 12 to March 25 As the number of positive cases rises I am urging all New Yorkers to remember the bottom line We talk about all this stuff to keep the public informed  not to incite fear  and if you are not a member of the vulnerable population then there is no reason for excess anxiety Cuomo said Confirmed cases in New York rose to 216 according to Cuomo who also said the state had contracted 28 private labs to conduct testing Were continuing to prioritize ramping up testing capacity because the more people you identify as having the virus the better you can contain it Cuomo said Restrictions in New York increased with Cuomo announcing that there could be no gatherings of more than 500 people and that any gatherings of fewer than 500 had to reduce capacity by 50 Confirmed cases hit 325 Cuomo spoke highly about drivethrough testing in New Rochelle noting that he was prioritizing the city because of the high number of cases there He also said he anticipated over the next week to increase testing to about 6000 per day from 3000 Confirmed cases reached 421 in New York The first two deaths were reported in New York as confirmed cases climbed to 613 Our goal is to slow the spread of the virus to a rate that the health care system can manage and were doing that through aggressive testing and strong social distancing protocols Cuomo said The governor acknowledged that the anticipated wave of new cases threatens to crash our health care system and we need national action from the federal government to address the quickly evolving situation now such as localizing testing federalizing shutdowns and tasking the Army Corps of Engineers to expand hospital capacity Schools are ordered to close in New York City Westchester County and Suffolk County as statewide confirmed cases reached 729 Cuomo banded together with New Jersey Gov Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov Ned Lamont to announce that the states were limiting crowd capacity for recreational and social gatherings to 50 people Restaurants and bars were also ordered to close for dining in but they still could offer takeout or delivery Movie theaters gyms and casinos had to close This is not a war that can be won alone which is why New York is partnering with our neighboring states to implement a uniform standard  I have called on the federal government to implement nationwide protocols but in their absence we are taking this on ourselves Cuomo said Cuomo delivered a powerful speech on coming together as Americans This is an extraordinary time in this nations history It will go down in the history books as one of those moments of true crisis and confusion and chaos Cuomo said Everybody is afraid Everybody is nervous  What does government do in this moment It steps up it performs it does what its supposed to do It does it better than its ever done it before Confirmed cases in New York rose 432 to 1374 Cuomo ordered all nonessential businesses to decrease inoffice workforces by 50 as confirmed cases climbed to 2382 He also reiterated that New York would not follow other states by implementing shelter in place measures Cuomo ordered all businesses that rely on inoffice personnel to decrease inoffice employees by 75 as the confirmed cases hit 4152 Cuomo announced all nonessential businesses across the state would have to close under his New York State on PAUSE order Confirmed cases reached 7102 Cuomo said the state would be taking new actions to increase the supply of personal protective equipment Confirmed cases hit 10356 He also urged New Yorkers to practice humanity during this difficult time Yes we can be tough Yes this is a dense environment It can be a difficult environment It can also be the most supportive courageous community that you have ever seen Cuomo said That is why I am proud to be a New Yorker and to be governor of this great state Cuomo announced temporary hospitals would be constructed as confirmed cases rose to 15168 We will overcome this and America will be the greater for it Cuomo said And my hope is that New York is going to lead the way forward and together we will Cuomo said the federal government had deployed hundreds of thousands of masks gloves gowns and face shields to New York Confirmed cases reached 20875 but Cuomo urged residents to continue to look at the facts Many people will get the virus but few will be truly endangered he said Cuomo said again hundreds of thousands more masks gloves gowns and face shields were being deployed Confirmed cases rose to 25665 Cuomo called New York the canary in the coal mine as cases rose to 30811 We have the most positive cases in the nation and the most critical need for equipment and personnel Cuomo said Confirmed cases in New York rose to 37258 Cuomo said he hoped to have a facility to take more than 1000 patients as an overflow site in each New York City borough and in downstate counties Cuomo applauded the National Guard for stepping up for New Yorkers to help fight the spread  they brought medical supplies and were establishing medical stations The confirmed cases hit 44635 Cases in New York increased to 52318 Cuomo said he had not spoken to the president about such a quarantine and didnt know what it would entail I dont even know what that means I dont know how that could be legally enforceable Cuomo said Cuomo ordered all nonessential workers to stay home for an additional two weeks through April 15 Confirmed cases reached 59513 Cuomo welcomed the USNS Comfort to New York City to provide more hospital beds Confirmed cases in the state reached 66497 Confirmed cases in New York reached 75795

{"3840": "BEIJING  When police arrested the middleaged Uighur woman at the height of China’s coronavirus outbreak she was crammed into a cell with dozens of other women in a detention center There she said she was forced to drink a medicine that made her feel weak and nauseous guards watching as she gulped She and the others also had to strip naked once a week and cover their faces as guards hosed them and their cells down with disinfectant “like firemen” she said “It was scalding” recounted the woman by phone from Xinjiang declining to be named out of fear of retribution “My hands were ruined my skin was peeling” The government in China’s far northwest Xinjiang region is resorting to draconian measures to combat the coronavirus including physically locking residents in homes imposing quarantines of more than 40 days and arresting those who do not comply Furthermore in what experts call a breach of medical ethics some residents are being coerced into swallowing traditional Chinese medicine according to government notices social media posts and interviews with three people in quarantine in Xinjiang There is a lack of rigorous clinical data showing traditional Chinese medicine works against the virus and one of the herbal remedies used in Xinjiang Qingfei Paidu includes ingredients banned in Germany Switzerland the US and other countries for high levels of toxins and carcinogens The latest grueling lockdown now in its 45th day comes in response to 826 cases reported in Xinjiang since midJuly China’s largest caseload since the initial outbreak But the Xinjiang lockdown is especially striking because of its severity and because there hasn’t been a single new case of local transmission in over a week Harsh lockdowns have been imposed elsewhere in China most notably in Wuhan in Hubei province where the virus was first detected But though Wuhan grappled with over 50000 cases and Hubei with 68000 in all many more than in Xinjiang residents there weren’t forced to take traditional medicine and were generally allowed outdoors within their compounds for exercise or grocery deliveries The response to an outbreak of more than 300 cases in Beijing in early June was milder still with a few select neighborhoods locked down for a few weeks In contrast more than half of Xinjiang’s 25 million people are under a lockdown that extends hundreds of miles from the center of the outbreak in the capital Urumqi according to an AP review of government notices and state media reports Even as Wuhan and the rest of China has mostly returned to ordinary life Xinjiangs lockdown is backed by a vast surveillance apparatus that has turned the region into a digital police state Over the past three years Xinjiang authorities have swept a million or more Uighurs Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities into various forms of detention including extrajudicial internment camps under a widespread security crackdown After being detained for over a month the Uighur woman was released and locked into her home Conditions are now better she told the AP but she is still under lockdown despite regular tests showing she is free of the virus Once a day she says community workers force traditional medicine in white unmarked bottles on her saying she’ll be detained if she doesn’t drink them The AP saw photos of the bottles which match those in images from another Xinjiang resident and others circulating on Chinese social media Authorities say the measures taken are for the wellbeing of all residents though they haven’t commented on why they are harsher than those taken elsewhere The Chinese government has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang at times clashing violently with many of the region’s native Uighurs who resent Beijing’s heavyhanded rule “The Xinjiang Autonomous Region upheld the principle of people and life first…and guaranteed the safety and   of local people of all ethnic groups” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a press briefing Friday Xinjiang authorities can carry out the harsh measures experts say because of its lavishly funded security apparatus which by some estimates deploys the most police per capita of anywhere on the planet “Xinjiang is a police state so it’s basically martial law” says Darren Byler a researcher on the Uighurs at the University of Colorado “They think Uighurs can’t really police themselves they have to be forced to comply in order for a quarantine to be effective” Not all the recent outbreak measures in Xinjiang are targeted at the Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities Some are being enforced on China’s majority Han residents in Xinjiang as well though they are generally spared the extrajudicial detention used against minorities This month thousands of Xinjiang residents took to social media to complain about what they called excessive measures against the virus in posts that are often censored some with images of residents handcuffed to railings and front doors sealed with metal bars One Han Chinese woman with the last name of Wang posted photos of herself drinking traditional Chinese medicine in front of a medical worker in full protective gear “Why are you forcing us to drink medicine when we’re not sick” she asked in a Aug 18 post that was swiftly deleted “Who will take responsibility if there’s problems after drinking so much medicine Why don’t we even have the right to protect our own  ” A few days later she simply wrote “I’ve lost all hope I cry when I think about it” After the heavy criticism the authorities eased some restrictions last week now allowing some residents to walk in their compounds and a limited few to leave the region after a bureaucratic approval process Wang did not respond to a request for interviews But her account is in line with many others posted on social media as well as those interviewed by the AP One Han businessman working between Urumqi and Beijing told the AP he was put in quarantine in midJuly Despite having taken coronavirus tests five times and testing negative each time he said the authorities still haven’t let him out – not for so much as a walk When he’s complained about his condition online he said he’s had his posts deleted and been told to stay silent “The most terrible thing is silence” he wrote on Chinese social media site Weibo in midAugust “After a long silence you will fall into the abyss of hopelessness” “I’ve been in this room for so long I don’t remember how long I just want to forget” he wrote again days later “I’m writing out my feelings to reassure myself I still exist I fear I’ll be forgotten by the world” “I’m falling apart” he told the AP more recently declining to be named out of fear of retribution He too is being forced to take Chinese traditional medicine he said including liquid from the same unmarked white bottles as the Uighur woman He is also forced to take Lianhua Qingwen a herbal remedy seized regularly by US Customs and Border patrol for violating FDA laws by falsely claiming to be effective against COVID19 Since the start of the outbreak the Chinese government has pushed traditional medicine on its population The remedies are touted by President Xi Jinping China’s nationalist authoritarian leader who has advocated a revival of traditional Chinese culture Although some statebacked doctors say they have conducted trials showing the medicine works against the virus no rigorous clinical data supporting that claim has been published in international scientific journals “None of these medicines have been scientifically proven to be effective and safe” said Fang Shimin a former biochemist and writer known for his investigations of scientific fraud in China who now lives in the United States “It’s unethical to force people sick or healthy to take unproven medicines” When the virus first started spreading thousands flooded pharmacies in Hubei province searching for traditional remedies after state media promoted their effectiveness against the virus Packs of pills were tucked into care packages sent to Chinese workers and students overseas some emblazoned with the Chinese flag others reading “The motherland will forever firmly back you up” But the new measures in Xinjiang forcing some residents to take the medicine is unprecedented experts say The government says that the participation rate in traditional Chinese medicine treatment in the region has “reached 100” according to a state media report When asked about resident complaints that they were being forced to take Chinese medicine one local official said it was being done “according to expert opinion” “We’re helping resolve the problems of ordinary people” said Liu Haijiang the head of Dabancheng district in Urumqi “like getting their children to school delivering them medicine or getting them a doctor” With Xi’s ascent critics of Chinese traditional medicine have fallen silent In April an influential Hubei doctor Yu Xiangdong was removed from a hospital management position for questioning the efficacy of the remedies an acquittance confirmed A government notice online said Yu “openly published inappropriate remarks slandering the nation’s epidemic prevention policy and traditional Chinese medicine” In March the World Health Organization removed guidance on its site saying that herbal remedies were not effective against the virus and could be harmful saying it was “too broad” And in May the Beijing city government announced a draft law that would criminalize speech “defaming or slandering” traditional Chinese medicine Now the government is pushing traditional Chinese remedies as a treatment for COVID19 overseas sending pills and specialists to countries such as Iran Italy and the Philippines Other leaders have also spearheaded unproven and potentially risky remedies – notably US President Donald Trump who stumped for the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine which can cause heart rhythm problems despite no evidence that it’s effective against COVID19 But China appears to be the first to force citizens — at least in Xinjiang — to take them The Chinese government’s push for traditional medicine given free to Xinjiang residents is bolstering the fortunes of billionaires and padding state coffers The family of Wu Yiling the founder of the company that makes Lianhua Qingwen has seen the value of their stake more than double in the past six months netting them over a billion dollars Also profiting the Guangdong government which owns a stake in Wu’s company “It’s a huge waste of money these companies are making millions” said a public health expert who works closely with the Chinese government declining to be identified out of fear of retribution “But then again – why not take it There’s a placebo effect it’s not that harmful Why bother There’s no point in fighting on this” Measures vary widely by city and neighborhood and not all residents are taking the medication The Uighur woman says that despite the threats against her she’s flushing the liquid and pills down the toilet A Han man whose parents are in Xinjiang told the AP that for them the remedies are voluntary Though the measures are “extreme” he says they’re understandable “There’s no other way if the government wants to control this epidemic” he said declining to be named to avoid retribution “We don’t want our outbreak to become like Europe or America”"},

{"7991": "LONDON  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in stable condition with the   Tuesday in a hospital intensive care unit where he was given oxygen but was breathing on his own without a ventilator officials said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has temporarily taken over many of the prime minister’s duties to lead the countrys response to the pandemic while Johnson is being treated Britain has no official post of deputy prime minister The 55yearold Johnson is the first major world leader confirmed to have COVID19 He was admitted to St Thomas Hospital late Sunday with a fever and cough that persisted 10 days after he was diagnosed with the virus and was moved to the ICU on Monday evening after his condition worsened At a news conference Raab said the governments thoughts were with Johnsons family and his fiancee Carrie Symonds who is pregnant and is herself recovering from coronavirus symptoms He is not just the prime minister For all of us in Cabinet he is not just our boss He’s also a colleague and he’s also our friend” Raab said “And I’m confident he’ll pull through because if there’s one thing I know about this prime minister he’s a fighter Johnson was receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any assistance” Raab said adding “He has not required mechanical ventilation or noninvasive respiratory support” No other details were released about what form of oxygen treatment the prime minister was getting The deterioration of Johnson’s   took many in Britain by surprise On Monday afternoon he tweeted that he was in good spirits and thanked the National Health Service for taking care of him and others with the disease St Thomas Hospital is just across the River Thames from Parliament that was one of the first public hospitals in the country to treat COVID19 patients Officials have not said whether Johnson has a private room “It was a shock yesterday to hear the news of his going into intensive care” said Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who is in isolation at home after a family member showed mild coronavirus symptoms “All of us just want him to pull through — he is the leader of our country He is a bighearted generousspirited guy who believes in public service We are rooting for him” The government faced calls Tuesday to be more transparent about Johnsons condition amid concerns it had underplayed how serious it was Its not common for details about the   of British prime ministers to be made public except at times of crisis Even then information has sometimes been scanty When Winston Churchill suffered a debilitating stroke in 1953 the government kept it secret until Churchill recovered Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II was being kept informed about Johnson’s condition Buckingham Palace said the monarch told Johnson and his family “said they were in her thoughts and that she wished the prime minister a full and speedy recovery” The queens son Prince Charles who tested positive for the virus but has recovered and grandson Prince William also sent messages of support Johnson had been quarantined in his Downing Street residence since being diagnosed with COVID19 on March 26 He continued to work throughout his illness to the concern of some of his colleagues With the UK still approaching the peak of the coronavirus outbreak and the government facing criticism it did not act soon enough to put the country into lockdown Johnson and his ministers are under intense pressure Johnson chaired daily meetings on the outbreak until Sunday He released several video messages during his 10 days in isolation urging Britons to stay home and observe social distancing measures to combat the virus Concerns had been growing about Johnson’ ever since he posted a message Friday in which he appeared redeyed and flushed saying he was feeling better though was still feverish Johnsons former communications director Will Walden said the prime minister tended to try to soldier on through illness rather than taking a break “He’s pretty stoic and can be a bit bloodyminded about that kind of thing” Walden told the BBC News that Johnson had been transferred to intensive care drew an outpouring of support from around the world US President Donald Trump said “Americans are all praying for his recovery” “He’s been a really good friend” Trump said at a White House briefing “He’s been really something very special — strong resolute doesn’t quit doesn’t give up” Trump said he asked two “leading companies” to contact officials in London about therapeutics that could be of help He did not identify the companies but said “we have contacted all of Boris’ doctors and we’ll see what’s going to take place but they are ready to go” In response Johnson’s spokesman James Slack said the government was “grateful for all of the warm wishes the prime minister has received” but added that any treatment he receives is a matter for his doctors” French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted his support for Johnson his family and “the British people at this difficult time I wish him well” Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a telegram wishing Johnson a full and quick recovery the Kremlin said “I’m positive that your energy optimism and sense of humor will help combat the disease” Putin wrote The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people but for some especially older adults and the infirm it can cause pneumonia and lead to death The number of coronavirus deaths in the UK has reached 6159 an increase of 786 over 24 hours earlier That is the biggest daily leap to date although the deaths reported Tuesday occurred over several days Britain’s unwritten constitution does not have a clear rule for what happens if a prime minister becomes incapacitated or dies Seven prime ministers have died in office but the most recent was in 1865 Johnson delegating Raab to fill in for him clarifies things for now but it does not mean he would automatically take over permanently should a new leader be needed If it became clear Johnson could not return to his job the remaining Cabinet ministers would be expected to choose a successor The governing Conservative Party would also hold a leadership contest to replace Johnson as party chief — Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at httpapnewscomVirusOutbreak and

Dr Deborah Birx over the weekend advised against residential students  infected with COVID19  isolating off campus Please   Birx said at a news conference Do not return home if youre positive and spread the virus to your family your aunts your uncles your grandparents Birx repeated her warning in a weekly White House call with governors on Tuesday Its really important that you check in with your university presidents to make sure they also have an isolation and care plan for students who become positive even if they have moved to online Birx said in audio obtained by ABC News Its really important that these students are continuously tested isolated and cared for and dont return to their multigenerational households where they could dramatically increase spread particularly over the Labor Day weekend she continued Dr Anthony Fauci the nations top infectious disease expert also weighed in this week On NBCs Today show Wednesday morning he didnt mince words when he said sending students home after an outbreak is the worst thing you could do Keep them at the university in a place thats sequestered enough from the other students but dont have them go home because they could be spreading it in their home state he said In communications with students though some schools are recommending that students go home to isolate or quarantine In materials sent to students who are required to quarantine for 14 days the University of Mississippi encouraged students to consult with your family to consider your options for quarantine including returning to your family residence It also   that options for isolation involve temporary relocation to your family home or a designated isolation space on campus We know that returning home is not advisable for some students if they have a relative who is in a vulnerable group while others prefer to go home if their situation allows for it university spokesman Rod Guajardo told ABC News The University of Mississippi has had nearly 350 confirmed cases of COVID19 among students and employees on its Oxford campus since midAugust when students began to move into the dorms Currently there are 295 active cases  all but nine among students  and 16 active outbreaks are in campus housing according to   posted on the schools website Only 29 students with confirmed cases of COVID19 are currently in designated isolation spaces Some schools have pivoted to virtual learning amid rising cases on campus Last month the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill   after reporting 130 new cases in students in a week To further help dedensify the campus undergraduate students living in campus housing could change their residential plans with no penalty This week James Madison University in Harrisonburg Virginia became one of the latest schools to go virtual President Jonathan Alger announced on Tuesday that learning will be primarily online through at least the end of the month due to a rapid increase in the number of positive cases Since classes started on Aug 24 JMU has had more than 600 confirmed cases with a positivity rate of almost 17 according to   on the schools website The school will consider a potential return to inperson learning as early as Oct 5 later this month Students were asked to return home by Sept 7 in an effort to reduce the number of people on campus Alger said Caitlyn Read a university spokesperson told ABC News the university is not sending students home who have COVID19 and are in isolation or those who have been in contact with a confirmed case and are quarantining until they finish their prescribed time We are also recommending that all students quarantine for 14 days when they return home to help reduce the likelihood of viral spread to new communities Read said JMU students have been encouraged to isolate or quarantine off campus On its website the school stated that students that live both on and off campus are being asked to return home to their families if possible to isolate andor quarantine The school currently has 601 active COVID19 cases with 89 students in isolation or quarantine beds on campus Space may be at a premium for schools isolating or quarantining students One reason for going remote Alger said is the worry that space may run out With 143 isolation and quarantine beds total there were 54 available as of Wednesday In addition to monitoring   trends over the next four weeks the university will be looking into acquiring additional capacity should they need it in the future Read said The University of Mississippi also is exploring acquiring more space for isolating and quarantining students including local hotels and apartment complexes off campus Its current isolation capacity is at nearly 75 The numbers are fluctuating up and down every day so our goal is to track and analyze the data available to us and then make decisions to help our students however we can Guajardo said The difficulties that come with isolating and quarantining students  especially those from states on New Yorks quarantine travel list  led to Columbia Universitys decision to go virtual this fall In a   last month President Lee C Bollinger noted that while I have no doubt that we could ensure a safe quarantine period from a public health standpoint two weeks is a long time to endure isolation especially for students who will be leaving home for the first time Conditions for all students in quarantine will be austere to say the least he added"},

top   officials warned the death toll from COVID19 could reach 200000 even with mitigation efforts President   has abruptly changed his messaging and extended the White House coronavirus guidelines through the month of April While last week he stressed a need for Americans to get back to work and said   packed churches on Easter the president now says the COVID19 death toll will peak around the holiday and signaled normalcy may not return until June 1 or later In an abrupt shift from his messaging last week that downplayed the impact of the novel coronavirus and urged Americans to return to work President Donald Trump opened his daily briefing Tuesday saying the extension of the White House social distancing guidelines through April represents a matter of life and death In a few moments Dr Birx will explain the data that form the basis for our decision to extend the guidelines and Dr Fauci will explain why its absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines for the next 30 days the president said Its a matter of life and death frankly Trump predicted as things get better its going to be like a burst of light but acknowledged the next few weeks will be painful Hopefully as the experts are predicting a lot of us are predicting having studied it so hard going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel but this is going to be a very painful two weeks Trump said appearing to refer to the peak of the death toll which some models have signaled will hit midApril Trump who grew up near Elmhurst Hospital got quiet and solemn as he described watching doctors and nurses heading into work at the Queens hospital that has been one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis It was the most emotion Trump has shown during the daily briefings given at the White House and marked a clear change in tone I watched as doctors and nurses went into a certain hospital in Elmhurst this morning I know Elmhurst  Queens that’s  I grew up right next to it I know the hospital very well Ive been seeing it all my life my young life the president said He described seeing the scenes of truck trailers that are being used as freezers for bodies of patients who have died from coronavirus And I watched the doctors and the nurses walking into that hospital this morning Its like military people going into battle going into war The bravery is incredible And I just have to take my hat  I would take my hat  if I were wearing a hat Id rip that hat off so fast and I would say you people are just incredible They really are They’re very brave the president said Dr Deborah Birx the White Houses coronavirus response coordinator utilizing a slideshow and flanked by visual models then explained what drove the White House’s decision to extend the guidelines Introducing studies from the University and Washington and London Imperial College Birx said their models showed what social distancing would do what would happen if people stayed home what would happen if people were careful every day to wash their hands and worry about touching their faces  what an extraordinary thing this could be if every American followed these Birx emphasized that without mitigation efforts between 15 million and 22 million people in the US would die Even with social distancing models show 100 to 200000 deaths which is still way too much Birx acknowledged I know its stressful to follow the guidelines but it is more stressful and more difficult to the soldiers on the front line she added Theres no magic bullet there’s no magic vaccine or therapy its just behaviors Birx said Each of our behaviors translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days Dr Anthony Fauci the nations top infectious disease expert and a key member of the coronavirus task force urged Americans not to take their foot off the accelerator with regards to mitigation efforts like social distancing and staying home This is tough People are suffering people are dying Its inconvenient from a societal standpoint from an economic standpoint to go through this but this is going to be the answer to our problems Fauci said The 15 days that we had of mitigation clearly have had in effect although its tough to quantitate it Fauci said urging people that its more important than ever to keep it up rather than let their guard down The reason we feel so strongly about the necessity of the additional 30 days is that now is the time  not to take your foot off the accelerator  but to just press it down on the accelerator Fauci said Fauci said they have seen inklings of fewer cases per day in New York but said Americans should brace themselves to continue to see deaths rise because of the timeline of the virus and know that mitigation efforts are still working So what we are going to see and thats why we have to brace ourselves in the next several days to a week or so were going to continue to see things go up We cannot be discouraged by that because the mitigation is actually working and will work he said Asked if Americans should be prepared for 100000 Americans to die from COVID19 Fauci said pointblank The answer is yes As sobering a number as that is we should be prepared for it Fauci continued Is it going to be that much I hope not And I think the more we push on the mitigation the less likelihood it would be that number  but being realistic we need to prepare ourselves that that is a possibility that that is what we will see We gotta brace ourselves in the next several days to a week or so were going to continue to see things go up We cannot be discouraged by that Because the mitigation is actually working and will work he said Trump said it was very sobering to see that 100000 was the predicted minimum death toll but said that it is still a very low number A hundred thousand is according to modeling a very low number I asked this a while ago they said ‘its unlikely you will be able to attain that’  I think we are doing better than that the president said emphasizing that 22 million people could’ve died if the US did ride it out without mitigation efforts On wearing masks Trump said if people want to do it theres certainly no harm to it before suggesting people use a scarf so that medical masks can go to hospitals Trump also said the federal government is distributing 10000 ventilators key life saving devices in the fight against coronavirus that many states have said they need while acknowledging that the surge is coming We have almost 10000 ventilators that we have ready to go We have to hold them back because the surge is coming and its coming pretty strong Trump said adding that ventilators are going to Michigan Louisiana New York and New Jersey Patients who are hardest hit by coronavirus end up in Intensive Care Units on ventilators to allow them to breathe and states with hot spots have warned that if they dont have enough they risk facing a situation where they have to choose who lives and who dies Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the top health expert on the coronavirus task force says the recommendation of masks for all Americans is under very active consideration Fauci told CNN this morning that the issue of facial coverings will be discussed at the task force meeting today but that the determination could only come when we have enough for health care workers The idea of getting a much more broad communitywide use of masks outside of the health care setting is under very active discussion at the task force The CDC group is looking at that very carefully Fauci said The thing that has inhibited that a bit is to make sure we dont take away the supply of masks from the health care workers who need them But when we get in a situation where we have enough masks I believe there will be some very serious consideration about more broadening this recommendation of using masks Were not there yet but I think were close to coming to some determination Fauci added If in fact a person who may or may not be infected wants to prevent infecting somebody else one of the best ways to do that is with a mask so perhaps thats the best way to go Fauci told CNN Thats under very active consideration Well be discussing it today this afternoon at the task force meeting His comments follow   in the Washington Post that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering recommending general public wear face coverings for all Americans in public after initially telling Americans theyre only recommended for health care workers Hospitals across the country have sounded alarms in recent weeks that they lack the personal protective equipment like masks to treat COVID19 patients Asked Monday about the potential for all Americans to start wearing masks President Trump said it’s something he and the task force could discuss for the shortterm We havent discussed it to that extent but its certainly something we could discuss Trump said We’re not going to be wearing masks forever but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear Fauci also said the data is starting to show glimmers that social distancing is taking an effect If you look now we are starting to see glimmers that that is actually having some dampening effect he said of mitigation efforts We hope and I believe it will happen that we may start seeing a turnaround but we havent seen it yet Tom Inglesby director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security called on the CDC Sunday to make the recommendation for mask use widespread in an effort to slow the spread Its critical that all medical masks N95 surgical procedural be given to health care workers and emergency personnel Inglesby said in a Twitter thread But members of the general public should wear nonmedical fabric face masks when going out in public in one additional societal effort to slow the spread of the virus down He pointed to South Korea China and other countries where outbreaks appear managed and face masks are widely used in public While Inglesby also suggested people might make their own masks at home using washable materials other officials have cautioned for weeks that if a mask isnt fitted correctly it wont be effective House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday that the priorities for the next COVID19 relief package should include more protections for front line health care workers with an added infrastructure element to boost the nation’s water systems and broadband capabilities We have agreed in our negotiations that everything that were doing is specific to the coronavirus challenge Pelosi said on MSNBCs Morning Joe And that would be infrastructure for water systems are so essential Broadband because so many people are relying on telecommunication and social media and the rest But I do think that weve acted in bipartisan ways every step of the way and we will continue to do so We may have our differences but we have to find our common ground she added Pelosi who last week instructed her committees to begin coming up with proposals for the next relief bill said on Monday that it is likely the next bill won’t get a vote until mid to late April as the House is not scheduled to return until at least April 20th and she has ruled of the possibility of remote voting I would not suspect that we would have any bipartisan legislation before we return after Easter and Passover But we’re getting ready  and in some cases we are ready Pelosi said on a call with reporters She also said she wants to see an increase in aid for states and include another round of direct cash payments in the next package Following Pelosi’s interview this morning President Trump took to Twitter to make some snide remarks at the Speaker saying he tuned in to see what moves she was planning to further hurt our Country  even after he has called on others to put partisanship politics aside The president and the speaker haven’t spoken since October Trump later weighed in from the White House on phase four tweeting that this is the time for Congress to pass an infrastructure bill since interest rates are low Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell meanwhile signaled hes not ready to begin talks on a fourth relief package I think we need to wait a few days here a few weeks and see how things are working out McConnell said this morning on The Hugh Hewitt Show I’m not going to allow this to be an opportunity for the Democrats to achieve unrelated policy items that they would not otherwise be able to pass he added During a briefing at the State Department a now weekly occurrence with fewer reporters allowed in the room amid social distancing guidelines Secretary of State Pompeo did not use the term Wuhan virus as he consistently has for a month now signaling a slight softening of position towards China When asked about disinformation from other countries Pompeo did not call out China but instead talked broadly about the need to trust data from all countries This is the reason disinformation is dangerous Its not because its bad politics its because it puts lives at risk if we dont have confidence in the information thats coming from every country So I would urge every nation Do you best to collect the data and do your best to share that information he said Asked later whether the US trusts the data coming from China Pompeo deflected the question to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the department of Health and Human Services  even after openly questioning their data last week When President Trump was questioned about China and other countries engaging in disinformation campaigns on Fox News Channel’s Fox and Friends Monday he said They do it we do it We call them different things and I make statements that are very strong against China including the Chinese Virus Trump said after vowing last week to stop using the term denounced by the World Health Organization Every country does it but they build it up and we handle that and they probably handle it but countries do that US Army Lt Gen Todd Semonite the commanding general of the Army Corps of Engineers spearheading an effort to build makeshift hospitals in response to the coronavirus crisis said the scope of the initiative is immense Were looking right now at around 341 different facilities across all of the United States very similar to the Javits Center Semonite told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos Tuesday on Good Morning America Weve got eight contracts under gear right now people in centers constructing facilities probably about 8500 beds Semonite said By the end of the day we should have another five contracts awarded with somewhere around another 4000 beds Semonite said theyre looking at hotels and dormitories as well as large open spaces like convention centers as potential sites Some will house COVID19 patients and some that will treat all other patients Our thought was to make it extremely simple he added Find an existing facility that already has all the codes has heat has water has IT has parking lots and then just put in whatever we can like a hospital inside of that The Army Corps of Engineers is working in lockstep with the Federal Emergency Management Agency the Department of Health and Human Services as well as local governments Semonite said"},
{"8161": "WASHINGTON  In a surprise move the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a sizable halfpercentage point Tuesday in an effort to support the economy in the face of the spreading   Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference that the virus “will surely weigh on economic activity both here and abroad for some time” It was the Feds first move since last year when it reduced its key shortterm rate three times Its also the first time its cut rates between policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis and it is the largest rate cut since then The Dow Jones Industrial Average which had been down as much as 356 points shortly before the Feds announcement initially jumped on the news The surge was shortlived By late afternoon the Dow had tumbled more than 600 points in a sign of nagging worries about economic damage from the virus Still on Monday the Dow had rocketed up nearly 1300 points — its largest percentage gain since 2009 The yield on the 10year Treasury note briefly fell below 1 for the first time ever Investors around the world bid up bond prices — which move in the opposite direction of yields — as they sought safety from the  s turmoil The fear that coursed through financial markets after the Feds announcement underscored the worry that there are limitations to what the Fed and other central banks can do to resolve a crisis of this kind Powell acknowledged as much when he observed that the “ultimate solution to this challenge will come from others most notably health professionals Indeed the Feds announcement of a steep rate cut signaled its concern that the coronavirus which is depressing economic activity across the world poses an escalating threat and could trigger a recession Rising uncertainty about how and when the threat will be resolved is pressuring markets Powell said that since last week when several Fed officials had said they saw no urgent need to cut rates “we have seen a broader spread of the virus “So we saw a risk to the economy and we chose to act” he added At the same time Powell sought to balance those concerns by noting that US economy remained sturdy with unemployment low and consumer spending solid “The economy continues to perform well he said “We will get to the other side of this” The Feds statement announcing its rate cut said it would “act as appropriate to support the economy” which economists saw as a sign its leaning toward an additional rate cut perhaps at its next policy meeting in two weeks Emergency cuts like Tuesdays have typically been followed by further reductions soon afterward Tuesdays move which the Feds policy committee backed unanimously lowered its benchmark rate to a range of 1 to 125 On Tuesday Australia’s central bank announced that it was cutting its official rate by a quarterpoint to a record low of 05 and cited the coronavirus’ “significant effect” on the economy as the reason Just as in Australia central banks in Japan and Europe have almost no more room to provide stimulus through rate cuts because their benchmark rates are at or near zero — or even below The result is that pressure is rising on governments across the world to supply economic help through tax or spending policies China has taken action on several fronts to ease credit and stabilize the worlds secondlargest economy in the face of the coronavirus Members of the US Congress are finalizing a 75 billion emergency bill to fund the governments response to the coronavirus outbreak in a rare act of bipartisan cooperation The legislation would speed development of a coronavirus vaccine pay for preparedness by states and localities help other countries fight the outbreak and seek to ensure that the vaccine is affordable when its ready though that could take a year Powell acknowledged that there are limits to the Fed’s influence to deal with the economic repercussions of the virus — from closed factories to canceled business travel to disrupted company supply chains But he said lower rates can help keep credit flowing particularly to struggling businesses already laden with debt that would otherwise face higher borrowing costs And he suggested that the Feds intervention would boost consumer and business confidence and provide “a meaningful boost to the economy” Many economists do see some benefit from the Feds move “The Fed obviously cannot address the virus itself by cutting rates but they can hope to shortcircuit the potential for a negative response in financial markets that could make the economic impact of the virus even worse” said Eric Winograd senior economist at AB Across the world         business is slowing  and in some places stopping altogether as a consequence of the virus Factories in China have been struggling to grind slowly back to life Many European vacation destinations have been all but deserted as leisure and corporate travel has diminished And major companies around the world bracing for the risk that the economic landscape could worsen before it improves Indeed Powell noted that “you are hearing concerns from people in the travel business the hotel business and things like that” We expect that will continue and probably will grow” he said Google told its 8000 fulltime staffers and contractors at its European headquarters in Dublin to work from home Tuesday Irish news reports have said that a Google staffer is being tested for coronavirus But the company issued only a brief statement that said it was continuing to take precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of its workforce President Donald Trump who has repeatedly attacked the Fed and Powell in particular for not cutting rates more aggressively doubled down in a new tweet after the Feds announcement saying         “More easing and cutting” Powell said the central bank is focused on its goal of supporting the economy and said We’re never going to consider any political considerations whatsoever” Earlier Tuesday seven major economies had pledged to use “all appropriate tools to deal with the spreading coronavirus but announced no immediate actions The group of major industrial countries referred to as the G7 said it was “ready to take actions including fiscal measures where appropriate to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy” The joint statement from the United States Japan Germany Britain France Italy and Canada followed an emergency conference call among the finance ministers and central bank presidents led by Powell and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin The G7 has issued similar joint statements during periods of extreme market turmoil such as the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis Last week the Dow plunged 14 from recent highs its worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis Global agencies have indicated this week that there will be a significant economic impact as the virus spreads On Monday the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said that the coronavirus which was first detected in China but has now spread to 60 nations in Europe the US Latin America and other parts of Asia could cause the world economy to shrink this quarter for the first time since the international financial crisis more than a decade ago The OECD lowered its forecasts for global growth in 2020 by half a percentage point to 24 — and said the figure could go as low as 15 if the outbreak is sustained and widespread There are signs that the outbreak has begun to ebb in China"},

exaggerated his own record on the economy A look at some of the past weeks rhetoric and the facts ON BIDENHARRIS TRUMP “If Biden would win  he’s going to double and triple everybody’s  ” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS Trump is exaggerating Wildly so Biden would raise taxes primarily on the wealthy But a July estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget finds that the increase is a small fraction of what Trump claimed The former vice president’s plan would raise “taxes for the top 1 percent of earners by 13 to 18 of aftertax income while indirectly increasing taxes for most other groups by 02 to 06” the nonpartisan group said To put that in perspective tax collections would increase by 34 trillion to 37 trillion over the next decade That is a lot of money But it’s not a doubling or tripling The government is on pace to collect 47 trillion over the next decade so the Biden plan would be roughly be a 78 increase in revenues ——— TRUMP asked about social media

would have assumed that the Democrats would have checked that out” — news conference Thursday TRUMP asked about the subject again “I have nothing to do with it I read something about it” Trump said Saturday during a news conference He added “It’s not something that bothers me  It’s not something that we will be pursuing” Asked point blank if Harris is eligible Trump replied “I just told you I have not got into it in great detail” — news conference Saturday THE FACTS Harris a senator from California is without question eligible Harris 55 was born in Oakland California making her a naturalborn US citizen and eligible to be president if Biden were unable to serve a full term Her father an economist from Jamaica and her mother a cancer researcher from India met at the University of California Berkeley as graduate students The Constitution requires a vice president to meet the eligibility requirements to be president That includes being a naturalborn US citizen at least 35 years old and a resident in the US for at least 14 years “I can’t believe people are making this idiotic comment” Laurence Tribe a Harvard University professor of constitutional law told The Associated Press in 2019 when similar false claims emerged about Harris during her presidential run “She is a natural born citizen and there is no question about her eligibility to run” Tribe said Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket Trump in past years indulged in the false conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born

She never called Biden a racist Pierson appears to be referring to Harris remarks during a Democratic primary debate in Miami in June 2019 when the California senator         challenged Bidens record of opposing busing as a way to integrate schools in the 1970s Harris prefaced her criticism by telling Biden at that time “I do not believe you are a racist I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground” She then went on “It was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country It was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools Harris said She was bused to school every day That little girl was me” It was a breakthrough moment for Harris at the candidates’ first debate stunning Biden who responded that “he did not praise racists” and provided a         hairsplitting defense of his position on busing But she did not accuse him of being racist ——— SOCIAL SECURITY TRUMP “At the end of the year the assumption that I win I’m going to terminate the payroll tax  We’ll be paying into Social Security through the general fund” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS Under Trump’s proposal Social Security would lose its dedicated funding source Payroll taxes raise about 1 trillion annually for Social Security and the president was unconcerned about the loss of those revenues Trump campaign officials stressed that the general fund consists of assets and liabilities that finance government operations and could do so for Social Security The general fund is nicknamed “America’s Checkbook” on the Treasury Department’s website The risk is that the loss of a dedicated funding source could destabilize an antipoverty program that provides payments to roughly 65 million Americans It also could force people to cut back on the spending that drives growth so they can save for their own retirement and health care needs if they believe the government backstop is in jeopardy A 124 payroll tax split between employers and workers funds Social Security while a 29 payroll tax finances Medicare The Social Security tax raised roughly 1 trillion last year according to government figures Over a 10year period Trump’s idea

to make the payroll tax deferrals permanent But Trump clearly said that he would eliminate the payroll tax four times at his Wednesday press briefing and even answered a question about “permanently” rescinding it ——— TRUMP asked how the general fund can sustain the payments “We’re going to have tremendous growth  You will see growth like you have not seen in a long time” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS It is highly unlikely that economic growth would be enough to offset the loss of the payroll tax Trump has a record of making wildly improbable growth projections He suggested that his 2017 income tax cuts would propel economic growth as high as 6 annually That never happened Growth reached 3 in 2018 then slumped to 22 and the US economy crumbled into recession this year because of the coronavirus ——— VIRUS THREAT TRUMP on COVID19 “Nobody understood it because nobody has ever seen anything like this The closest thing is in 1917 they say — right The great — the great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing where they lost anywhere from 50 to 100 million people Probably ended the Second World War all the soldiers were sick” — news briefing Monday THE FACTS He got the year wrong for the Spanish flu as he routinely does and may have overstated deaths from it The pandemic spread from early 1918 to late 1920 It killed an estimated 50 million worldwide with about 675000 of the deaths in the US according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention That pandemic did not end World War II which came two decades later ——— TRUMP “We’re still in the pandemic which will be going away as I say it will be going away And they scream how you can you say that I said because it’s going to be going away” — interview Thursday on Fox Business Network THE FACTS No matter how many times he says it the virus is not going to just magically disappear The virus is now blamed for more than 166000 deaths and more than 52 million confirmed infections in the US — easily the highest totals in the world In the past week the average number of new cases per day was on the rise in eight states and deaths per day were climbing in 26 according to an Associated Press analysis Dr Anthony Fauci the governments top infectious diseases official has warned that increased cases across the South and West in particular put the entire country at risk On Thursday for instance the rate of positive virus cases in Texas soared to the highest levels of the pandemic with nearly 1 in every 4 coronavirus tests coming back positive Nevada had its biggest daily jump in coronavirus fatalities to date In February Trump asserted coronavirus cases were going “very substantially down not up” and said it will be fine because “in April supposedly it dies with the hotter weather” Fauci says there “certainly” will be coronavirus infections in the fall and winter ——— TRUMP on whether he still thinks kids are essentially immune from COVID19 “Yeah I think that for the most part they do very well I mean they — they don’t get very sick They don’t catch it easily” — news briefing Tuesday THE FACTS They aren’t immune and he ignores racial disparities among those kids who get infected Although it’s true that children are less likely than adults to develop COVID19 the CDC has nevertheless counted more than 250000 infections by the virus in Americans younger than 18 or roughly 7 of all cases Racial disparities in the US outbreak also extend to children with Hispanic and Black children with COVID19 more likely to be hospitalized than white kids The total number of kids who have been infected but not confirmed is almost certainly far higher than the CDC figures experts say because those with mild or no symptoms are less likely to get tested Trump also glosses over the fact that kids can spread disease without showing symptoms themselves The CDC in May also warned doctors to be on the lookout for a rare but lifethreatening inflammatory reaction in some children who’ve had the coronavirus The condition had been reported in more than 100 children in New York and in some kids in several other states and in Europe with some deaths Two recent government reports laid bare the racial disparities One of the CDC reports looked at children with COVID19 who needed hospitalization Hispanic children were hospitalized at a rate eight times higher than white kids and Black children were hospitalized at a rate five times higher it found The second report examined cases of the rare virusassociated syndrome in kids It found that nearly threequarters of the children with the syndrome were either Hispanic or Black well above their representation in the general population ——— ECONOMY TRUMP “The manufacturing sector is booming and the production index is at the highest reading since October of 18 which was an extraordinary period of time” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS The pandemic crushed US factories and the damage persists There is no boom Even after three months of job gains the US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the manufacturing sector has 740000 fewer jobs than before the outbreak All the factory hiring gains under Trump have disappeared There were 257000 more manufacturing jobs on the day Trump became president than now More important the jobs recovery has shown signs of stalling Just 26000 factory jobs were added in July down from 357000 added jobs in June The sector has been recovering Yet after increases in production in June the Federal Reserve said US factory output was running 111 below prepandemic levels Trump cited one component of an index composed by the Institute for Supply Management that indicates factory production grew in July as well It was the best reading since August of 2018 not October as claimed by the president But that same report showed that manufacturers are also cutting back on employment suggesting that a boom has yet to begin ——— TRUMP on tariffs on China “We’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars from China We never took 10 cents from China never  not even 10 cents” — news conference Monday THE FACTS It’s false to say the US never collected a dime in tariffs on Chinese goods before he took action They are simply higher in some cases than they were before It’s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by China Tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from US businesses and consumers not from China Tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically ——— MAIL VOTING TRUMP Universal mailin voting is “a system riddled by fraud and corruption” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS Voting fraud actually is very rare The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 000004 to 00009 based on studies of past elections Five states relied on mailin ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person “Trump is simply wrong about mailin balloting raising a ‘tremendous’ potential for fraud” Richard L Hasen an elections expert at the University of California Irvine School of Law wrote recently “While certain pockets of the country have seen their share of absenteeballot scandals problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on votebymail including the heavily Republican state of Utah” ——— NEW YORK VOTING TRUMP “You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race They should do that race over by the way  When you look at the ballot the ballots that are missing and the ballot frauds — nobody knows what’s going on with that race and yet they declared her a winner” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS There’s no evidence of fraud in the Democratic congressional primary in New York City that was won by Democratic Rep Carolyn Maloney Nor did Trump offer any proof of fraud New York State decided to allow anyone to vote by mail in the June primary because of the pandemic More than 400000 people voted by absentee ballot in New York City a figure that was 10 times the number of absentee ballots cast in the 2016 primary Opening and counting those ballots by elections officials took weeks leading to a legal dispute over nonfraud issues such as missing postmarks Candidates observing the count say that thousands of ballots were disqualified because of technical errors voters wouldn’t have encountered if they had voted in person like problems with their signature New York City’s Board of Elections ultimately certified the results six weeks after the election ——— Associated Press writers Amanda Seitz in Chicago and Lauran Neergaard Aamer Madhani and

{"4937": "WASHINGTON  For the millions of Americans living under some form of lockdown to curb the spread of the   not knowing when the restrictions will end is a major source of anxiety Will life events — weddings funerals even just simple nights out with friends — be delayed for a few weeks a few months or much longer President Donald Trump gave one answer this week saying he hoped businesses would reopen by Easter on April 12 citing the severe damage restrictions have done to the economy Most public health experts however caution that it would be reckless to lift restrictions before COVID19 infections have peaked and begun to ebb — unleashing a second wave of cases that could be just as damaging to the economy Scientists are reluctant to predict exactly when restrictions could be safely loosened but based on what theyve observed in China — the first country struck by the new virus — some relief could come approximately six to eight weeks after lockdowns are implemented That is based on the assumption that cases could peak two or three weeks after lockdowns begin and gradually decline for the next two or three weeks While we may yearn for a clear timeline for when life will return to normal scientists say that isnt exactly the right question Routines wont resume exactly as they were for several months or longer – but that doesnt mean well all be stuck in total lockdowns until then “We can’t simply wait inside for two years for a COVID19 vaccine to be developed said Stephen Morse a disease researcher at Columbia University “We have to find some way to return to normal life” Decisions on how and when to lift restrictions he added should be based on information about infection rates that can only be learned by increasing testing That will allow policymakers to tailor restrictions to fit the outbreak in different areas Rather than imagining the lockdown as having an onoff switch – where the only choice is between completely shutting down the country or throwing all rules out the window — many scientists advocate for charting a course in between where restrictions can be ramped up or down Imagine that the lockdown has a volume dial that can be twisted up or down “With more information we can target our responses to be the most impactful” said Nadia Abuelezam a disease researcher at Boston College That might mean introducing people back into the workforce in stages she suggested Scientists are closely watching what happens in other countries that were struck earlier by the coronavirus to see what happens when those places loosen restrictions Restaurants and offices have begun to reopen in many Chinese cities about two months after the country began to lock down There are still restrictions in place — such as limits in how many people can occupy an elevator or a conference room — and widespread testing for the disease continues A second outbreak could prompt future clampdowns “People should be prepared for the fact that we are not going back to completely normal life for a while” said Mark Jit a disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine “But we also need to allow people to see the light at end of the tunnel” The metaphorical dial of restrictions could be set in different positions depending on what expanded testing reveals about how many people in an area are currently infected — and how many have recovered from past infections The goal would be to allow people to partially return to their daily routines while limiting the chances of new infections The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms in many people but even if only a fraction of cases are severe enough to require hospitalization — between 14 and 20 — the sheer scale of the epidemic puts enormous strain on hospitals health care workers and other patients who may see unrelated procedures delayed On Thursday came a grim milestone and reminder that the United States has not begun to flatten the curve of the epidemic The total number of confirmed infections — more than 83000 according to Johns Hopkins University — surpassed Chinas toll The White House is now considering a datadriven approach In a letter Thursday to Americas governors — who have largely been the ones implementing the restrictions in the US — Trump said that his administration was planning to expand “robust surveillance testing which allows us to monitor the spread of the virus throughout the country The information would be used to “suggest guidelines categorizing counties as highrisk mediumrisk or lowrisk the letter said Dr Anthony Fauci the governments top infectious disease expert and White House adviser Dr Deborah Birx have recently outlined the approach in media briefings and interviews What we are trying to do is utilize a laserfocused approach Birx said at Thursday’s White House briefing While few details are available this approach seems to differ from other countries that have focused on identifying and isolating infected individuals and their close contacts In South Korea which managed to curb an early outbreak without fully shutting all businesses and schools widespread testing allows health workers to find infected people and aggressively track down people they came into contact with — thus allowing them to contain the spread of infection For the US to learn from this example or adopt a similar approach the first step is more widespread testing said Elizabeth Halloran a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle In addition to tests that check whether people are currently infected experts are also honing tests to detect whether someone has had the disease in the past Scientists expect that people who have recovered from COVID19 will have some immunity to it though they aren’t sure for how long This information could better inform decisions Perhaps people with immunity could be among the first to return to work — or maybe the data would reveal what locations or behaviors are the riskiest for disease spread said Abuelezam Before relaxing socialdistancing restrictions there will also need to be ample supply of protective gear for health care workers said Halloran Shortages of masks and other supplies have put them in jeopardy and threatened to slow or halt their work There are no easy answers but scientists say its misleading to imagine a choice between public health and jobs “If you don’t do enough about the virus you’re going to get steamrolled by it — which would also steamroll the economy” said Jeffrey Shaman a data scientist at

tests coming back positive for the virus Alabama is the only state in the region where all three numbers rising Mississippis deaths are up but positive rates and cases are dropping In Florida where reported deaths from COVID19 are running at about 114 a day on average down from a peak of 185 in early August Gov Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday that he is easing the states 5monthold ban on visitors to nursing homes “Part of having a healthy society is understanding that human beings seek affection” DeSantis said his voice cracking at times as he wondered aloud whether his actions had contributed to the suffering by separating the elderly from their loved ones He paused for about 20 seconds to collect himself The governor also said the number of people in Florida hospitals with COVID19 is down nearly 60 from its peak in July and that newly confirmed cases on Monday dropped below 2000 the lowest daily total since midJune The US leads the world in coronavirus deaths and confirmed infections after a spring outbreak centered around New York followed by the summer flareup across the Sun Belt As of Tuesday there were more than 253 million confirmed cases and over 850000 deaths worldwide

{"2845": "WASHINGTON  Toplevel negotiations between Congress and the White House are pushing toward resolution on a ballooning 1 trillionplus economic rescue package as President   urged a deal to steady a nation shuttered by the         coronavirus pandemic With a population on edge and financial markets teetering all sides indicated late Saturday that a deal is within reach At issue is how best to keep paychecks flowing for millions of workers abruptly sidelined by the crisis Talks also narrowed on a socalled Marshall Plan for hospitals as well as industry loans to airlines and others all but grounded by the virus outbreak and         national shutdown The postWorld War II Marshall Plan helped to rebuild Western Europe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced late Saturday all sides were “very close” to a bipartisan resolution McConnell instructed committee chairmen to assemble draft legislation Officials put the price tag at nearly 14 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve it could pump 2 trillion into the US economy “We are poised to deliver the significant relief that Americans need with the speed that this crisis demands” McConnell said Talks will resume Sunday morning when the top four congressional leaders of both parties are set to confer privately at the Capitol with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in hopes of striking a final accord A spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said there is “not yet an agreement” Spokesman Justin Goodman said Democrats look forward to reading the draft and further negotiations “Everybodys working hard and they want to get to a solution thats the right solution I think were very close Trump said at Saturdays briefing striking a confident tone about the nations

Senate passage on Monday The urgency to act is mounting as          jobless claims skyrocket businesses shutter and the financial markets are set to reopen Monday eager for signs that Washington can soften the blow of the healthcare crisis and what experts say is a looming recession Trump has largely stayed out of the details but said Saturday that he would be lobbying the lead negotiators On one topic Trump appears to be agreeing with Democrats as Washington tries to steer clear of the politically toxic bailouts from the last economic crises Trump expressed a clear distaste for any industry including the airlines that would use federal assistance to buy back its own stock in an effort to increase profits Banning stock buybacks is one of Democrats’ top business priorities in the emerging package Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other top White House officials were on Capitol Hill for a second day of nonstop negotiations But no announcement was expected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who has been in talks with Mnuchin returned to Washington on Saturday and was scheduled to join Sundays meeting Negotiations are focused on providing direct relief to Americans with onetime checks of 1200 as well as ongoing payroll support and enhanced unemployment benefits for the newly out of work Talks are also focused on loans to airlines and other industries blindsided by the crisis as well as possible aid to the states and billions for hospitals and healthcare providers on the front lines of the outbreak The emerging package builds on a GOP proposal but Democrats push for addons including food security aid small business loans and other measures for workers “Were making very good progress” Schumer said late Saturday “Were going to continue working though the night” On Saturday Trump opened the daily virus briefing with a roll call of his administrations accomplishments a weekinreview meant to rebut criticism that the White House was moving too slowly to combat the crisis The president pushed back against accusations that he was sluggish to act for fear of upsetting China though he told aides last month that he had not wanted to alienate Beijing by criticizing its secretive handling of the initial outbreak Trump did not lose his temper as he did the day before But mixed vague messaging still ruled the briefing For example as hospitals across the nation report a dire shortage of supplies to care for an expected surge of patients Vice President Mike Pence said the government was completing a halfbilliondollar order for masks But none of the government officials at the briefing could suggest when the masks would reach medical facilities a moment of confusion that caused Trump to grow visibly frustrated Dr Anthony Fauci the governments top infectious

still hammering out whether there will be money to the states whose governors have requested billions as well as how much will be going to hospitals and healthcare providers Trump acknowledged the

{"6011": "Strict social distancing measures and eventually maskwearing were seen as lifesaving tools early on in the coronavirus pandemic as it tore through the Northeast and officials came to fear the worst But as daily caseloads and death rates began to fall in the spring many states in the South and West pushed hard to reopen egged on by President Trump despite not meeting White House guidelines for doing so Now states such as Texas and Florida have had to make a drastic aboutface in recent weeks as   cases and deaths there jumped dramatically As some of the earliest locations to end their stayathome orders local leaders and more recently governors in those states have had to reverse course shutting down bars and restaurants and in some cases mandating face coverings Those moves have precipitated uneven compliance and even acts of defiance from businesses residents and officials alike in the politically charged atmosphere such as bars in Mississippi staying open and residents in Florida without face coverings there is no statewide requirement But experts and local officials say it is possible to put the genie back in the bottle and get populations to comply  thanks to peer pressure and enforcement even if it is late compared to other states Beth Redbird an assistant professor of sociology at Northwestern University who runs the schools ongoing   said the pandemic  once largely centered in New York  has started to hit close to home for Americans living in these states sickening and killing loved ones and overwhelming hospitals I think by and large people are more worried she told ABC News Redbird and other experts said that while these grim circumstances will help communities accept stricter COVID19 regulations they warned that local state and federal leaders need to come together with succinct plans and messaging if they want to see any progress Texas has seen 168008 new coronavirus cases since Gov Greg Abbott began reopening the economy on April 30 an average of 2400 cases a day according to   on July 9 During that same period the state saw 1270 new COVID19 related deaths an average of about 18 deaths a day the   department said Between July 7 and 9 the state recorded 29789 cases a threeday average of nearly 10000 and 263 deaths a threeday average of  88 the health department said In June Abbott told reporters the rising numbers were concerning but said   declining requests from mayors to mandate a facecovering order statewide However as the cases rose Abbott changed his stance At the end of June he ordered all bars to close and on July 2 he ordered that counties mandate face coverings if theyve seen more than 20 positive cases in a day The only strategy we have to prevent that from happening is by everybody wearing a mask Abbott said at a news conference on July 9 Several Texas sheriffs and law enforcement leaders have been vocal against the governors mandate and have said through their social media pages they wont enforce the fines for violating Abbotts order Houston Police Officers Union president Joe Gamaldi called the order draconian in   which has been liked by over 160 users as of July 10 Everyone needs to wear a mask but dont put us in this position he tweeted There have been several protests against the governor from residents and business owners over his orders Redbird said political backtracking normally hurts the publics trust in elected officials and some people wont heed their policy or warnings However the pandemics effects are too hard to ignore and based on her studies more people are taking precautions seriously About 75 of the Northwestern Social Change Surveys respondents   and the response increased between March and April The data has corresponded to the rise in respondents who said they knew someone who contracted the disease according to the survey Knowing someone who gets sick will be more impactful than your governor saying OK you have to do this Redbird said Redbird added that organizations and businesses are beginning to take the precautions into their own hands by mandating face coverings and limiting people regardless of what the government says That kind of peer pressure has led to more compliance she said Jeff Shaman a professor of environmental health science at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health said one of the biggest roadblocks in fighting the pandemic has been the lack of a consistent message from all levels of government For example while President Trump has been pushing for more businesses and schools to reopen leaders in states like Michigan New York and cities like Miami seeing the COVID cases rise have been ignoring his calls and sticking to their slower economic reopenings plans to limit inperson classes and strict health orders What needs to be out there is a national dialogue Shaman told ABC News At the same time experts say that the recent health orders implemented by state and local leaders are better late than never Mark McClellan the director of the DukeMargolis Center for Health Policy told ABC News strong government enforcement of public health policy has always been difficult because peoples attitudes are associated with the availability of information and the access to that information Even though the stricter COVID rules in Texas came in later McClellan said the governors order and subsequent media messaging about the benefits of masks and social distancing will help residents It changes peoples behavior he told ABC News I think actions by leaders encourage people to take these steps McClellan and other experts said governments have to step up their efforts to clear up the confusion among residents and cut down on their reluctance to adhere to COVID19 safety measures Moreover they need to focus more on health information than politics Dave Kerner the mayor of Palm Beach County Florida told ABC News hes taken more steps to make sure his residents take the pandemic seriously The county is one of the many locations in the state that has seen a jump in cases with 17242 confirmed coronavirus cases and 543 deaths as of July 6 Statewide there were 240710 COVID19 cases and over 4200 deaths related to the virus as of July 10 according to the Florida Health Department On Friday there were 11000 newly reported cases across the state according to Florida Health Department data Last month Palm Countys health department mandated face coverings even though there is no statewide order to do so Some residents have been vocal about their disapproval of the order and have come to public meetings without masks to jeer Kerner and the health department Kerner said these residents represent the hyper minority of his constituents and many people are taking heed of the orders This pandemic has really galvanized an immense portion of this population to be like OK were not only going to comply with this law Were going to be ambassadors and spread the word he told ABC News Kerner said his office is going the extra mile through a task force led by the countys first responders that goes out and educates people about the virus His office is in the process of mailing out over 3 million masks four per household to every resident It makes it easier for them to comply and it doesnt cost the city that much the mayor said Kerner a former police officer acknowledged that even though it may be hard to put the toothpaste back in the tube he is willing to order the closure of businesses if cases continue to rise However he is confident that more people in his city and the state will come to accept the harsh realities and take action on their own When you see the hospitals fill up you cant fight that metric he said"},
{"7408": "President   flatly contradicted his aides on Tuesday when he said he does not kid after they had for days been arguing he was joking when he said at a weekend campaign rally he had told officials to slow down   testing It was yet another instance of the White House scrambling to come up with language to play down one of his comments that had triggered a firestorm only to have Trump himself in the end providing a completely different explanation This time top deputies had repeatedly argued Trump was kidding when he told supporters in Tulsa Oklahoma on Saturday When you do testing to that extent youre going to find more people youre going to find more cases So I said to my people Slow the testing down please But on Tuesday Trump said he does not joke I don’t kid Trump told reporters outside the White House Tuesday en route to speak to young supporters at a megachurch and visit the USMexico border in Arizona a coronavirus hotspot Let me just tell you  let me make it clear We have got the greatest testing program anywhere in the world The morning after Trumps speech in Tulsa White House trade adviser Peter Navarro had said in   that Trumps comment was tongue in cheek That was a light moment for him at a rally Navarro said Then on Monday morning Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  who has been intimately involved in the Trump administrations response to the coronavirus pandemic  told ABC News he had not heard any conversations about slowing down testing and that Trump must have been joking Later that morning in   a reporter asked Trump himself  twice  if he had actually asked his staff to slow down testing Given the opportunity to expand on his widely criticized comment the president said nothing about whether he had been kidding Uh Trump said pausing If it did slow down frankly I think were way ahead of ourselves if you want to know the truth Weve done too good a job Soon after ABC News asked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany   whether Trump had actually ordered officials to slow testing No he has not directed that McEnany said She added that any suggestion that testing has been curtailed is not rooted in fact It was a comment that he made in jest she said Pressed about the appropriateness of making light of the topic of the coronavirus that has killed more than 120000 Americans McEnany said Trump was joking about the media and their failure to understand the fact that when you test more you also find more cases In another interview recorded Monday Trump was asked explicitly whether his comment had been tongue in cheek “It’s semitongue in cheek the president   k I say it all the time I know some people thought it was tongue in cheek It’s unfair Were doing so much testing so much more than any other country And to be honest with you when you do more testing you find more cases” Asked if he ordered his staff to stop coronavirus testing Trump said No but I think we put ourselves at a disadvantage I told my people I said Weve gotten so good at testing Instead of doing 25 million tests let’s say we did 10 million tests he added Wed look like we were doing much better because wed have far fewer cases Apparently in reference to whether he told them to stop testing he added I wouldnt do that But I will say this We do so much more than other countries It makes us in a way look bad but actually we’re doing the right thing But then one day later Trump contradicted not just his aides but himself It was not the first time Trump and the White House press secretary found themselves in discord trying to explain a controversial comment from the president In April after Trump   for suggesting that an injection of a disinfectant could be used to treat coronavirus McEnany first argued the comment had been taken out of context Hours later Trump said he had been speaking sarcastically On Tuesday asked by a reporter outside the White House if he was kidding or if he had a plan to slow down testing Trump replied I don’t kid As he had done Saturday Trump explained that more testing leads to a higher number of coronavirus cases  which can be true in absolute terms but according to public health experts is not the sole reason for rising infection rates in many cities and states across the country Testing a larger portion of the population can actually also lead to a decrease in the percentage of people who test positive​ since with more tests available people less likely to actually be infected – who would not have gotten tested before – get tested at a higher rate Despite those facts Trump repeated his argument that the reason we have more cases than other countries is because our testing is so much He did not directly answer if he wanted testing in the US slowed instead explaining that testing is a doubleedged sword In one way it tells you you have cases he said In another way you find out where the cases are and you do a good job A couple of hours later two top US public health officials infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci and the coordinator of coronavirus testing at the federal level Adm Brett Giroir said during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday that neither Trump nor anyone in the administration had ever told them to slow testing Asked to explain the president saying “I don’t kid” McEnany told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday that at his rally in Tulsa Trump “was making a serious point but he was using sarcasm to do that” The serious point he was making is that when you test more people you identify more cases” she said During   that was recorded Monday and aired Tuesday morning Trump said “I don’t mean slow down but if we did slow down or if we didn’t do so many let’s say instead of 25 million tests we did 5 million tests we’d be very low in cases right now And everybody would say isn’t that wonderful”"},
{"7178": "President   focused attention on possible treatments for the new   on Thursday citing potential use of a drug long used to treat malaria and some other approaches still in testing At a White House news conference Trump and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn cited the malaria drug chloroquine along with remdesivir an experimental antiviral from Gilead Sciences and possibly using plasma from survivors of COVID19 the disease the new virus causes Those treatments are among several being tested that might ease symptoms but do not stop the virus from spreading Also on Thursday Swiss drugmaker Roche said it was working with the US government to start a study of Actemra a drug used now for rheumatoid arthritis and some other conditions against the coronavirus Were looking at drugs that are already approved for other indications as a potential bridge or stopgap Hahn said while also doing rigorous studies to see if the drugs truly make a difference versus usual care and if they are safe when used for a new purpose “We want to make sure this is done well and right” he said No drug is specifically approved now for treating COVID19 Chloroquine and a similar drug — hydroxychloroquine sold as Plaquenil by French drugmaker Sanofi and in generic form — are available now and can be used offlabel in the United States They may interfere with the coronavirus being able to enter cells and some scientists have reported possible encouraging signs in testtube and other small studies German drugmaker Bayer has said it would donate 3 million tablets of its chloroquine drug Resochin for use against coronavirus That drug was never approved in the US so Bayer is working with federal agencies to get an emergencyuse authorization Chloroquine and remdesivir are among the drugs the World Health Organization said would be tried in a fivepart international study announced Wednesday Already approved drugs are tempting for doctors to use off label but formal studies are needed to see if they truly work for a new purpose or disease said Dr Ross McKinney Jr chief scientific officer for the Association of American Medical Colleges which represents about 400 major teaching hospitals across the country Chloroquine may look promising in a test tube but “Im skeptical it will be effective” in patients he said Thursday in a call with reporters Remdesivir interferes with virus reproduction and has shown some promise in lab and animal studies against other coronaviruses that cause similar diseases MERS and SARS Its being tested in at least five separate experiments and Gilead also has given it to several hundred severely ill patients in the US Europe and Japan under compassionate use provisions That includes three of the first dozen COVID19 patients in the United States They recovered but its impossible to know whether they would have anyway without the drug On a podcast Wednesday with a medical journal editor the National Institutes of Healths Dr Anthony Fauci said China had enrolled several hundred people in its two remdesivir studies but is having trouble recruiting more because many patients just want the drug and are unwilling to take a chance on being randomly assigned to a comparison group that just gets usual care It would be great if an independent monitoring board could look at results so far and see if there are signs of safety or effectiveness Fauci said We desperately need the data on this and other drugs being tested in rigorous scientific studies Fauci said Weve got to be able to determine if they work and if theyre safe Apart from the studies in China Faucis agency is running a         study of remdesivir that aims to recruit 400 patients in the US and elsewhere That study is adaptive meaning it will allow scientists to add other drugs under the same testing umbrella as time goes on Gilead also has said it will do two         studies testing remdesivir treatment for five or 10 days in about 1000 hospitalized patients primarily in Asia Remdesivir does look like it could be promising said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes chief of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston In animal tests it was quite effective at preventing infection and reducing severity of illness and damage to the lungs when given early enough in the course of illness he said It interferes with the enzyme that reproduces the genetic material of the virus and acts at an earlier step than protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavir which are used now to treat HIV and also are being tested against the new coronavirus Kuritzkes explained The HIV drugs gave disappointing results failing to shorten illness in a study of 199 severely ill hospitalized patients in China scientists from that country reported Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine Some other studies testing the HIV drug combo are still underway The Roche drug Actemra is used now for rheumatoid arthritis and some other conditions It targets interleukin6 which plays a role in inflammation Roches US subsidiary Genentech said Thursday that it was working with the FDA to start a 330patient study on hospitalized COVID19 patients in April Regeneron Pharmaceuticals says it will lanch a study of Kevzara its rheumatoid arthritis drug that also targets interleukin6 against the coronavirus A Japanese company Fujifilm Toyama Chemical says tests suggest its drug favipiravir used to treat the flu in Japan shows promise against the coronavirus though no large studies of that have been published yet Other companies are developing monoclonal antibodies proteins that specifically fight the coronavirus Antibodies or combinations of them were tried against Ebola and doctors think a similar approach may help against the new virus

Ashton and Tom Bossert tracking the virus plus top Trump adviser Larry Kudlow on the White House plan for economic recovery ANNOUNCER From ABC News its This Week Here now coanchor Martha Raddatz RADDATZ Good morning and thanks for joining us this Sunday Its been another shocking and sobering week Since we came on the air last Sunday the number of cases in the US has skyrocketed climbing from roughly 25000 cases to nearly 125000 cases this morning and worldwide close to 700000 confirmed cases In the US the virus has now claimed more than 2100 lives including the tragic death of an infant in Illinois announced yesterday While New York has emerged as the epicenter in the US cities like Detroit Boston New Orleans and Chicago are experiencing a dramatic rise in cases and bracing for impact President Trumps response has run the gamut this week On Tuesday the president said hes aiming to have the country reopened and just raring to go by Easter On Wednesday that goal was seemingly modified to a recommendation by Easter On Thursday in a letter to governors Trump suggested a type of triage system relaxing social distancing guidelines and other measures based on the number of cases in each county And just yesterday he raised taking a tougher approach at least for some areas of the country threatening a twoweek quarantine for parts of hardhit New York New Jersey and Connecticut before asking the CDC to issue a travel advisory instead RADDATZ New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy joins me now There are more than 11000 confirmed cases in that state Governor Murphy good morning The president said Saturday he was considering an enforceable quarantine on New York New Jersey and Connecticut New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo said he considered that an act of war on the state Trump has now said after consulting with Cuomo and you and the governor of Connecticut he will issue a strong advisory instead What can you tell us about that consultation GOV PHIL MURPHY DNJ Yes Good to be back Martha We had a lot of back and forth both among the three governors which we do regularly these days as well as with the White House The fact of that matter is our three states  and I know New Jersey is obviously the best We’re doing about as aggressive a set of steps as any states in America right now So as challenging as this is and you’re right over 11000 positives and tragically 140 dead as of yesterday in the Garden State the fact of the matter is people really aren’t really traveling a whole lot A travel warning we’re fine with The fact of the matter is we are all in flattening that curve social distancing as aggressive as any states in America and we’ll continue to be that way RADDATZ So there will be no real enforcement of this because people just aren’t traveling MURPHY Well it’s a travel advisory so we take that seriously and we will execute it by the states and that’s something that as I say it’s defacto happening already and we’ll make sure  listen we are pounding the table morning noon and night stay home stay home stay home So if there’s another message point we can add to that we’re happy to add to that But we want folks to stay home and flatten this curve and break the back of this virus RADDATZ New Jersey has more than eight times the number of confirmed cases now compared to when we spoke a week ago and you’ve already issued as you say that stay at home order So why wouldn’t a quarantine like this be effective MURPHY Again Martha we are defacto staying at home as a state There are 9 million of us You’re absolutely right the numbers have gone up dramatically But we expected this and we told our folks it would happen Part of it’s due to community spread but a big part of is we have opened up testing aggressively So the fact of the matter is folks  they’re already getting the message to stay at home We’re enforcing that If we think within New Jersey there are stronger steps we can take we consider them regularly and we will take them This again as an advisory adds to a message that we’ve already  that we’ll have already been stark about And remember the tests that we’re getting back yesterday may be as much as a week or so since the specimen was collected so we’re not yet seeing the numbers for the most dramatic steps we’ve taken on social distancing We probably won’t see that for another week or so RADDATZ And let’s talk about the situation in your hospitals Last week you told me New Jersey was desperate for personal protective equipment and the Federal Government had only given you a fraction of what you asked for You’ve now received a shipment from the stockpile including 120000 N95 masks and a thousand medical beds Is that enough MURPHY Yeah listen we had gotten another shipment in our private sector our hospital systems We’ve shutdown elective surgery so we’re getting equipment from that But we’re still way short We have a long way to go I’d say Martha the big headline for us right now are ventilators We had a very specific conversation with the White House last night about ventilators That’s our number one ask It’s our number one need And that’s the one that we are focused most on right now We have a long way to go on the whole PPE front but we’ve made more progress in other areas than we have right now on ventilators That’s our big focus RADDATZ You asked about ventilators What was the answer MURPHY They’re trying to work with us and listen we’re trying to find common ground 24 hours a day 7 days a week And we had a very specific conversation about our asks and the potential to perhaps phase that in as they can deliver We need them though There’s no question about it RADDATZ You sure do like so many others Governor we thank you for joining us again this morning MURPHY Thanks for having me Martha RADDATZ And as officials race to contain the outbreak in the tristate area new hot spots are emerging here in the US among them Louisiana Last Sunday there were 837 confirmed cases in the case Today there are over 3300 Joining me now is the governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards And Governor Edwards our condolences to you this morning with this sad announcement that you lost a young staffer to complications from the virus 33yearold April Dunn She is part of an alarming rise of infections and deaths in Louisiana Tell us what you are seeing this morning in your state And again our condolences EDWARDS Well thank you very much Marta  Martha and its good to be with you We obviously have a spread that is growing faster than  than we would like to see We remain on a trajectory really to overwhelm our capacity to deliver health care By the end of the first week in April we think the first real issue is going to be ventilators And  and we think its about the fourth or fifth of April before down in the New Orleans area were unable to put people on ventilators who need them And then several days later we will be out of beds Now were surging our capacity now both with our existing footprint of hospitals but also in the convention center down in New Orleans And so were going to be able to get those beds up but  but the staffing remains very difficult and the ventilators are  are what we need right now You know weve had orders in for more than 12000 ventilators some through the national stockpile and others through private vendors Thus far over the last several weeks weve been able to get only 192 And so we continue to work this extremely hard But in the meantime my message to Louisiana is really no different than the message that youre seeing out of the New York governor and the New Jersey governor We need people to practice the mitigation measures we have in place the shelterathome that we have statewide now so that we can slow this spread We  we cannot have everybody presenting to the hospital which is what will happen if we dont slow the spread We should know in the next three or four days whether the stayathome order that I put in place is going to have the intended effect But we know that mitigation works but it only works to the extent that its actually complied with And so were hopeful that these  that the curve does start to flatten here in the next few days But were in a very very difficult place here in Louisiana with the number two case count per capita in the United States and  Im sorry  number three per capita case count number two with per capita deaths And so were  were in a very difficult place Martha RADDATZ And Governor you said in your press conference on Thursday We are not going to enforce our way through this meaning keeping people home People need to comply you said If the outbreak continues to worsen and residents dont comply will you consider stronger enforcement measures EDWARDS Oh sure And when I said that its not like we dont have law enforcement out going to businesses and telling them whether they are supposed to be closed or not or just  or if you have a large group of people that theyre telling them that they have to leave But we have 47 million people We have tends of thousands of business We have 4500 churches And so my point to the people of Louisiana is Look dont look for us to come enforce this We need you to take it upon yourself to comply Because really thats the only way that were going to be successful And so its not that were not going to enforce these measures at all but we shouldnt be  be made to enforce them is the point that I was trying to deliver to the Louisiana people RADDATZ And Governor Mardi Gras is now believed to be one of the sources of Louisianas outbreak Dr Fauci said your state likely should have issued a stayathome order sooner And the New Orleans mayor said just yesterday it wasnt canceled because the federal government said it was contained Is that the reason EDWARDS Well look there was never any hint from anyone to me or to the mayor of New Orleans that there should be any consideration to downsizing or canceling Mardi Gras I think if you look back there were about 15 cases in the country all of which were tied directly to travel or indirectly to travel and there was never any hint of this And if youll go back you will see that the federal government was saying things were well under control And so this is some Monday morning quarterbacking going on And quite frankly I believe its likely that  that Mardi Gras contributed to the seeding of the virus in and around New Orleans a million and a half people just 13 days before the first confirmed case here on March the 9th But  but thats looking back Right now we need to spend our time our energy we need to be focused on doing what we can do right now in going forward And Im sure that  that somebodys going to do a study about the  the impact of Mardi Gras on this particular public health emergency later RADDATZ And thank you very much for joining us this morning Governor And we wish you all the best EDWARDS Martha thank you so much

Bossert are standing by Well be right back COMMERCIAL BREAK RADDATZ In a sea of statistics and neverending headlines in this coronavirus crisis its easy to overlook the human toll of it all And sometimes its personal This week I checked in with Dr Erin Beaumont a young emergency medicine doctor in Massachusetts who I have known since she was in college On Monday the ICU at the emergency room at Everett Hospital where Erin is working was already filling up So I asked her to keep a video diary documenting daytoday life on the front lines as she waits for a surge of patients she expects in the coming days DR ERIN BEAUMONT ER ATTENDING PHYSICIAN CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE Its Tuesday March 24th it is 448 pm I am about to go into my shift When I left yesterday our ICU was full and we havent even come close to starting our surge yet and so I am nervous about that because once we do get our surge I dont know where were going to put these people I dont know how were going to treat these people appropriately I dont know  I don’t know what were gonna do BEAUMONT ON SCREEN UPPER LEFT  WEDNESDAY MARCH 25TH AROUND 145AM sighs I just got out of my shift I took care of a patient who is my age Normal healthy person who I admitted because he  Im guessing we wont know yet but Im guessing he has COVID19 based on the way he looked the way he was breathing his chest xray it’s heartbreaking though and it it makes me nervous because hes my age and hes young and hes healthy and I worry that were just going to see more and more like that BEAUMONT ON SCREEN UPPER LEFT  WEDNESDAY MARCH 25TH AROUND 900AM I went to look in on the patient that I was taking care of last night The one thats my age who is there with presumed Covid19 and he is now in the intensive care unit BEAUMONT ON SCREEN UPPER LEFT  THURSDAY MARCH 26TH AROUND 1130PM Its Thursday March 26th Its about 1130 and night um I just got back from my shift Were just waiting we’re sitting here waiting for the inevitable terribleness that we know is going to happen and it kind of eats away at you And its really its really hard And the prospect of this country being open for business and back to normal in a couple of weeks by Easter is both ridiculous and dangerous and theres no way BEAUMONT ON SCREEN UPPER LEFT  FRIDAY MARCH 27TH AROUND 3PM I spoke to my mom today She asked me a question  do you have enough PPE to get you through the surge And my answer was I dont know Which brings up another interesting point which is you know  what do you do where do you draw the line between protecting yourself and helping your patients Thats something that Ive been kind of grappling with morally I feel that Im in a very unique position to be able to help people right now I have asthma and I worry that if I do get sick I wont do well and so its a really  it’s a really hard position to be in BEAUMONT ON SCREEN CREDIT MARCH 29 AROUND 230AM At some point this evening all of a sudden we just got overwhelmed ambulance after ambulance It all happened at once our ICUs are full Our floors are full The emergency room is full RADDATZ So distressing to hear and our thanks to Dr Beaumont for sharing her story For more now on how hospitals and communities are dealing with this crisis lets bring in ABC News chief medical correspondent Dr Jennifer Ashton and former Trump homeland security adviser and ABC News contributor Tom Bossert And let me start with you Dr Jen Heartbreaking stories from that doctor and so many other healthcare workers I know your brother is on the frontlines as well The United States now has more than 120000 confirmed cases the most in the world and hit that horrible 2000death milestone Where would you say we are today in the cycle Has the curve been flattened at all in any places DR JENNIFER ASHTON ABC NEWS CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT  Well we dont know Only time will tell Martha because when youre dealing with an infectious disease outbreak as Dr Tony Fauci has said youre always behind So its important to remember we still dont know a lot about how this virus behaves We think there could be up to twoweek incubation period And then it takes time for people to develop systems and actually become sick So what were seeing today actually probably represents something that happened two to four weeks ago And if you think that way we dont know what two to four weeks from now will look like RADDATZ  And Tom the president floated that Easter deadline you heard what the president said to get the economy up and running again he said he would release guidelines early next week so that certain lowrisk areas might be able to ease up on social distancing But we’ve continued to see new hotspots emerge all over this country And how can you set guidelines when  as Jen said we have so little data TOM BOSSERT FORMER TRUMP HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER  Yeah you know you just cant What a week We saw him start out hearing the “dont flatten the economy flatten the curve” line I think that made him nervous And he went out with a very hopeful Easter deadline Later in the week he kind of 180degree reversed with a datadriven letter to the governors suggesting were going to move out of this in a careful manner and even conceded that some places in our country will have to increase their distancing measures So I think at this stage as this expires on Monday the 15 days responsibly I think the president has no choice but to extend this national blanket intervention order RADDATZ  Because Tom even if there are fewer cases than predicted let’s say that does not mean that these extreme measures were not necessary BOSSERT  Yes In fact I would argue that while we cant quantify to Dr Jen’s point that we can see some evidence that this is working In fact its almost certainly working If we hadnt taken these extreme measures we would expect to see an even higher unfortunately number We cant tell you exactly how much better We can’t prove that negative but its clearly less than the 20 percent attack rate that we had feared and that we had seen elsewhere So we have to stay this course And a message to people  we have to stop cheating Any time even a small percentage of our society steps out of these lines the cheating has a significant effect on the  on the slope of this infection curve RADDATZ  And Jen more and more states and cities you heard the governor say they are desperate for equipment in hospitals You’ve seen the images out of hospitals like Elmhurst hospital in New York But this is what Dr Deborah Birx who is on the president’s task force said just Thursday BEGIN VIDEO CLIP DR DEBORAH BIRX CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE  To say that to the American people to make the implication that when they need a hospital bed its not going to be there or when they need that ventilator it’s not going to be there we dont have an evidence of that right now END VIDEO CLIP RADDATZ  She was clearly trying to reassure But how do you see that ASHTON  Heres the thing about ventilators When you take into account that image that symbol it is so fearproducing because its a machine that literally can make the difference between life and death That is true But if you look at a paper that was just published in The New England Journal of Medicine research done out of University of Pennsylvania we could have a million ventilators Martha The key and critical component is not actually as much the machine as the people who operate it the respiratory therapists the critical care nurses And according to that UPenn paper the maximum number of trained professionals we have is about 100000 There are ratios that for every person on a ventilator they need a certain number of respiratory therapists It could be a 41 ratio but the critical and ratelimiting factor may actually be the health care worker and not the machines So we have to take that with a massive grain of salt RADDATZ  And in some places they are even asking for volunteers Tom the situation in places like New York or California is bad but the epicenter is going to shift What do you see in the coming weeks in other areas of the country BOSSERT  Yes Unfortunately youre right And I dont want to be too predictive here but the numbers are awfully alarming as we watch them move into those flash points where they start to grow into that exponential curve in places like Detroit New Orleans Chicago And places in Florida right now are very worrying when you look at the numbers of deaths which are indicative of a lot of spread against the size of the populations in some of those counties And then when you run it against what seems to be societal cheating I will call it people not quite taking this as seriously as they should and what will happen then is we’ll think we wish we had taken steps two weeks ago that we should have taken And we dont want to get into that regret loop that we saw in New York So if youre worried about travel restrictions and that debate in New York today think about how that might apply in New Orleans tomorrow RADDATZ  And Jen we have about 30 seconds left So I want to just ask you whats your message to Americans in the coming weeks What should they do ASHTON  Well I think as we have heard Dr Fauci say we dont want to look back and wish we could have done more We in fact want to do the opposite We want to overreact And I think as people deal with the emotions of this pandemic which are very real and theyre as important as the physical factors the fear the anxiety the concernthose are all normal But we have to proceed based on evidence and not emotion and just focus on whats important now And I think thats really the key RADDATZ  Thanks very much Dr Ashton and Tom Bossert Youre doing important work Up next  Congress passes a record 2 trillion relief package and that might not be enough to shore up the economic damage of the coronavirus The White Houses economic director joins me live next COMMERCIAL BREAK DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES This is a very important day I’ll sign the single biggest economic relief package in American history I want to thank Republicans and Democrats for coming together

power not just people that are well to do but the everyday common man to make sure that were all OK END VIDEOTAPE RADDATZ So lets dig into that 2 trillion stimulus bill the president signed with President Trumps top economic adviser Larry Kudlow Mr Kudlow you heard that plea from a single mom to make sure everyone will be OK What do you say to her to reassure her and millions of other Americans that they will be OK LARRY KUDLOW DIRECTOR WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL Well it’s going to be the biggest assistance package in history Martha I mean I hope she does well A lot of the people you talked to had a sense of optimism I love that Weve got to fight together to get through the effects of the virus in economic terms Safety comes first But were doing the best we can Weve got a 62 trillion assistance package And just some of the quick factoids  we’re basically going to be providing significant assistance to 175 million people 175 million people Roughly 600 billion dollars is allocated to that And to the small business  small business which will go up next week theres another 350 billion and then when you count the payroll tax holiday youre going to be moving towards 500 billion or 600 billion Were trying to keep folks working We’re trying to let them have enough assistance to get through daily family needs with the kids some of them may be home We are going to cover their sick pay leave as I think you know And we’re also protecting payrolls All the loans and loan guarantees will be forgivable  well first they’ll be made and then they’ll be forgivable provided the small business people hang on to their payroll So it may not be perfect but I think it’s going to give tremendous amount of resources to get us through what we still believe is going to be a question of weeks and months  hopefully weeks  maybe I should say prayerfully weeks But we think we can get through this period RADDATZ  We know about those eyepopping numbers this week 2 trillion stimulus package with checks going out to millions and millions of Americans as you say But will that be enough given those soaring unemployment numbers more than 3 million people KUDLOW  Well I think it will be enough I mean you know the whole package when you take the 22 trillion of direct federal assistance which by the way goes to states and goes to hospitals and goes to medical equipment covering the waterfront you know youre really talking about onethird of GDP onethird of the whole economy is being covered by this package Thats really quite remarkable Its the largest mainstream financial assistance package in the history of the United States So its hard to know if we can get everything  help everybody but I think  I’m an optimist I think the sheer resources here we are putting in whatever it takes we’re using every federal power lever possible to help folks It’s going right into the middle lowermiddle class people And by the way Martha other things student loans are going to be deferred Payment on student loans is going to be deferred Income tax payments are going to be deferred for several months As I said as the small business  CROSSTALK RADDATZ  Mr Kudlow you say weeks  you say weeks not months  but how can you be sure this economic tragedy won’t be long term if there’s no guarantee that people will have jobs to return to Because getting those businesses reopened we’ve heard it from them with changes necessary to ensure people stay healthy will take time Coffee shops are not going to look the way they did before theaters So what is waiting for unemployed people on the other side of this I dont see how it can be just weeks KUDLOW  Well listen I say that weeks it could be four weeks it could be eight weeks I say that hopefully and I say that prayerfully Thats what some of the science experts are telling us I don’t know if they’ll be right But let me just say this you cant have a good job unless you have a healthy business And what we’ve tried to do is to provide tremendous tremendous assistance to the individual men and women and therefore on the other side tremendous assistance to the small businesses for which they work Were trying to balance this out And I think thats really the first time this kind of package has ever been put forward I cant guarantee it I cant wave a magic wand I wish I could I’ve spent all my career being an optimist and trying to promote economic growth This virus nobody expected this thing to come down as far and hard and widespread as it did but it did And we are  CROSSTALK RADDATZ  Mr Kudlow I want to  I want to stop you there just for a second including you It was  it was also just a month ago you told CNBC that you thought the virus was contained in the country even though doctors were warning others  otherwise you also downplayed the threat of a longlasting economic tragedy You have since said that was based on facts at the time KUDLOW  Yes RADDATZ  But why should people trust you this morning with your prediction KUDLOW  Look I’m as good as the facts are And at the time I made that statement the facts were contained The president had just put the travel restrictions on China and a lot of people agreed with me In fact at the time a lot of people thought that the flu was worse than this virus But as soon as the facts changed we changed our whole posture and our whole strategy and weve gone full bore as I said No package like this has ever been passed Congress before And look as the president has said we will do more if need be Let’s just try to get this done now  CROSSTALK RADDATZ  How quickly can you get those checks out KUDLOW  Couple of weeks The direct  RADDATZ  Given the infrastructure that much money those  that number of checks KUDLOW  The  the direct checks will come out probably in a couple  two weeks I believe Secretary Mnuchin is saying The loans to the small businesses will be ready for processing this coming week OK this coming Friday So we will have rapid speed much faster than has been done in the past with these things And so we will get it into peoples hands right away And dont forget also please regarding things like rent payments or rental home loans all that will  evictions  let may add that  all that will be put on hold There will be no evictions during this period Principal and interest on loans if theyre federal loans can be suspended Theres a moratorium on student loans We tried to cover every single base as we realized the scope and spread of this thing RADDATZ  And Mr Kudlow KUDLOW  So its really as much as anybody has ever done And by the way we have provided temporary emergency financing from the Treasury Department to unlock massive massive resources from the Federal Reserve That  resources will help stabilize financial markets will also stabilize credit card payments student loan payments money market funds stock market RADDATZ  Mr Kudlow I just want  if you would quickly please even in the most optimistic scenarios how can you spend that kind of money and not raise taxes KUDLOW  Well were not raising taxes Were cutting taxes right now The whole package is essentially direct assistance on the spending side and largescale tax cuts As I said 180  180  175 million I will put that number 175 million Martha are going to get tax rebates And massive amounts of small business probably half of the companies in the US are going to get rebates or deferred payroll tax holidays And we will cover their expenses And we will forgive the loans as long as they keep the payroll going So we have tried to hit both sides Were helping the individuals Were helping the small business Those are the major components of the American economy I hope that the machinery works Secretary Mnuchin is working hard Our National Economic Council is working hard RADDATZ  Im going to have to stop you there Mr Kudlow I know that youre all working hard and we really appreciate you appearing this morning on the program KUDLOW Thank you Appreciate it very much RADDATZ Thanks very much So lets get some analysis now from ABC chief business and economics correspondent Rebecca Jarvis Rebecca first your reaction to what you just heard from Larry Kudlow REBECCA JARVIS ABC NEWS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT  Well Martha first of all I think the key question is how long does this last and what does the world look like on the other side And Larry Kudlow talked about that 22 trillion stimulus an eyepopping number That stimulus is frankly to plug a gigantic hole the zero dollars coming into most American businesses right now the zero dollars in the pockets of more than three million Americans who were laid off last week So when you think about these stimulus programs plus the 4 trillion backstop from the Federal Reserve it is to plug a gigantic void in the system And the question is as we go through this the longer we last in this void what does the world look like on the other side And I spoke earlier this week with the CEO of Starbucks whos now been through this already in China where they closed a number of stores 95 percent of those stores Martha have reopened And I asked him about traffic in those stores because we know the world when things start to reopen how are people going to respond And he said the traffic picks up a little more each week but there are still social distancing measures inside of the stores And for many American businesses this will be a new reality of the future fewer tables for example if youre a restaurant in your shop maybe fewer people coming in if youre a hairdresser All these different types of American business are going to have a different amount of foot traffic in the future And the question is how long can they really hold on for even with this gigantic stimulus RADDATZ And Rebecca just in these coming weeks do you think things could get much worse JARVIS Well if we continue to see the type of layoffs that we saw that more than three million number that we saw last week  and we very likely will continue to see the layoffs continue We know for example that there were technical issues with websites the unemployment insurance Web sites crashing So we know that there will be more layoffs especially with lockdowns We know that unemployment that unemployment rate which was 35 percent in February is very likely to climb much higher in the coming weeks If it were to climb to the worstcase scenarios we would be looking Martha at 20 percent unemployment That is what we saw in the Great Depression In the Great Recession it was 10 percent So we know these numbers are going to continue to climb But here is something we also know the American people are resilient And you heard this in your package the number of unemployed workers out there who are doing everything I hear from small businesses every single day they are doing everything in their power to keep their employees on board Theyre running GoFundMe’s people in neighborhoods and communities on websites like Nextdoor are showing up for their neighborhoods So we know that people are going to do everything in their power to help but that fundamental question is for how long How long can this last RADDATZ Thanks so much Rebecca And the American people are indeed inspiring thanks for joining us ABCs Jon Karl is standing by and joins me next Were back in just 60 seconds COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JONATHAN KARL ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT  Are you able to guarantee to assure these states these hospitals that everybody who needs a ventilator will get a ventilator TRUMP I think were in great shape I hope thats the case I hope that were going to have leftovers so we can help other people other countries KARL Everybody who needs one will be able to get a ventilator TRUMP  Look look dont be a cutie pie OK everyone who needs one nobody has ever done what weve done END VIDEO CLIP RADDATZ The president on Friday talking about my colleague Jon Karl who has covered Mr Trump for about as long as anyone dating back to when Trump was a fixture of the New York tabloids Jon is out with a timely new book called Front Row at the Trump Show which is quite literally where Jon finds himself more often than not Jon its great to see you and congratulations on this book The president we saw the last few weeks who has rarely stepped into the briefing room is now there every single day KARL Its really something else I mean literally Martha for three years of his presidency he almost never went into that place He had one appearance where he didnt take questions now he has discovered that this is the place where he can be front and center and he is there every single day taking questions RADDATZ And Jon you have covered him since 1994 I love looking at all of the old pictures in the book of the two of you but what have you learned from your time covering him How does it inform you when youre look at this crisis today KARL Well I see so much that I wrote about in this book and what I tried to do is I tried to tell a story I tried to convey what it has been like to be covering this singular moment in American history with a president unlike any we have ever seen And what I have seen is so much of what I looked at and what I have experienced we see playing out to the extreme here One of the themes here is the ways in which the president runs his own show the way hes his own communications director hes his own national security adviser he is his own press secretary RADDATZ Gone through a few chiefs of staff KARL He is his own chief of staff And this crisis hit at precisely the moment that he literally had no chief of staff acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was on the way out Mark Meadows who to this moment is still a member of Congress and not formally the chief of staff hes literally been doing it himself calling the shots without any guardrails This is pure Donald Trump RADDATZ  And pure Donald Trump in that he always seems to have an enemy He appeals to his base no matter what Its the Democrats fault its the medias fault Its  its whoevers fault Its a governor in Michigans fault Thats pure Donald Trump KARL Absolutely And  and  and often the news media And he goes back and forth I mean one day hes attacking Andrew Cuomo the next day hes praising him Day after day after day he seems to be blaming the entire crisis on the Democrats or on the news media and then he comes out and hes saying actually I think you guys have been doing a really good job or pretty good job covering this Its been back and forth back and forth because hes a guy that does this by instinct This really is  he  he cares Obviously he wants to get through this crisis Everybody does But he sees this as part of the  the  what I call the Trump show He looks at the numbers Whos watching What are the  RADDATZ And even in this crisis KARL I mean do you remember when  when  in the early days of this crisis when the  when the cruise ship was coming in to  to California and he actually said he didnt really want it to come ashore because it would ruin his numbers His numbers would double the number of cases You know I  I wonder I think  theres been a lot of selfcongratulations every day that we see in those briefings frankly about the testing in the United States the testing and were doing so well were doing now more than South Korea did RADDATZ Although thats per capita no  KARL You  you know how bad the testing situation remains Martha we had a  we have a member of the White House press corps who last week  last week came down with what we  was a presumed case of coronavirus Took a test on Tuesday We still dont have the results to that test So we dont know if the colleague who many of us have been sitting in the briefing with there actually has coronavirus Its not working Its not working yet And I wonder you know how strong that push was from the president on testing early on How strong was it Because again more testing more numbers RADDATZ And  and one of the things hes also been focused on besides these mixed messages despite what hes telling people is getting the country back but he seems to float these ideas and then take them back the Easter in two weeks and then maybe not well just recommend its Easter KARL Yes it  and its  and its like hey that sounds great And that was  that was something  and by  wouldnt it be wonderful if we could all be packed in churches Christians across the country on Easter Sunday Well he  he sees it He sees the image Comes up with it Boom Was that a subject of discussion No this is Donald Trump who again plays by instinct plays by gut And  and you see through the course of the book Ive  RADDATZ Do you think hes nervous about his numbers with the election coming up KARL Hes always obsessed with his numbers So Im sure hes concerned when he sees bad numbers He asks virtually every day by the way what the latest count is on his Twitter followers his Instagram followers his Facebook followers He cares about any kind of metric numbers of how he is perceived RADDATZ And very quickly Jon you write in your book about the dangers of Trumps war on truth Will this do lasting damage KARL I really worry that we are in a situation now where Donald Trump has undermined faith in the news media amongst so many of his followers and where so  and  and where his lack of credibility on so many issues has undermined truth with the other half of the country RADDATZ We should all read your book I already have Its terrific KARL Thank you RADDATZ Thanks to all of  thanks for all of us today Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us Check out WORLD NEWS TONIGHT Stay strong and stay safe COMMERCIAL BREAK"},
{"5922": "As the   surges across the country several properties owned by President   have continued to host gatherings with guests and employees that skirt state and citymandated face covering ordinances as well as the organizations own public rules for   during the pandemic The president has over the course of the pandemic   when it comes to wearing a mask to fight the   not wearing one publicly until July even as health experts have said masks are key to slowing the spread In late May as the cases started to surge again across the country Trump shared a tweet mocking presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden for wearing a face mask during a Memorial Day public appearance Amid the presidents mixed signals in recent weeks guests and employees at Trump hotels from Washington DC to North Carolina have attended events and gathered in common areas without wearing masks flouting local mandates and guidelines that the presidents own properties have issued according to a review of social media posts While Trump for months has refused to wear a face covering in public the president on Monday   an   writing that many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you cant socially distance But hours later Trump held at fundraiser at Trump International Hotel in DC where multiple guests including the president White House chief of staff Mark Meadows Sen Lindsey Graham and Madison Cawthorn who recently won a Republican primary runoff for a western North Carolina congressional seat were all shown on camera at the hotel not wearing masks in the lobby bunched closely together and not social distancing while the president and attendees did not appear to be eating or drinking according to a video from the event posted by Cawthorn At Tuesdays first White House coronavirus press briefing in weeks the president was asked about not wearing a mask Monday night at his hotel claiming that he was pretty far away from people but I would say this Ive explained it I think very well If youre close together I would put on the mask despite video showing that not to be the case On May 13 Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser implemented a facecovering order for people in public places The website of the Trump hotel in Washington states that guests in common spaces such as the lobby are required to wear face coverings unless theyre eating The safety of our guests and employees remains our top priority the website states But in the clip the president addresses a small crowd of people who appear to be mostly not following city guidelines that state all hotel employees and guests wear masks The event site was sanitized beforehand and the White House Medical Unit and US Secret Service evaluated all attendees prior to them gaining access to the event according to Republican National Committee press secretary Mandi Merritt who told ABC News All attendees tested negative for COVID19 on the day of the event completed a wellness questionnaire and passed a temperature screening The Trump organization did not respond to a request for comment The Trump Hotel implemented the face mask policy to comply with the local ordinance in Washington DC The policy found on the Trump Hotel website states By government mandate face coverings are required for all associates and guests while in public areas where social distancing is not possible These areas include our lobby elevators guest corridors and dining outlets Other hotels across the nation are also looking to implement mandatory facecovering requirements for guests and associates similar to the Trump Hotel Chief Executive Officer of Marriott International Arne Sorenson announced Monday that all guests will be required to wear face coverings at all 7300 locations worldwide starting July 27 Staff have already been required to wear face coverings since April Several other social media posts show a wedding reception was held on July 4 at Trump International Hotel In a video shared by Ricardo Vazquez a wedding DJ for Dan Goldman events dozens of guests at the reception are shown dancing and celebrating  packed closely together with no one wearing a mask Vazquez who declined to comment wrote on Instagram that the reception was reduced in size from 100 to 48 Prominent proTrump figures have shared images at Trump properties while not wearing a mask in public spaces including My Pillow CEO Michael Lindell who posted an image on Facebook July 7 not wearing a face covering in the presidents DC hotel Farright social media personality Tim Gionet known as Baked Alaska also shared an image from the lobby of the same hotel not wearing a mask Greg Aselbekian a frequent patron also has a NO MASKS ALLOWED Birthday party set for the presidents Washington DC hotel according to a Facebook event page which states Were all tired of being unconstitutionally locked in like animals join me as I turn 27 Will spend the afternoon at Harrys if youd like to join then and finishing the night at Trump Hotel where Ill be staying too NO MASKS Aselbekian confirmed the planned event to ABC News adding that he contracted the coronavirus at the Conservative Political Action Conference in late February Yeah thats where I got it from he said It sucked for like three weeks It was like a flu on steroids Aselbekian a Marine veteran who according to LinkedIn is on the board of Veterans for Trump said he isnt afraid of catching it again and that he isnt going to live his life in fear and added that the president wearing a mask had no influence on what he will do I think for myself I dont follow a politician or a person blindly A lot of people do that both sides people are guilty Like I said I think for myself These instances arent limited

{"547": "WASHINGTON  President   is muddying the facts about mailin voting and vice presidential candidate   on the eve of the Democratic National Convention Asked to disclaim the racist conspiracy theory that Harris isnt eligible to serve in the White House because of her immigrant parents Trump repeatedly demurred and said he knew little about it even as the false rumors swirled on social media over the past week Harris unquestionably meets the Constitutions requirements to be vice president On Sunday Trumps own White House chief of staff acknowledged her eligibility Trump also continued to blast mailin voting as flawed and fraudulent while insisting that absentee mail ballots especially in states like Florida that he must win in November are quite fine and safe There are little differences in security measures between the two His weekend claims capped a litany of distortion and falsehoods following Joe Bidens announcement of Harris as his running mate He misrepresented Bidens position on taxes persisted in minimizing the coronavirus threat and exaggerated his own record on the economy A look at the past weeks rhetoric also covering Social Security and more MAIL VOTING TRUMP “Absentee is good mailin universal is very very bad There’s no way they’re going to get it accurately” — news conference Saturday TRUMP “The honorable thing to do is drop the MailIn Scam before it is too late Absentee Ballots like they have in Florida are good” — tweet Saturday THE FACTS Hes making a false distinction Mailin ballots are cast in the same way as absentee mail ballots with the same level of scrutiny such as signature verification in many states In more than 30 states and the District of Columbia voters have a right to “no excuse” absentee voting That means they can use mailin ballots for any reason regardless of whether a person is out of town or working In Florida the Legislature in 2016 voted to change the wording of such balloting from “absentee” to “votebymail” to make clear a voter can cast such ballots if they wish More broadly voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 000004 to 00009 based on studies of past elections Only nine states currently have plans for “universal” mailin voting where ballots are sent automatically to registered voters Five of those states relied on mailin ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person Blasting mailin voting Trump in the past week said he may hold up funding for the US Postal Service to impede those votes across the 50 states “Trump is simply wrong about mailin balloting raising a ‘tremendous’ potential for fraud” Richard L Hasen an elections expert at the University of California Irvine School of Law wrote recently “While certain pockets of the country have seen their share of absenteeballot scandals problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on votebymail including the heavily Republican state of Utah” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Sunday on CNNs “State of the Union” that Trump had requested a Florida absentee mail ballot to vote in November ——— ON BIDENHARRIS TRUMP asked about social media claims that Harris is not eligible to run for vice president because her parents were immigrants to the US “I heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements  I have no idea if that’s right I would have assumed that the Democrats would have checked that out” — news conference Thursday TRUMP asked about the subject again “I have nothing to do with it I read something about itHe added “It’s not something that bothers me  It’s not something that we will be pursuing” Asked point blank if Harris is eligible Trump replied “I just told you I have not got into it in great detail” — news conference Saturday THE FACTS Harris a senator from California is without question eligible Harris 55 was born in Oakland California making her a naturalborn US citizen and eligible to be president if Biden were unable to serve a full term Her father an economist from Jamaica and her mother a cancer researcher from India met at the University of California Berkeley as graduate students The Constitution requires a vice president to meet the eligibility requirements to be president That includes being a naturalborn US citizen at least 35 years old and a resident in the US for at least 14 years “I can’t believe people are making this idiotic comment” Laurence Tribe a Harvard University professor of constitutional law told The Associated Press in 2019 when similar false claims emerged about Harris during her presidential run “She is a natural born citizen and there is no question about her eligibility to run” Tribe said On Sunday Meadows said he accepted that Harris is eligible to serve as vice president “Sure” said Meadows when asked on CNN whether he acknowledges the fact that she meets the constitutional requirements to be president or vice president “And I think the president spoke to this yesterday This is not something that we’re going to pursue” Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket Trump in past years indulged in the false conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born abroad Only after mounting pressure during his 2016 campaign did Trump disavow the claims ——— TRUMP “If Biden would win  he’s going to double and triple everybody’s taxes” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS Trump is exaggerating Wildly so Biden would raise taxes primarily on the wealthy But a July estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget finds that the increase is a small fraction of what Trump claimed The former vice president’s plan would raise “taxes for the top 1 percent of earners by 13 to 18 of aftertax income while indirectly increasing taxes for most other groups by 02 to 06” the nonpartisan group said To put that in perspective tax collections would increase by 34 trillion to 37 trillion over the next decade That is a lot of money But it’s not a doubling or tripling The government is on pace to collect 47 trillion over the next decade so the Biden plan would be roughly be a 78 increase in revenues ——— TRUMP CAMPAIGN “Not long ago Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received”  statement Tuesday from Katrina Pierson Trump 2020 senior adviser THE FACTS She never called Biden a racist Pierson appears to be referring to Harris’ remarks during a Democratic primary debate in Miami in June 2019 when the California senator challenged Biden’s record of opposing busing as a way to integrate schools in the 1970s Harris prefaced her criticism by telling Biden at that time “I do not believe you are a racist I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground” She then went on “It was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country It was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools” Harris said “She was bused to school every day That little girl was me” It was a breakthrough moment for Harris at the candidates’ first debate stunning Biden who responded that “he did not praise racists” and provided a hairsplitting defense of his position on busing But she did not accuse him of being racist ——— ECONOMY TRUMP “The manufacturing sector is booming and the production index is at the highest reading since October of ’18 which was an extraordinary period of time” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS The pandemic crushed US factories and the damage persists There is no boom Even after three months of job gains the US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the manufacturing sector has 740000 fewer jobs than before the outbreak All the factory hiring gains under Trump have disappeared There were 257000 more manufacturing jobs on the day Trump became president than now More important the jobs recovery has shown signs of stalling Just 26000 factory jobs were added in July down from 357000 added jobs in June The sector has been recovering Yet after increases in production in June the Federal Reserve said US factory output was running 111 below prepandemic levels Trump cited one component of an index composed by the Institute for Supply Management that indicates factory production grew in July as well It was the best reading since August of 2018 not October as claimed by the president But that same report showed that manufacturers are also cutting back on employment suggesting that a boom has yet to begin ——— SOCIAL SECURITY TRUMP “At the end of the year the assumption that I win I’m going to terminate the payroll tax  We’ll be paying into Social Security through the general fund” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS Under Trump’s proposal Social Security would lose its dedicated funding source Payroll taxes raise about 1 trillion annually for Social Security and the president was unconcerned about the loss of those revenues Trump campaign officials stressed that the general fund consists of assets and liabilities that finance government operations and could do so for Social Security The general fund is nicknamed “America’s Checkbook” on the Treasury Department’s website The risk is that the loss of a dedicated funding source could destabilize an antipoverty program that provides payments to roughly 65 million Americans It also could force people to cut back on the spending that drives growth so they can save for their own retirement and health care needs if they believe the government backstop is in jeopardy A 124 payroll tax split between employers and workers funds Social Security while a 29 payroll tax finances Medicare The Social Security tax raised roughly 1 trillion last year according to government figures Over a 10year period Trump’s idea would blow a 13 trillion hole in a US budget that is already laden with rising debt loads Trump announced a payroll tax deferral through the end of the year part of a series of moves to bypass Congress after talks on a broader coronavirus relief bill that has stalled He says he will make it a permanent tax cut with the help of Congress Democrats have described that idea as a nonstarter White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday suggested to reporters that Trump misspoke when he said he would eliminate the payroll tax if reelected She said the president would only push to make the payroll tax deferrals permanent But Trump clearly said that he would eliminate the payroll tax four times at his Wednesday press briefing and even answered a question about “permanently” rescinding it ——— TRUMP asked how the general fund can sustain the payments “We’re going to have tremendous growth  You will see growth like you have not seen in a long time” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS It is highly unlikely that economic growth would be enough to offset the loss of the payroll tax Trump has a record of making wildly improbable growth projections He suggested that his 2017 income tax cuts would propel economic growth as high as 6 annually That never happened Growth reached 3 in 2018 then slumped to 22 and the US economy crumbled into recession this year because of the coronavirus ——— VIRUS THREAT TRUMP “You can’t compare it to 1917 That was incredible That was — that was the worst ever by far That was — you look at — they lost possibly 100 million people” — news conference Saturday TRUMP on COVID19 “Nobody understood it because nobody has ever seen anything like this The closest thing is in 1917 they say — right The great — the great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing where they lost anywhere from 50 to 100 million people Probably ended the Second World War all the soldiers were sick” — news briefing on Aug 10 THE FACTS He got the year wrong for the Spanish flu as he routinely does and may have overstated deaths from it The pandemic spread from early 1918 to late 1920 It killed an estimated 50 million worldwide with about 675000 of the deaths in the US according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention That pandemic did not end World War II which came two decades later ——— TRUMP “We’re still in the pandemic which will be going away as I say it will be going away And they scream how you can you say that I said because it’s going to be going away” — interview Thursday on Fox Business Network THE FACTS No matter how many times he says it the virus is not going to just magically disappear The virus is now blamed for more than 166000 deaths and more than 52 million confirmed infections in the US — easily the highest totals in the world In the past week the average number of new cases per day was on the rise in eight states and deaths per day were climbing in 26 according to an Associated Press analysis Dr Anthony Fauci the government’s top infectious diseases official has warned that increased cases across the South and West in particular put “the entire country at risk” On Thursday for instance the rate of positive virus cases in Texas soared to the highest levels of the pandemic with nearly 1 in every 4 coronavirus tests coming back positive Nevada had its biggest daily jump in coronavirus fatalities to date In February Trump asserted coronavirus cases were going “very substantially down not up” and said it will be fine because “in April supposedly it dies with the hotter weather” Fauci says there “certainly” will be coronavirus infections in the fall and winter ——— TRUMP on whether he still thinks kids are essentially immune from COVID19 “Yeah I think that for the most part they do very well I mean they — they don’t get very sick They don’t catch it easily” — news briefing Tuesday THE FACTS They aren’t immune and he ignores racial disparities among those kids who get infected Although it’s true that children are less likely than adults to develop COVID19 the CDC has nevertheless counted more than 250000 infections by the virus in Americans younger than 18 or roughly 7 of all cases Racial disparities in the US outbreak also extend to children with Hispanic and Black children with COVID19 more likely to be hospitalized than white kids The total number of kids who have been infected but not confirmed is almost certainly far higher than the CDC figures experts say because those with mild or no symptoms are less likely to get tested Trump also glosses over the fact that kids can spread disease without showing symptoms themselves The CDC in May also warned doctors to be on the lookout for a rare but lifethreatening inflammatory reaction in some children who’ve had the coronavirus The condition had been reported in more than 100 children in New York and in some kids in several other states and in Europe with some deaths Two recent government reports laid bare the racial disparities One of the CDC reports looked at children with COVID19 who needed hospitalization Hispanic children were hospitalized at a rate eight times higher than white kids and Black children were hospitalized at a rate five times higher it found The second report examined cases of the rare virusassociated syndrome in kids It found that nearly threequarters of the children with the syndrome were either Hispanic or Black well above their representation in the general population ——— NEW YORK VOTING TRUMP “Ballots are defrauded” — news conference Saturday TRUMP “You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race They should do that race over by the way  When you look at the ballot the ballots that are missing and the ballot frauds — nobody knows what’s going on with that race and yet they declared her a winner” — news conference Wednesday THE FACTS There’s no evidence of fraud in the Democratic congressional primary in New York City that was won by Democratic Rep Carolyn Maloney Nor did Trump offer any proof of fraud New York State decided to allow anyone to vote by mail in the June primary because of the pandemic More than 400000 people voted by absentee ballot in New York City a figure that was 10 times the number of absentee ballots cast in the 2016 primary Opening and counting those ballots by elections officials took weeks leading to a legal dispute over nonfraud issues such as missing postmarks Candidates observing the count say that thousands of ballots were disqualified because of technical errors voters wouldn’t have encountered if they had voted in person like problems with their signature New York City’s Board of Elections ultimately certified the results six weeks after the election ——— Associated Press writers Amanda Seitz in Chicago and Lauran Neergaard

{"1892": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening reversed himself on a key argument he made just the day before saying it would now be up to the governors of individual states to decide when their states would reopen amid the   and the federal government would be available to help oversee that process On Monday Trump had said he had total authority to make those decisions drawing rebukes from several governors including New York Democratic Gov Andrew Cuomo Speaking in the White House Rose Garden Trump said 20 states were in extremely good shape and some could reopen even before the end of April when the current federal social distancing guidelines are set to expire I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly and will then be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening  and a very powerful reopening plan of their state  at a time and in a manner as most appropriate Trump said He said governors would be responsible for the testing health experts have said is critical to avoid further spread and a possible new spike in cases Dr Anthony Fauci has suggested that a rolling reentry could be possible but   Tuesday that May 1 is a bit overly optimistic without widespread testing and contract tracing in place President Donald Trump opened Tuesday’s briefing in the White House Rose Garden by pointing to some counties across the country that he said don’t have reported cases of COVID19 appearing to lay the groundwork for reopening parts of the country We grieve at every precious life thats been lost to the invisible enemy but through the darkness we can see the rays of light Trump said Fifteen percent of counties within the United States have zero cases and many counties within the United States have a very small number of cases Large sections of our country are really looking at other sections and saying wow that looks bad but they dont have the problem he said Later after addressing other topics he turned back the countrys reopening he has promised predicting the day will be very close that some states will implement reopening saying that plans are close to being finalized He said hell speak to each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening  and a very powerful reopening plan of their state  at a time and in a manner as most appropriate The president said that some states could even reopen before the end of this month when the current federal social distancing guidelines expire Certain states  the day will be very close because certain states as you know are in a much different condition much different place than other states Its going to be very very close maybe even before the date May 1st Trump said Actually there are over 20 that are in extremely good shape and we think we will be able to get them open fairly quickly and then others will follow he said Frankly it will be at a time that will be earlier than the deadline we imposed the end of April Trump predicted So we think some of the governors will be in really good shape to open up even sooner than that Trumps comments saying decisions on reopening will be up to individual governors was a sharp reversal from what he said just the day before when he declared he had total authority  that he calls the shots when it comes to deciding how and when states can start lifting restrictions The governors will be very respectful of the presidency The presidency has such a great importance You can talk about Constitution you could talk about federalism you could talk about whatever you want He said governors will be responsible for the testing that health experts say is critical to stop further spread and that without it new spikes in cases could result We dont want to put pressure on anybody Im not going to say to Governor Cuomo that you have to open within seven days Trump said I want him to take his time and then open New York Im not putting any pressure on Some of them are ready to go And thats a good thing he added So we will open it up in beautiful pieces as it comes At the same time the president ended his news conference with a warning to governors if they dont do what he considers to be a good job reopening Lots of positive things are happening If the governors dont do a good job we will come down on them very hard Trump said Trump announced he was putting a hold on US funding for the World Health Organization a move he has signaled for weeks as he tries to shift blame for his response to the novel coronavirus pandemic Im instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the world health organizations role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus Trump said in an extended diatribe arguing the organization was against his travel ban to China They were very much opposed to what we did Fortunately I was not convinced and suspended travel from China saving untold numbers of lives he said The US is the largest donor to the world health agency by far and makes its contribution annually While Trump criticized the WHO for what he called a failure to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese governments official accounts the president had previously praised President Xi and China for their effort and transparency in handling the pandemic President Trump said that the scariest day of his life was about a month ago when he was told the nation had a possible ventilator shortage The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when after a long day of meetings my team told me that we were going to be needing 130000 ventilators but we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators Trump said He then shifted the blame to governors and the previous administration for the shortage This is the system we inherited And we look at the states the states were not prepared he said Would we be able to prevent Americans from dying because we couldnt get them ventilators I instructed my team to where heaven and Earth to make sure that this didnt happen Trump said In an   with the Associated Press Dr Anthony Fauci acknowledged Tuesday the country does not yet have the critical testing and contact tracing procedures needed to safely begin reopening the nations economy as the White House prepares to announce a council to do just that  and ahead of schedule according to the president We have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on and were not there yet Fauci told The AP He called the possibility of opening businesses by May 1 a bit overly optimistic for many areas of the country and repeated his suggestion that any easing off the social distancing guidelines should happen on a rolling basis Fauci also said the White House briefings can be really draining and signaled that his time might be better spent directing government research If I had been able to just make a few comments and then go to work that would have really been much better he said It isnt the idea of being there and answering questions which I really think is important for the American public Its the amount of time Its not uncommon for the presidents briefings to last more than two hours Echoing legislation that a bipartisan group of senators authored to protect special counsel Robert Mueller during the Russia investigation Sen Ed Markey DMass is looking to shield Fauci from being fired by President Trump for anything other than malfeasance neglect of office or incapacity We cannot allow Donald Trump to silence Dr Fauci or any other government scientists Markey said in a statement This legislation will close the hole in the law that currently allows the President to fire a National Institutes of Health Director such as Dr Fauci for any reason Educating the public about the science and the facts that will save lives is not and should never be a firing offense The   comes one day after the White House pushed back at new speculation that Faucis fate was at risk trying to tamp down questions raised after Trump himself he retweeted a tweet that included the hashtag FireFauci When senators proposed similar legislation to protect Mueller it surfaced significant constitutional concerns including separation of powers so its unclear if this would get bipartisan support After the president claimed his has total authority to set the terms of a nationwide reopening New York Gov Andrew Cuomo told CNN this morning If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state I wouldnt do it Hours later Trump went on Twitter to say that New York has been reliant on him in responding to the coronavirus in the nations hardesthit state but that now he seems to want Independence That wont happen Trump added Trump also tweeted this morning about one his alltime favorite movies the 1962 film Mutiny on the Bounty appearing to issue a metaphorical warning to the nation’s governors to follow in line The Constitution does not go out the window in an emergency said Cuomo in another phone interview with CNN after the presidents remarks Monday We dont have a king We have an elected president Even members of Trumps own party have acknowledged the president does not have total authority as he suggested Wyoming

{"2673": "After the city of Jacksonville Florida announced that masks will be mandatory for public and indoor locations starting Monday White House press secretary Kaleigh McEnany would not directly say if President   planned to wear one at his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention The event scheduled for August is expected to bring more than 40000 people from all over the country to Jacksonville and while the rules may apply to them its likely Trump will exempt himself I talked to the president before coming out here McEnany said Its his choice to wear a mask Its the personal choice of any individual as to whether to wear a mask or not He encourages people to make whatever decision is best for their safety but he did say to me he has no problem with masks and to do whatever your local jurisdiction requests of you Her rationale comes on the heels of a growing number of health officials urging the public to wear masks as cases rise alarmingly across the southern United States At the first public task force briefing in two months last Friday Vice President Mike Pence spent much of the time applauding the Trump administrations efforts and emphasizing how much worse the pandemic could have been without their response Coronavirus response coordinator Dr Deborah Birx meanwhile stressed the importance of wearing a mask When asked by ABC News Correspondent Kyra Phillips why Trumps campaign continues to hold rallies without mask or social distancing requirement despite public health advice Pence cited the Constitution The freedom of speech and the right to peacefully assemble is enshrined in the Constitution Pence said President Trump and I believe that taking proper steps as we created screening at recent events and giving people the very best counsel that we have We still want to give people the freedom to participate in the political process Pressed about how masks  or how the decision not to wear one  has become a political statement Pence would only say he encouraged Americans to follow state and local leaders For many people that wasnt enough Rep Liz Cheney RWyo House Republican Conference Chair and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney tweeted a photo of her masked father following the task force briefing accompanied by  the hashtag RealMenWearMasks House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also shared the sentiment to ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on This Week Sunday and voiced her support for a federal mask mandate Its definitely long overdue for that she said My understanding is that the Centers for Disease Control has recommended the use of masks but not required it because they dont want to offend the president Real men wear masks she added Its not about protecting yourself its about protecting others By Sunday afternoon Pence has changed his tune  somewhat In a trip to the hotspot state of Texas Pence and his team all arrived wearing masks as did Texas Gov Greg Abbott a Republican and his team to greet Pence on the tarmac In a later press conference Pence was more direct in echoing the advice of the health professionals seated beside him Wearing a mask is just a good idea Birx then stressed the importance of 100 compliance with mask orders in several counties as hospitalization rates increase particularly among younger adults with underlying health conditions Notably hours before Pence gave advice alongside Birx he spoke at a megachurch in Dallas with over 2000 congregants and a 100person choir   standing close and none wearing masks  though the Centers for Disease Control an Prevention has warned churches can be super spreader sites for one because of singing Despite the ramped up warnings Trump has signaled for months that he doesnt view masks as presidential and has resisted any pressure to be photographed in one in public I just dont want to wear one myself Its a recommendation I am feeling good Trump said at an April 3 coronavirus task force briefing I just dont want to be doing  I dont know somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk the great Resolute Desk I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents prime ministers dictators kings queens I dont know somehow I dont see it for myself Even as Trumps travels to more states where the coronavirus was spreading and more Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell say people ought to wear them and Sen Marco Rubio RFla said Everyone should just wear a damn mask Trump has resisted the pressure Although the White House says the president respects state and local mask mandates Trump himself seems to be the exception to those rules At a Fox News town hall in Wisconsin last week for instance all participants were required to wear masks to enter at the event  except for a sociallydistant Trump and Sean Hannity But Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Monday that without a mask someone may not be allowed into a business or venue This includes the Vystar Veterans Memorial Arena in Downtown Jacksonville where the RNC is scheduled for August We will continue to work on these plans as we get closer to the RNC he said It seems unlikely come August that the Republican National Committee will force their nominee to wear a mask in the megaindoor arena It seems more likely its a personal choice the president will do the same as hes done so far"},

before the launch was scrubbed due to bad weather Trump began his day on Twitter claiming Democrats and the news media are trying to make him look slow in responding to the pandemic and shifting focus to what he called a milestone  on testing Notably despite the US having completed the highest number of tests there are several countries with higher levels of testing per capita He met Wednesday morning in the Oval Office with New York Democratic Gov Andrew Cuomo who was photographed entering the White House wearing a mask something Trump has declined to do before cameras and has questioned why his political opponent   has done so As he continues his push to reopen the country when asked at an afternoon Rose Garden news conference on Tuesday what message he had for those flouting restrictions Trump replied Be safe saying nothing more declining to criticize them After President Trump and Vice President Pence made the trip to Florida to witness the historic launch of a SpaceX rocket carrying NASA astronauts the mission was scrubbed due to inclement weather When Trump arrived at the Kennedy Center he was asked if he had a message for the astronauts the president said good luck God be with you Its dangerous business but they are the best there is So we just want them to be safe he said After it was announced that the launch is being pushed to Saturday Trumps motorcade

unclear if the vice president and first family will join him again Although Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York a Democrat claimed his Wednesday meeting with President Donald Trump was not politically driven he didnt mince words in his criticism afterwards against some of Trumps allies on Capitol Hill declaring that good government is gone from America There is no good government concept anymore Its politics 365 days a year from the moment theyre elected to the moment they run again its all politics  and that is poison Cuomo said The governor said transportation and infrastructure funds along with relief resources for the state and local governments were the topics of his meeting with the president  but he mainly using his daily news conference this one from Washington to attack Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Congressional Republicans on partisan politics Nobody elected anyone to engage in partisan politics There was a time when as a nation we were smart enough to say you want to play politics Thats what a campaign is for Cuomo said Dont play your politics at the expense of the citizens you represent As he has previously Cuomo attacked McConnell for his previous comments against blue state bailouts and suggested its hypocrisy Why do they have their hand out every year Theyre against redistribution of wealth Thats what they all say Cuomo said pointing out as he has before that McConnells home state of Kentucky gets more federal funding annually than blue states like New York Kentucky takes out 138 billion more than they put in Cuomo said last month when McConnell suggested states should declare bankruptcy instead of receiving federal assistance Your state is getting bailed out  not my state While he acknowledged disagreements with Trump Cuomo said after their meeting Wednesday he believes the president is interested in stimulating the economy through largescale infrastructure projects and said their conversation stayed focused on supercharging the countrys reopening There are political differences between myself and the president You could go a google search and find 400 nasty tweets about political differences Personally I dont have a political agenda I said to the president when this first started was put the politics aside At the meeting we just had it was the same way It was about how do we supercharge the reopening especially in New York which was hardest hit Cuomo said Notably the governor and his aides were spotted entering the White House Wednesday morning wearing masks  an act the president continues to resist doing in public at least The governments top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci appearing on CNN Wednesday morning said that there is a good chance that a vaccine for coronavirus would be deployable by the end of the year I still think that we have a good chance  if all the things fall in the right place  that we might have a vaccine that would be deployable by the end of the year Fauci said He underscored that the process to develop a vaccine is not a smooth one There are a lot of landmines and hiccups that occur Fauci said The infectious disease expert also emphasized that the rapid development of a vaccine would not come at the expense of safety nor scientific integrity Asked about Frances ban of hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus treatment Fauci said hes not so sure it should be banned but clearly the scientific data is really quite evident now about the lack of efficacy He pointed out that recent studies had shown that dangerous side effects from hydroxychloroquine might be rare but youd see it adverse events particularly with regard to cardiovascular"},

this week Aichi Gov Hideaki Omura said onethird of about 300 new coronavirus cases in the prefecture have been confirmed in the past week as the infection spreads rapidly in the region making it the fifthmost infected prefecture in the country “The situation is critical” Omura said “We decided to do everything we can to protect Aichi residents’ lives and  ” Omura issued a request to all residents to stay home and work remotely until May 6 when the governmentissued state of emergency is to end Omura however did not request closures of nonessential businesses and facilities for now His announcement came just as Tokyo’s outspoken governor Yuriko Koike was to request closures of nonessential businesses and facilities in the city after agreeing with Abe’s government that had asked her to wait two weeks apparently to avoid impact on the economy Earlier on Friday leaders of Kyoto Japan’s ancient capital urged Abe to add that prefecture to part of the state of emergency to allow them

from early March when it was reporting around 500 new cases per day KCDC director Jeong Eunkyeong has raised the possibility of a broader “quiet spread” pointing to recent transmissions at bars and other leisure facilities that could indicate eased attitudes toward social distancing There’s also concern over a steady rise in infections linked to passengers arriving from overseas and at least dozens of cases where patients who had been diagnosed as recovered from COVID19 test positive for the second time after being released from hospitals South Korean Prime Minister Chung Syekyun on Friday urged health authorities to thoroughly investigate the possibility of reinfections saying the 74 patients who tested positive again so far account for more than 1 of national recoveries Health authorities have been cautious about discussing whether people could get reinfected after making a full recovery They say the country’s standard RTPCR tests designed to amplify the genetic materials

care workers and medical supplies the state needs Gov Gavin Newsom said Thursday The rate of all virus hospitalizations has slowed this week Those in the ICU need the highest level of care and so it was particularly encouraging that the number of patients in those rooms actually dropped 19 on Wednesday to 1132 The virus can cause severe breathing problems and ventilators are a key tool in keeping

chief medical officer Robert Hart said they expect antibody testing to be available in a couple of weeks “We look forward to being one of the first centers in the country that will be doing antibody testing” Thomas said during a telephone news conference Thursday “Which basically will allow us to test without someone necessarily having symptoms We’ll be able to tell whether they have or have had COVID19” “That’s going to be a huge benefit” Hart said “It’s going to tell us if someone has had the disease in the past and already has immunity to the disease” Hart said it’s of major importance given that some never suffer symptoms after being infected “We’re having everyone take precautions right now and there is a subset of people who already had the disease that do not have to be worried about contracting the disease again” said Hart although he added the length of time such immunity would last is uncertain Such testing will help ease the minds of any Ochsner employees found to have already had the disease as they continue to work with patients Hart said “We’ve been told it may be the middle of the month a couple of weeks before we have that available” Hart added later “That’s going to help us certainly as we think about our population and the social distancing to begin to do other things” Hart said while stressing that social distancing must continue for now It was not

The UN chief spoke at a closed council meeting on COVID19 — the first by the UN’s most powerful body which has made no statement on the pandemic Gutteres whose remarks were released by the UN spokesman said the engagement of the Security Council will be “critical to mitigate the peace and security implications of the COVID19 pandemic” He added that “a signal of unity and resolve from the Council would count for a lot at this anxious time” But diplomats said the 15 council members could not immediately agree on a statement to the media The secretarygeneral reiterated that the United Nations faces “its gravest test” since the organization was founded 75 years ago and concluded saying “This is the fight of a generation — and the raison d’être of the reason for the United Nations itself” Other threats to global peace cited by Guterres were the erosion of trust in public institutions economic instability political tensions from postponing elections or referenda uncertainty leading parties in some countries to promote further division and turmoil and the pandemic “triggering or exacerbating various human rights challenges” ——— NEW YORK — As New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space the city has shortened the amount of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in the city’s public cemetery Under the new

are keep children healthy and safe reach vulnerable children with water sanitation and hygiene keep children learning support families to cover their needs and care for their children protect children from violence exploitation and abuse and protect refugee and migrant children and those affected by conflict ——— UNITED NATIONS — More than 60 UN agencies and international organizations are urging governments to take immediate steps to address the unfolding global recession and financial crisis wrought by the coronavirus pandemic especially in the world’s poorest countries The United Nationsled InterAgency Task Force on Financing for Development said “Billions of people live in countries teetering on the brink of economic collapse due to the explosive mix of financial shocks fueled by the COVID19 pandemic heavy debt obligations and declining official development assistance” The 207page report launched Thursday by the task force said before the COVID19 crisis one in five countries —

imposed He also said the transmission of the coronavirus within the community may now be “shrinking” And Professor Chris Whitty the government’s chief medical adviser also noted that the time it takes for the number of people in intensive care to double has got steadily longer over the past couple of weeks from three days to six or more now and “extending in time” However the number of people dying after testing positive for COVID19 disease is set to carry on an upward trajectory for a couple of weeks in light of the lags involved Vallance said Government figures earlier showed that the UK

could cost at least 4500 lives and a government agency announced the Canadian economy lost 1011000 jobs in March Trudeau says the country is in the early stage of the outbreak because the virus came

around the world work in the informal economy earning less saving less and at greater risk of falling into poverty” He said millions of women’s jobs have been lost at the same time that their unpaid

there’s precedent with other infections like influenza that “when the virus gets warmer that the virus goes down in its ability to replicate to spread” But Fauci added “having said that one should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing If we get some help from the weather so be it fine But I don’t think we need to assume that” He was asked about the New York Times story that research indicates the coronavirus that began circulating in New York in midFebruary came mainly from Europe not Asia “I think that’s probably correct” Fauci said He notes that “Europe became the epicenter pretty quickly after China really exploded with their cases” ——— Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at

{"7721": "The White House is signaling a renewed interest in negotiations with Congress over the next   stimulus relief package after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi vowed to keep the House in session until a deal with Republicans and the administration is hammered out President Trump on Wednesday urged Republicans to embrace a larger coronavirus stimulus package seemingly stepping on the Republicans more conservative approach as the major parties continue to struggle to break a stalemate over a fifth relief bill Democrats are heartless They dont want to give STIMULUS PAYMENTS to people who desperately need the money and whose fault it was NOT that the plague came in from China Go for the much higher numbers Republicans it all comes back to the USA anyway one way or another Trump tweeted The White House is specifically honing in on a longshot plan put forth by the House Problem Solvers Caucus a bipartisan group consisting of 50 members Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Trump is open to the caucus proposed 15 trillion stimulus package that was introduced earlier this week in an effort to break a monthslong deadlock Im probably more optimistic in the last 72 hours than in the last 72 days Meadows said Wednesday on current negotiations He called the bipartisan caucus proposed plan very thoughtful and said that if Pelosi is willing to stay in session until a deal is reached that one could be made I think probably the biggest obstacle continues to be the amount of money that is outlined for state and local help Meadows said The proposal from the bipartisan caucus is largely symbolic and some members have privately acknowledged it has little chance of passing Several Democratic committee chairs rejected the proposal outright and said it falls short of what is needed Having seen no progress on a new COVID19 relief package in four months and in recognition of Americans increasing suffering the Problem Solvers Caucus PSC has developed a comprehensive bipartisan framework to meet the nations needs for the next 612 months that can pass both chambers of Congress and be signed into law by the President the caucus said in a release The caucuss proposal includes 450 per week in federal unemployment benefits for eight weeks 500 billion in state and local relief direct payments to American workers and additional Paycheck Protection Program funds Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that they were encouraged by the Trump administrations recent overtures We are encouraged that after months of the Senate Republicans insisting on shortchanging the massive needs of the American people President Trump is now calling on Republicans to go for the much higher numbers in the next coronavirus relief package Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement We look forward to hearing from the Presidents negotiators that they will finally meet us halfway with a bill that is equal to the massive health and economic crises gripping our nation By the end of the week 200000 Americans will have died from the coronavirus The lives and livelihoods of the American people depend on Republicans abandoning their obsession with doing as little as possible while the coronavirus rages through our nation they said But a short a time after Trump tweeted his press secretary quickly stepped in and said Trump was referring to a skinny bill proposed by Senate Republicans that failed to pass in a vote late last week What the president was referring to was the 500 billion bill that passed the Senate the Phase 4 plan that …  got 50 votes in the Senate Its that 500 billion skinny proposal but it didnt include direct payments So he wants more than the 500 billion dollars and he is very keen to see these direct stimulus payments

would be hesitant to make a commitment about a level that is that high Im really concerned about funds that have been appropriated and havent been spent yet I think the real solution to this is weve got to get the economy going again she added On Tuesday Pelosi told members of the Democratic caucus on a private phone call that the House will remain in session until Congress passes another coronavirus relief bill per sources on the call We are committed to staying here until we have an agreement an agreement that meets the needs of the American people Pelosi said during an interview with CNBC on Tuesday shortly after the caucus call  Were optimistic that the White House at least will understand that we have to do some things House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer later reiterated to reporters that the House will likely remain on a 24hour recall throughout the month of October in case a deal is reached and members will be called back for a vote This comes as a number of moderate Democrats are growing anxious and jittery over the lack of coronavirus relief for their ailing communities just weeks ahead of the election and several months after Congress passed its last major bill to address the public health crisis Pelosi and Hoyer are facing criticism from some moderate Democrats about their handling of the impasse over coronavirus relief Some members of the New Democratic

my constituents they dont ask me why Mitch McConnell isnt doing anything Rep Kathleen Rice DNY said according to a source familiar with the call  They ask me what our Democratic majority is doing to work around him Pelosi  who clashed with Rice over the speakership in 2018  encouraged her to poll her colleagues on whether they wanted to stay in town until reaching a deal with the White House I am following my convictions and my conviction is to actually do my goddamn job and come up with a solution for the American people Rep Abigail Spanberger DVirginia a freshman from a Republicanleaning district in Virginia said on the call in response to a colleague who urged Democrats to hold out against Republicans After some discussion of being in Washington rather than at home Pelosi told members she would be in Washington regardless of the House schedule deferring to Hoyer on whether the House would stay in session according to Democrats familiar with the call Caucus leadership is polling members of the group to get a better sense of whether they will remain in Washington until a deal is made or return home to their districts instead What came through loud and clear was a unanimous desire to see Congress take action to help our constituents Rep Derek Kilmer DWashington the chair of the group told ABC News declining to comment on specifics of the conversation Time is short the needs are urgent the suffering is immense and trading zero for less than what we had aspired is not a reasonable alternative Rep Dean Phillips DMinnesota said The caucus is having a robust conversation publicly and privately about how to proceed and most importantly that we must proceed he said The House passed a 34 trillion stimulus measure in May but Republicans rejected it as being too costly Senate Republicans pushed for what they call a skinny bill that would provide just 350 billion in new spending but Pelosi has insisted Democrats will not accept anything less than 22 trillion A skinny deal is not a deal Pelosi privately told Democrats Tuesday morning It is a Republican bill Asked by CNBC if shed be willing to pass a skinny deal now and reconvene with Republicans on outstanding issues later Pelosi said there is no later with this administration This is the opportunity And the skinny deal is a Republican bill  thats not a deal at all Pelosi said Theyre making a skinny  in fact Chuck Schumer and I call it an emaciated  proposal for a massive problem We can fiscally spend the appropriate amount of money to meet the needs of the American people she added And by the way its stimulus We are a consumer economy and the more we have whether its food stamps or unemployment insurance  that is stimulus to the economy Democratic Rep Stephanie Murphy of Florida was

{"2521": "NEW YORK  Before President   stepped into the White House briefing room to provide an update on         the coronavirus an opening act was broadcast across cable news of another chief executive calmly reciting statistics and safety tips For the second straight day New York Gov Andrew Cuomos matteroffact and slightly scolding demeanor from an epicenter of the pandemic was a stark contrast Thursday to the often haphazard and hyperbolic messages coming from Trump “I tell my daughters Make decisions based on risk versus reward” the Democrat said at his Thursday briefing “For young people to go out in crowds on spring break is so unintelligent and reckless I cant even begin to express it Stay home Stop the spread Save lives” Through daily briefings and scores of media appearances Cuomo has emerged as one of the key faces responding to         the pandemic He is one of         several governors thrust into the spotlight as cases surge forcing a reordering of American life without schools sporting events or large crowds The decisions to cancel events and help overburdened hospitals have often fallen to governors like Ohio’s Mike DeWine a Republican who         postponed the state’s primary this week and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer a Democrat who drew Trump’s ire for criticizing the federal response But it has been Cuomo’s daily briefings that have become mustsee TV Twice this week the White House’s own coronavirus briefing was delayed until Cuomo concluded his own update providing vital information to a public largely shut in at home televisions anxiously tuned to cable news His appearances drew praise from some unlikely sources “I continue to be impressed with the briefings given by realDonaldTrump and his worldclass experts” tweeted Rudy Giuliani the president’s personal attorney “Similarly my Governor Andrew Cuomo who is keeping us well informed” Meanwhile an unexpected online fan club has popped up full of adoring Twitter posts during the governor’s briefings and one Jezebel article Thursday titled “Help I Think Im In Love With Andrew Cuomo” It’s a remarkable show of affection for a governor who has long been more respected than loved one who is in his third term in an overwhelmingly Democratic state yet has never been embraced by the party’s liberal base who at times have grown frustrated with his centrist approach He has twice toyed with running for president but never launched a campaign Still his very public tactics have positioned him as the Democratic counter to Trump even as the party begins to coalesce around Joe Bidens presidential campaign Biden who has a nearly insurmountable delegate lead in the Democratic contest has largely kept a low profile limited to short speeches remarks and other events livestreamed to supporters who are being advised to stay home for the foreseeable future As Cuomo conducts briefings from the state capital in Albany he has vacillated between being Trump’s foil and his unlikely ally The two Queens natives have traded barbs on Twitter while also conferring in latenight phone calls placed from the White House residence Just had a very good teleconference with Nations Governors Went very well Cuomo of New York has to ‘do more’ Trump tweeted Monday A short time later Cuomo responded I have to do more No  YOU have to do something Youre supposed to be the President But the two men spoke several times the next few days and Cuomo made a point in national television interviews of expressing his appreciation for Trump’s responsiveness even as he urged the federal government to do more “The best news is I think the federal government has now really gotten this and theyre engaged” Cuomo said Thursday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” “I said to the president you step up you help my state you help my people you help this country and I will put my hand out in partnership 100 because politics be darned right now right” The president hours later from the White House briefing room noted the comment saying “Andrew Cuomo is being very very generous saying such nice things about us” Cuomo has steered his state through crisis before including the devastation wrought by Superstorm Sandy in 2012 He has long been drawn to proposing sweeping government projects and taking a handson approach to emergency responses He worked for his father threeterm Gov Mario Cuomo and oversaw the response to numerous disasters as secretary of housing and urban development for President Bill Clinton He long has feuded with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio a fellow Democrat who once worked for Cuomo at HUD Ruthless when wielding political power Cuomo has at times appeared to quash de Blasios policy proposals out of sport and the two men have continued their rivalry during the coronavirus crisis Cuomo upstaged and undermined de Blasio by ordering the citys schools to close mere minutes before the mayor was set to make the announcement and this week the governor took pains to rebut the mayors plan for the nations largest city to shelter in place during the worst of the outbreak Cuomos performance this week to some echoed how another polarizing New York politician commanded the national stage when the commanderinchief was missing in action Giuliani then mayor of New York City was the face of American grief and resolve on Sept 11 2001 when President George W Bush was being scrambled to safety on Air Force One in the hours after the terror attacks Cuomo’s leadership this week has been reminiscent of Giuliani in that moment of American worry according to George Arzt a New York Democratic consultant who was Mayor Ed Koch’s press secretary and has worked with both Cuomo and Trump “People are yearning for leadership and they are not getting it from the Oval Office” said Arzt “Andrew really does well in a crisis And here he is someone taking the lead and showing on the state level what needs to be done nationally” ———

press briefing on Tuesday without any of his administrations health experts present When asked to clarify why health experts like Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci are not attending the briefings the president said he spoke with Fauci and noted  for the second day in a row  that Birx was right outside the briefing room The president added that they were giving him everything they know of as of this point in time Im giving the information to you and I think its probably a very concise way of doing it Trump said It seems to be working out very well The information the president discussed   did not appear to fully echo what his own health experts recently indicated While the president told ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl that he would be comfortable with his son and grandchildren returning to school in person he also inaccurately claimed that his administration had a national strategy for schools reopening The current recommendations from the federal government including the White House and the CDC provide varying levels of guidance rather than presenting a broad national plan Meanwhile the onus of figuring out the details involved with the reopenings have largely been put on local officials Just last week Fauci said that the default action should be for schools to reopen and local health officials should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines Trump had called those guidelines very tough and expensive On Wednesday the president also   that children do not transmit or catch the virus easily If they do catch

{"5869": "WASHINGTON  By the time President   first spoke publicly about the         coronavirus it may already have been too late Interviewed at Davos a gathering of global elites in the Swiss Alps the president on Jan 22 played down the threat posed by the respiratory virus from China which had just reached American shores in the form of a solitary patient in Washington state “We have it totally under control” Trump said on CNBC “It’s one person coming in from China and we have it under control It’s going to be just fine” In the 11 weeks since that interview the coronavirus has reached every corner of the globe It has infected more than 500000 Americans and killed at least 20000 It has rewritten the rules of society isolated people in their homes closed schools devastated the economy and put millions out of work When Trump spoke in Switzerland weeks’ worth of warning signs already had been raised In the ensuing month before the president first addressed the crisis from the White House key steps to prepare the nation for the coming pandemic were not taken Lifesaving medical equipment was not stockpiled Travel largely continued unabated Vital public   data from China was not provided or was deemed untrustworthy A White House riven by rivalries and turnover was slow to act Urgent warnings were ignored by a president consumed by his impeachment trial and intent on protecting a robust economy that he viewed as central to his reelection chances Twenty current and former administration officials and Republicans close to the White House were interviewed for this account about the critical weeks lost before the president spoke to the nation on Feb 26 Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions ——— ‘MYSTERIOUS PNEUMONIA’ On New Year’s Eve China informed the World Health Organization of a “mysterious pneumonia outbreak” spreading through Wuhan an industrial city of 11 million The government closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak moved all patients with the virus to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to government laboratories Doctors were told to stay quiet one who issued a warning online was punished He later died of the virus The Pentagon first learned about the new coronavirus in December from open source reports emanating from China By early January warnings about the virus had made their way into intelligence reports circulating around the government On Jan 3 the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Robert Redfield received a call from his Chinese counterpart with an official warning Dr Anthony Fauci the governments top infectious disease expert was alerted to the virus around the same time — and within two weeks was fearful it could bring global catastrophe Quickly US intelligence and public health officials began doubting Chinas reported rates of infection and death toll They pressed China to allow in US epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the US response US officials also pressed China to send samples of the virus to US labs for study and for vaccine and test development On Jan 11 China shared the virus’ genetic sequence That same day the National Institutes of Health started working on a vaccine Ultimately the US was able to get China’s consent to send two people on the WHO team that traveled to China later in the month But by then precious weeks had been lost and the virus had raced across Asia and had begun to escape the continent ——— BALANCING ACT For much of January administration officials were doing a delicate balancing act Internally they were raising alarms about the need to get Americans on the ground in China Publicly they were sending words of encouragement and praise in hopes Beijing would grant the Americans access Matthew Pottinger Trumps deputy national security adviser persistently urged more aggressive action in calling out China and sending teams there But while word of the virus was included in several of the president’s intelligence briefings Trump wasn’t fully briefed on the threat until Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called with an update on Jan 18 while the president was at his private MaraLago club in Florida Trump spent much of the conversation wanting to talk about vaping he was considering a new policy restricting its use White House officials now believe Trump didn’t fully grasp the magnitude of the threat to the US in part because Azar who was feuding with several members of Trump’s inner circle did a poor job communicating it Azar was trying to walk a fine line between Trump’s upbeat statements and preparing the government for what might lie ahead “America’s risk is low at the moment” he later told House lawmakers “That could change quickly” Moreover the president was in the middle of his Senate impeachment trial and focused on little else punctuating nearly every White House meeting with complaints about the Democrats out to get him grievances he would continue late into the night on the phone from his private quarters Trump also had little desire to pressure Beijing or criticize its president Xi Jinping with whom he wanted to secure cooperation on ending a yearlong trade war before the reelection campaign kicked into high gear When Trump fielded his first question about the virus in Davos he enthusiastically praised Xi’s response going well beyond the calibrated riskreward messaging his aides were encouraging ——— INFIGHTING The West Wing was adrift By late January acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held the post in name only as rumors swirled of his impending postimpeachment departure He was on the initial coronavirus task force which was plagued with infighting At the same time the White House Office of Management and Budget was clashing with Azars HHS over money to combat the virus HHS wanted to send a special coronavirus funding request to Congress but the White House budget office resisted for weeks insisting that HHS should instead repurpose 250 million of its existing budget to bolster the national stockpile by buying protective equipment HHS however claimed that without congressional authorization it could not buy the needed quantities of masks gowns and ventilators to rapidly bolster the national stockpile Eventually an initial request went to Congress for 25 billion in virus aid an amount that lawmakers of both parties dismissed as too low The bill that Congress quickly passed and Trump signed — the first of three so far — was for 8 billion Even as the two agencies fought there was no influential voice in Trump’s orbit pushing him to act swiftly on the pandemic Trump had surrounded himself with loyalists and few in the administration including national security adviser Robert OBrien were able to redirect the presidents attention In midJanuary meetings were being held at the White House but the focus was on getting US government employees back from China which was still playing down how contagious the virus was A Jan 29 memo from senior White House aide Peter Navarro accurately predicted some of the challenges faced by the US from what would become a pandemic though he was hardly the first to sound the alarm But he like Pottinger was viewed by others in the White House as a “China hawk” and their concerns were rejected by others in the administration who did not bring them to the president On Jan 30 the WHO declared the virus a global health emergency while Trump held a packed campaign rally in Iowa The next day the Trump administration banned admittance to the United States by foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the past 14 days excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents Trump styled it as bold action but continued to talk down the severity of the threat Despite the ban nearly 40000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since that date according to an analysis by The New York Times The White House denied that it was slow to act “While the media and Democrats refused to seriously acknowledge this virus in January and February said spokesman Judd Deere “President Trump took bold action to protect Americans and unleash the full power of the federal government to curb the spread of the virus expand testing capacities and expedite vaccine development when we had no true idea the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread ——— VERY VERY READY On Feb 10 Trump stood before thousands of supporters packed into a New Hampshire rally and declared “By April you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away The crowd roared its approval at Trump’s unproven assertion The Senate had acquitted Trump on the impeachment charges and the president shifted his focus toward reelection even as others in the administration keyed in on the virus Federal officials put the CDC solely in charge of developing a test for the virus and left out private interests a choice that cost precious time when the resulting CDC test proved faulty Trump spent many weeks shuffling responsibility for leading his administration’s response to the crisis He put Azar in charge of the administrations virus task force before replacing him with Vice President Mike Pence toward the end of February Even as the virus spread across the globe prevailing voices in the White House including senior adviser Jared Kushner and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged the president to avoid big steps that could roil financial markets The president had firmly linked his fate to Wall Street and it took a tumble by the markets for Trump to ratchet up his response In late February while Trump was on a trip to India the Dow Jones plummeted 1000 points amid rising fears about the coronavirus Trump stewed about the collapse on his Feb 26 flight back to Washington and lashed out at aides over comments made by a top CDC official Dr Nancy Messonnier during a briefing the prior day when she warned Americans that they would have to prepare for fairly severe social distancing “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen” she said The White House announced that Pence would brief the media about the response that night But Trump took the podium instead and has not relinquished the stage much since belatedly making himself the face of the battle against the virus When Trump first took the lectern in the White House briefing room to speak about the virus the US had 15 coronavirus patients “We’re at that very low level and we want to keep it that way Trump said “We’re very very ready for this ——— Lemire reported from New York Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann Kevin Freking and Lauran Neergaard

{"555": "WASHINGTON  Explaining his deceptive assurances about the pandemic President   suggested he was doing what Winston Churchill had done soothing the public in a time of danger Thats not how it went down in World War II Churchill did not tell Britons that Nazi Germany was “under control ” or that like a miracle it will disappear” to cite Trumps words on the virus The British prime minister spread fear as well as resolve as he summoned Britons to national purpose against the “hideous apparatus of aggression” enslaving swaths of Europe and soon to be “turned upon us” Trumps statements about the pandemic have been rife with misinformation from the start But journalist Bob Woodwards new book “Rage” reveals Trump admitting to using distortion as a tactic as he underplayed the threat of COVID19 to Americans and young people in particular while knowing better The president said his purpose was to avoid panic Details from the book and its recorded interviews with Trump dropped during a week of intense politicking as the campaign for the Nov 3   entered its homestretch As the rhetoric flew both Trump and Democratic rival   exaggerated their influence in reviving the auto industry In a mixup Biden vastly overstated military COVID19 deaths Trump thoroughly misrepresented Bidens positions BLOOD SWEAT TEARS TRUMP on Churchill during the German bombing of London “He always spoke with calmness He said ‘We have to show calmness — remarks to Michigan supporters Thursday TRUMP “As the British government advised the British people in the face of World War II ‘Keep calm and carry on’ That’s what I did — Michigan remarks THE FACTS Historians take sharp issue with that “Churchill understood that candor in crisis was vital” tweeted Erik Larson author of “The Splendid and the Vile” a history of Churchill and Britons during the German bombing campaign known as the Blitz ”He did not sugarcoat the German threat” Fellow historian Jon Meacham responded to Trump with a quote from Churchill himself rendered with Twitter abbreviation “The British people can face any misfortune w fortitude  buoyancy as long as they are convinced that those in charge of their affairs are not deceiving them or are not dwelling in a fool’s paradise The slogan to “Keep calm and carry on” was printed on British posters in preparation for war but         did not gain favor  and the posters were soon scrapped In his first BBC broadcast as prime minister in May 1940 Churchill         described in chilling detail the “remarkable” advance of German armored columns and infantry through the ravaged French countryside and said it would be foolish “to disguise the gravity of the hour” He said “that hideous apparatus of aggression which gashed Holland into ruin and slavery in a few days will be turned upon us I am sure I speak for all when I say we are ready to face it to endure it” The Blitzkrieg started that September While Trump was repeatedly minimizing the danger of the outbreak in his public remarks he was telling Woodward that he knew the virus was deadlier than even a severe seasonal flu that he was struck by how easily it spread and that “plenty of young people” were contracting it “I wanted to always play it down he said in March I still like playing it down Because I don’t want to create a panic” ——— VIRUS TRUMP “We are going to have vaccines very soon it may be much sooner than you think” — news conference Thursday TRUMP “You’ll have this incredible vaccine and  in speed like nobody has ever seen before This could’ve taken two or three years and instead it’s going to be — it’s going to be done in a very short of period of time Could even have it during the month of October” — news conference Monday THE FACTS He’s almost certainly raising unrealistic hopes as the November   approaches The Food and Drug Administration already has told manufacturers it won’t consider any vaccine that’s less than 50 effective Getting the right math before November as Trump has promised is “incredibly unlikely” said Dr Larry Corey of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute who is overseeing the US government’s vaccine studies Public health experts are worried that Trump will press the FDA to approve a vaccine before it is proven to be safe and effective Dr Anthony Fauci the government’s top infectious diseases expert has said he is “cautiously optimistic” that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready by early next year Even then Fauci made clear that the vaccine would not be widely available right away “Ultimately within a reasonable period of time the plans now allow for any American who needs a vaccine to get it within the year 2021” Fauci told Congress last month Dr Francis Collins the director of the National Institutes of Health also expressed “cautious optimism” this past week that one of the vaccines being tested will pan out by years end But he warned “Certainly to try to predict whether it happens on a particular week before or after a particular date in early November is well beyond anything that any scientist right now could tell you” The “particular date” is Nov 3 Election Day ——— TRUMP “The approach to the virus is a very unscientific blanket lockdown by the Democrats” — news conference Thursday TRUMP “Biden’s plan for the China virus is to shut down the entire US economy” — news conference Monday THE FACTS That’s not Bidens plan at all Biden has said he would shut down the economy only if scientists and public health advisers recommended he do so to stem the COVID19 threat He said he would follow the science not disregard it Biden told ABC last month he “will be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives” when he was asked if he would even be willing to shut the country again “I would listen to the scientists he said If they said to shut it down “I would shut it down ——— TRUMP “When Joe Biden was vice president his failed approach to the swine flu was disastrous  And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time We did everything wrong it was a disaster” — news conference Thursday THE FACTS This is a distorted history of a pandemic in 2009 that killed far fewer people in the United States than the coronavirus is killing now For starters Biden as vice president wasn’t running the federal response And that response was faster out of the gate than when COVID19 came to the US Then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s flu surveillance network sounded the alarm after two children in California became the first people diagnosed with the new flu strain in this country About two weeks later the Obama administration declared a public health emergency against H1NI also known as the swine flu and the CDC began releasing antiflu drugs from the national stockpile to help hospitals get ready In contrast Trump declared a state of emergency in early March seven weeks after the first US case of COVID19 was announced and the countrys health system struggled for months with shortages of critical supplies and testing More than 190000 people have died from COVID19 in the US The CDC puts the US death toll from the 20092010 H1N1 pandemic at about 12500 ——— AUTOS BIDEN “President Obama and I rescued the auto industry and helped Michigan’s economy come roaring back — tweet Wednesday THE FACTS Biden is assigning too much credit to Barack Obama and himself for saving the auto industry As an initial matter what the Obama administration did was an expansion of pivotal steps taken by Obama’s predecessor President George W Bush In December 2008 General Motors and Chrysler were on the brink of financial collapse The US was in a deep recession and US auto sales were falling sharply GM Chrysler and Ford requested government aid but Congress voted it down With barely a month left in office Bush authorized 25 billion in loans to GM and Chrysler from the 700 billion bailout fund that was initially intended to save the largest US banks Ford decided against taking any money Once in office Obama appointed a task force to oversee GM and Chrysler both of which eventually declared bankruptcy took an additional roughly 55 billion in aid and were forced to close many factories and overhaul their operations All three companies recovered and eventually started adding jobs again ——— TRUMP “We brought you a lot of car plants you know that right  I saved the US auto industry — Michigan rally Thursday BIDEN on Michigans economy Donald Trump squandered it — and hardworking Michiganders are paying the price every day” —tweet Wednesday THE FACTS Both Trump and Biden are overstating it Trump did not wreck Michigan’s economy but he certainly didnt bring an auto industry boom either In fact the number of auto and parts manufacturing jobs in the state         fell slightly between Trumps inauguration and February of this year before the coronavirus took hold When Trump took office there were 174200 such jobs and that dropped to 171800 in February according to         Labor Department statistics While most plants shuttered for about eight weeks after the pandemic hit many are back running near capacity again at least for now In July the most recent figures

from Moody’s Analytics and CNN ——— ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT TRUMP “Instead of focusing on radical ideology my administration is focused on delivering real results And that’s what we have Right now we have the cleanest air ever we’ve ever had in this country — let’s say over the last 40 years” — remarks Tuesday in Jupiter Florida FACTS He’s not responsible for all of the progress — far from it All six air pollution measurements monitored by the US Environmental Protection Agency         showed that in 2019 the US air was the cleanest on record But the most important pollutant tiny particles was essentially about the same as 2016 only down 1 according to Carnegie Mellon University environmental engineering professor Neil Donahue The same figures also showed that air pollution rose in the first two years of the Trump administration before falling greatly in 2019 Donahue and three other outside experts in air pollution said the president was wrongly taking credit for what years even decades of everincreasing emissions restrictions caused H Christopher Frey an engineering professor at North Carolina State University and former chief of the EPA’s air quality scientific advisory board said that “current trends in air quality are for reasons irrespective of or despite policies of the Trump administration” Instead he and Donahue attributed it to a shift from use of dirtier coal — a shift the Trump administration has fought against — and to newer cleaner cars replacing older vehicles ——— TRUMP “We’re showing that we can create jobs safeguard the environment and keep energy prices low for America and low for our citizens And you see that You also see it when you pump the gas in your car and you’re sometimes paying a lot less than 2 lately So we’re doing well” — Florida remarks THE FACTS Trump is wrongly taking credit Gasoline prices didn’t fall because of the Trump administration They plunged because the coronavirus forced people to abandon their offices schools business trips and vacations “Reduced economic activity related to the COVID19 pandemic has caused changes in energy demand and supply patterns in 2020 said the US Energy Information Administration World demand for oil has fallen by 8 million barrels a day the agency estimates Underscoring the connection to the pandemic shutdown US gas prices were at their lowest in April when people were staying home most now are up 33 cents a gallon on average the agency says ——— TROOPS TRUMP “We’re pretty much out of Syria” — news conference Thursday THE FACTS Not so much Last year close to 30 US troops moved out of two outposts near the border area where a Turkish attack on the country was initially centered But the US currently has about 700 troops deployed to Syria a number that hasnt changed a lot lately ——— BIDEN “Troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan 6922  Military COVID deaths 6114 Folks every one of these lives mattered” — remarks Wednesday in Warren Michigan THE FACTS He’s way off on the number of coronavirus deaths in the US military According to the         Defense Department just seven members of the military have died from COVID19 including reservists and those in the National Guard The Biden campaign acknowledged he had misspoken citing overall coronavirus deaths in Michigan instead of US military deaths in a mixup ——— NATO TRUMP “If you look at NATO with the exception of eight countries — we’re one of them — every country is way behind They’re delinquent especially Germany in paying their NATO bills  And they’ve increased their spending now 130 billion going up to 400 billion a year It’s all because of me” — news conference Monday THE FACTS Hes incorrect on several fronts First countries don’t pay to be in NATO and don’t owe the organization anything other than contributions to a largely administrative fund that Trump is not talking about Member countries are not delinquent on NATO bills Nor have collections increased as he asserted Trump’s actual beef is with how much NATO countries spend on their own military budgets Hes pressed them to spend more So did Obama And in 2014 during the Obama administration NATO members agreed to move “toward” spending 2 of their gross domestic product on their own defense by 2024 Trump then mangles what happened next In December NATO SecretaryGeneral Jens Stoltenberg announced that by 2024 military spending by nonUS members of the alliance will have increased by 400 billion since 2016 because of commitments from the member states Thats 400 billion cumulatively over eight years Its not “400 billion a year as Trump put it And its not “all because of me” ——— NOVEMBER ELECTION TRUMP retweeting          an Associated Press analysis projecting the number of ballots that get rejected will soar this fall because of increased mailin voting “Rigged Election” — tweet Tuesday THE FACTS No defective ballots do not equate to fraud The overwhelming majority aren’t According to the Brennan Center for Justice the vast majority of ballots are disqualified because they arrive late a particular worry this year because of recent US Postal Service delays and an expected surge in mailin voting during the coronavirus pandemic Ballots also are deemed defective if there is a missing signature — common with newer voters unfamiliar with the process — or it doesn’t match what’s on file In addition some states require absentee voters to get a witness or notary to sign their ballots “None of those are fraud” said Wendy Weiser director of Brennan’s democracy program at NYU School of Law When suspected cases are investigated for potential fraud studies have borne out the main reason for defects is voter mistake The AP analysis published Monday found that rejections of absentee ballots could triple compared with 2016 in some battleground states potentially tipping the election outcome It said voters “could be disenfranchised in key battleground states” and that nullified votes could be “even more pronounced in some urban areas where Democratic votes are concentrated and ballot rejection rates trended higher during this year’s primaries” That’s far from an election “rigged”

{"7412": "WASHINGTON  President   is warning that the country could be headed into its “toughest” weeks yet as the   death toll mounts but at the same time he expressed growing impatience with social distancing guidelines and said he’s eager to get the country reopened and its stalled economy back on track “There will be a lot of death unfortunately” Trump said Saturday in a somber start to his daily briefing on the pandemic There will be death” Joining Trump were Vice President Mike Pence virus task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci the US government’s foremost infection disease expert Each stood far apart from one another on the small stage Trump added a twist on his familiar push for a drug that hasnt been clearly shown to work to stop the virus — he said he may start taking it as a preventative measure after consulting with his doctor even though theres no evidence to show it works for that either The president initially had suggested the country could reopen by Easter         but pulled back seeing projections of a staggering death toll even if restrictive measures remain in place But just days after extending tough national guidelines through the end of April staring down         historic levels of unemployment and economic standstill he was talking about reopening as soon as possible and speaking Saturday with leaders of professional sports leagues about filling arenas again “This country was not designed to be closed” he said The cure cannot be worse than the problem” The number of people infected in the US has exceeded 300000 with the death toll climbing past 8400 more than 3500 of those deaths are in the state of New York For most people the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks For some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia and death Much of the country is under orders to stay home including professional sports leagues that were among the first to clamp down in the pandemic         Trump spoke by phone with top leaders including Roger Goodell of the National Football League and the NBA’s Adam Silver telling them he hoped to get people back in seats as soon as possible “I want fans back in the arenas he said “Whenever we’re ready as soon as we can” The virus has decimated the sports world with the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League suspending their seasons indefinitely and Major League Baseball postponing the start of its season The NCAA basketball tournament was also canceled so were college spring sports A person with knowledge of the call said some of the commissioners weren’t quite as optimistic as Trump because of the concerns raised by public health officials but appreciated the president’s desire to give people hope and fans a reason to be optimistic The person requested anonymity to discuss the private call Californias Gov Gavin Newsom who has three NFL teams in his state was asked if he thought the NFL season would start on time in September “I’m not anticipating that happening in this state he said Hardhit states were seeing cases rise Trump suggested that some states were asking for         more medical supplies than they really needed He said the goal was to stay several days ahead of critical medical needs in each state “The fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests” he said Louisiana officials have said New Orleans is on track to run out of ventilators by next week New York Gov Andrew Cuomo whose state is at the epicenter of the national pandemic with over 113700 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning has pleaded for ventilators for days New York is poised to get more than 1100 ventilators from China and Oregon Health officials did offer some hope that social distance measures were working Fauci said he saw the efforts in action as he went out for a walk in Washington DC and noticed people waiting six feet apart for restaurant take out “As sobering and a difficult as this is what we are doing is making a difference” Fauci said But even as Fauci urged Americans to be patient and let mitigation efforts work Trump said “Mitigation does work But again we’re not going to destroy our country The previously booming economy had been among Trumps biggest talking points as he heads into the 2020 presidential election but the past few weeks         have seen precipitous drops as the US deals with the fallout from the virus that has shuttered businesses gutted airlines and forced people into their homes The president also continued to tout         hydroxychloroquine a drug long used to treat malaria rheumatoid arthritis and lupus after very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent the coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner But the drug has major potential side effects especially for the heart and large studies are underway to see if it is safe and effective for treating COVID19 Trump suggested he may consider whether he should start taking the drug though he also said hed ask his doctor first Some studies are testing whether hydroxychloroquine can help prevent infections in health care workers but none has suggested that others such as the president should take it to prevent infection With Congress away House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pressed for the next aid package to be ready for an April vote in a letter to House Democrats “We must double down on the

{"5412": "As the novel   continues to spread around the globe Secretary of State   on Tuesday accused the governments of   and Iran of censoring information about the outbreaks in their countries and putting the rest of the world at greater risk of its spread The top US diplomats sharp tone towards Beijing was matched by Health and Human Services Secretary   who told Congress on Tuesday that the world is not getting reliable data out of China on issues like mortality rates But President Donald Trump seems to be out of sync with both of his Cabinet members and other top officials praising Chinese President Xi Jinping and his governments handling of the outbreak even as his own administrations response comes under fire from Republican and Democratic members of Congress Censorship It can have deadly consequences Pompeo said Tuesday at the State Department Had China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge The flow of accurate information out of China he added is critical to assisting not just the Chinese people but also citizens across the world He called on all governments to tell the truth about coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations Testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee Azar said the administration is also uncertain if the data provided by China on the novel coronavirus outbreak has been full and transparent But both of those were at odds with Trumps own remarks just two days ago praising Xi for working very very hard and doing a very good job Its a big problem but President Xi hes working very hard to solve the problem and he will solve the problem Trump told reporters at the White House Sunday Trump also showered praise on his own administrations response in the US saying Tuesday in India We have very few people with it  Were really down to probably 10 Most of the people are outside of danger now There have been 57 confirmed cases of the virus in the US with three now released from hospital and no longer thought to be contagious The majority of those  43 of the 57  are Americans repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship or Wuhan China the epicenter of the outbreak Only 14 are individuals that either arrived in the US from China and checked into a hospital or caught the virus in the US from a loved one who had traveled overseas But officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Tuesday that the most recent data suggests another level of virus spread globally with cases identified in more countries now and another level of virus spread The data over the last week has raised our level of concern said Dr Nancy Messonnier director of the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases During his news conference in India Trump also said the US is very close to a vaccine But his acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told Congress Tuesday the US was at least months away from developing one with other advisers testifying one was still a full year away The various answers vexed Republican Sen John Kennedy who told Wolf his numbers arent the same as the CDCs  Dont you think you oughta contact them Trumps administration has requested 25 billion from Congress for emergency supplemental funds to combat COVID19 the viruss formal name That funding would come from a 125 billion emergency cash requested from Congress as well as reprogramming existing money including money Congress allocated to fight Ebola Democrats condemned the move as both insufficient to deal with the crisis and a shortsighted effort to steal funds dedicated to fight Ebola in the words of Sen Chuck Schumer amid the second largest outbreak of that deadly disease still lingering the Democratic Republic of Congo The request is indicative of his towering incompetence and further proof that he and his administration aren’t taking the coronavirus crisis as seriously as they need to be the Senate Democratic Minority Leader added Monday Its not just Democrats however who have challenged the administrations response Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee Sen Richard Shelby RAla told Azar the administrations request is lowballing it possibly and you cant afford to do that  If you lowball something like this youll pay for it later Trumps top diplomat for Europe and his State Department also warned that Russia was spreading disinformation about the novel coronavirus outbreak on Saturday Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Europe Philip Reeker and the agencys Global Engagement Center which combats terrorist propaganda and foreign government disinformation told AFP news agency that thousands of Russianlinked social media accounts are actively spreading alarm about the outbreak in a coordinated effort including accusing the US of creating the virus Pompeo said nothing

{"4224": "CHICAGO  A oncebustling bar and grill tucked below a Michigan Avenue overpass famously inspired a “Saturday Night Live” skit starring John Belushi and Bill Murray But the money the Billy Goat Tavern is losing during the           outbreak is no joke The tavern and millions of other shuttered businesses nationwide have turned to their insurers to help recoup their losses following statemandate closures which combined may exceed 300 billion a month But insurers have widely rejected the claims so the Billy Goat joined a growing line of businesses including barbershops and casinos         suing insurers to force them to pay “These businesses are in the most trying times in their history and are going to their insurance company to get what they paid for” said Chris Esbrook a lawyer for the landmark tavern which opened in 1934 and as legend goes cursed the Chicago Cubs Insurers say policies for natural or manmade disasters don’t cover virus outbreaks that bring economies to a standstill and highstakes battles in courtrooms coast to coast are sure to follow What’s at stake could be the survival of thousands of businesses if insurers don’t pay and the insolvency of bigname insurance companies if they do “Pandemic outbreaks are uninsured because they are uninsurable” David A Sampson president of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association said this month No revenue is flowing into the Billy Goat which previously drew hundreds of tourists a day including some who remember the bestknown line from a series of late 1970s         SNL skits in which restaurant staff rebuffs patrons ordering anything but the house specialties “Cheezborger cheezborger cheezborger No Coke  Pepsi” As many as 30 million small businesses straining to survive with little to no revenue could submit virusrelated claims worth up to 430 billion the insurance association estimated Those unprecedented numbers would be multiple times higher than claims following the Sept 11 attacks The expectation is that insurers will continue to reject the vast majority of claims triggering waves of lawsuits from businesses in nearly every town and city Such a filing frenzy could add to logjams in courts when they reopen fully after the pandemic eases Among dozens of lawsuits filed to date is one by the Choctaw Nation casinos in Oklahoma and another by the Los Angeles law firm of celebrity attorney Mark Geragos “You pay insurance for decades for precisely the unthinkable and when it happens these insurance companies do the unconscionable” by rejecting claims Geragos told The Hollywood Reporter Forcing insurers to pay hundreds of billions of dollars a month could quickly deplete the 800 billion set aside to cover future home auto and other losses according to the insurance association The attorney for the Billy Goat which expanded from its flagship site to include establishments around Chicago says he has little sympathy for insurers “They are in the business of selling people insurance for exactly this kind of situation” Esbrook said “They can’t now cry they’re poor when the very situation they are insuring arises” President Donald Trump recently expressed sympathy for businesses asking insurers to pay up for business interruption coverage “When they finally need it the insurance company says ‘We’re not going to give it’” he said at a coronavirus task force news conference “We can’t let that happen” Similar conflicts are playing out in Europe and Asia though they aren’t likely to see the torrent of lawsuits sure to come in the litigious United States The question on which many cases will hinge is whether the presence of the virus in or near a business can be categorized as direct physical damage something that would otherwise be clearly covered It’s a question courts haven’t definitively answered Proving a microscopic virus was ever even on a business’s premises never mind damaged it could pose a challenge to plaintiff attorneys The Pennsylvania Supreme Court last week may have inadvertently helped business owners make their case when it upheld a state order closing nonessential businesses during the pandemic likening the coronavirus to hurricanes in its ruling “COVID19 pandemic is by all definitions a natural disaster and a catastrophe of massive proportions” the majority opinion said Insurance companies say most policies that cover unanticipated interruptions to a business’s operations specifically exclude pandemics Such exclusions became more common after a SARS virus outbreak in the early 2000s devastated businesses in parts of Asia A message seeking comment from the insurer the Billy Goat is suing Society Insurance wasn’t returned A         note to policyholders on the website of Travelers Indemnity the insurer Geragos is suing reads like a blanket denial of virus shutdown claims because theyre not a result of direct physical loss or damage” It also cites virus exclusions in its policies But such exclusions don’t mean businesses don’t have valid claims the business lawyers contend They point to separate policy provisions requiring that insurers pay losses when civil authorities intervene during emergencies and order businesses to close The Billy Goat Tavern’s legal team says their case may be that much stronger because their insurer did not write in a virus exclusion and then still denied coverage Pressure on insurers isn’t only coming in the form of lawsuits State lawmakers including in Illinois New York and New Jersey have proposed laws that would dictate insurers accept business claims for coronavirus damage in some cases even if policies exclude pandemics Industry advocates say such mandates could drain insurance funds needed to pay claims during upcoming hurricane season and when other natural disaster inevitably strike The laws they argue also would undermine the contract law upon which free markets rely “If elected officials require payment for perils that were excluded never underwritten for and for which no premium was ever collected catastrophic results will occur said Charles Chamness president of the National Association of

{"316": "As the American death toll from the novel coronavirus continues to rise pressure to impose a nationwide stayathome order mounts  has resisted calls to issue a nationwide stayathome directive

director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the Trump administrations coronavirus task force told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the federal government should enact a nationwide stayathome order to curtail the spread of the coronavirus in the United States I dont understand why thats not happening” Fauci said If you look at whats going on in this country I just dont understand why were not doing that We really should be” Whether there should be a federally mandated directive for that or not I guess that’s more of a political question but just scientifically doesn’t everybody have to be on the same page with this stuff” Fauci added Although most states have enacted stayathome orders 9 states have yet to take statewide action Arkansas Gov Asa Hutchinson has repeatedly defended his decision not to issue a stayathome order suggesting that such a measure would cause loss of jobs Were trying to make good judgement based upon good public health data that is scientifically based and makes sense for Arkansas Hutchinson said in a press conference on Thursday He argued that Arkansas residents are already taking precautionary measures by practicing proper social distancing and independently deciding to stay home I understand there is a certain amount of political pressure to do what everyone else is doing Arkansas Department of Health Secretary Dr Nathan Smith added at the press conference What were trying to accomplish here is not to be like every other state or tick off a box What were trying to do is flatten that curve The two

of over 10 people and shut down dining in at restaurants Arkansas schools have been closed until April 17 Iowa Gov Kim Reynolds insists that a statewide stayathome order is unnecessary Reynolds has previously suggested that the measures already implemented by the state are equivalent to an informal stayat homeorder What else are we doing by doing a shelterinplace or stayathome order except for potentially disrupting the supply chain putting additional pressure on the essential workforce and making sure that we are considering how we bring that back up Reynolds said in a recent press conference Democratic leaders in the Hawkeye state have called for Reynolds to issue a statewide shelterinplace order A statewide shelterinplace sends a clearer message about the serious nature of this pandemic The current patchwork of recommendations is confusing raising more questions than answers about what Iowans should be doing to help save lives Iowa Senate and House Democratic leaders Janet Petersen and Todd Prichard wrote in a letter to the governor Reynolds ordered all nonessential businesses closed until April 7 Schools will be closed until April 15 Nebraska Gov Pete Ricketts reiterated on Thursday that he does not believe a statewide stayathome order is necessary yet Were a different state than states like New York that are doing that We are much earlier in the epidemic curve than New York Ricketts said He assured the public that the state is taking appropriate steps and suggested that many of the measures taken by the state are stricter than in some cities and states with stayathome orders The state has also imposed a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people and Nebraska schools will be closed until May 31 Despite lower numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases North Dakota Gov Doug Burgum has repeatedly called for residents to take social distancing seriously in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus The state has closed all athletic facilities theaters bars and restaurants except for takeout delivery and curbside service and has recommended limiting access to nursing homes North Dakota schools are also all closed until further Burgum has asked the states citizens to acknowledge and understand the orders that have already been put in place Oklahoma Gov Kevin Sitt has implemented several precautionary measures including the closure of all nonessential businesses and a saferathome order which was extended to all 77 counties on Wednesday I have agonized over all these decisions but this is the right time to take these steps said Stitt The saferathome order closes all nonessential businesses and directs senior citizens and atrisk residents to self quarantine Such an order is different from a stayathome directive which would require all residents to substantially limit their movements outside the home Further the governor has called a statewide stayathome order “unrealistic” reiterating individual personal responsibility and the need for social distancing Oklahoma schools will also be closed until April 6 Three of South Carolina’s largest cities Charleston Columbia and Mount Pleasant have issued stayathome orders However Gov Henry McMaster has stopped short of enacting a statewide measure On Monday McMaster ordered the closure of all state beaches and subsequently all nonessential businesses We are not ordering people to stay at home but from the very beginning we’ve been telling people to stay home  and a lot of people are staying home McMaster said in a press conference Democratic Representatives have criticized McMaster for not taking further widespread enforcement actions to curtail the spread of the virus in South Carolina I don’t understand why he hasn’t taken that step and told the citizens under the force of law you must stay at home Rep Seth Rose said All South Carolina schools will also be closed until April 30 South Dakota Gov Kristi Noem has repeatedly resisted calls to close the state arguing that South Dakota is not New York City The calls to apply for a onesizefitsall approach to this problem is herd mentality Noem said in a press conference on Wednesday The governor has left the decision surrounding whether to close businesses to local governments saying that this decision was not within her powers However local leaders have disagreed saying that such measures are within her powers during an emergency situation Noem has also stressed the importance of social distancing and personal responsibility That people think if we put everybody in their house and lock them there for two weeks then let em out that the virus will be gone and nobody would get sick and everything would be perfect The state has closed all South Dakota schools until May 1 Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson has called on state officials to implement a statewide stayathome order asserting in a press conference that the coronavirus does not recognize county lines There are currently stayathome orders in five of Utah’s 29 counties However Gov Gary Herbet has maintained his reluctance to issue a statewide order arguing that the state’s Stay Home Stay Safe directive is a more positive route while a stayathome order would elicit fear The Stay Home Stay Safe order encourages residents to stay home as much as possible Navajo Nation which spans parts of Arizona Utah and New Mexico Summit County and Salt Lake City have announced their own stayathome orders and the Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints has also closed its temples and its missionaries around the world were asked to return home and quarantine upon arrival There are also statewide closings of bars and restaurants ski areas gyms theaters and campgrounds Utah schools will be closed until May 1 On Monday Wyoming Gov Mark Gordon said in a press conference that the state has no plans for a stayathome order If were going to issue a shelterinplace or stayathome order it will not have multiple exemptions It will be a true stayathome order Gordon said The governor has asked all residents to stay home as much as possible and urged the need for public cooperation in order for Wyoming to make strides in slowing the spread of the virus The state closed all nonessential businesses last Friday and all Wyoming schools will be closed until April 17 The state has also forbidden gatherings of 10

{"3448": " had already sparred with reporters for more than an hourandahalf Monday evening during his now daily update on his administrations battle   pandemic when he handed the reins over to Vice President Pence waiting patiently nearby “Ladies and gentlemen thank you very much Im going to let our vice president take over” Trump said ducking out of the press briefing leaving Pence to explain more about how the White House is dealing with the crisis It was six weeks ago that the president facing criticism that the governments response was slow and chaotic tapped Pence to assume leadership of the task force At the time the president was still bragging about the low number of documented cases in the US and professing that the virus would “disappear” saying it would be “like a miracle” Every day since the vice president has been at the helm managing the nonstop operations involved in the US effort the nation’s biggest public health crisis in a century While the president has lavished praise on Pence for the job hes doing the vice president never fails to quickly credit the president’s leadership A source familiar with their working relationship says they are in touch multiple times a day “The vice president is nothing but the president’s best staffer” a senior administration official said in describing Pence’s dedication to carrying out the president’s directives Still while the president has largely commandeered the daily briefings before the cameras behind the scenes it is Pence who chairs the daily task force meetings in the Situation Room The president has attended only some of the sessions which run an hourandahalf on average according to a senior official The vice president also is fielding calls from governors and task force members from the early morning hours until late in the night the official said and holding backtoback meetings throughout the day with various stakeholders and affected industries Pence’s singular focus has earned him the president’s particular admiration with Trump declaring on Monday that Pence has done  “an unbelievable job “Hes done much better than well And he gets along with people I think much better than I do” Trump said in a rare moment of public selfreflection Unlike Trump who seems to relish fighting with reporters Pence calmly answers their questions In his trademark reassuring voice he offers empathy and often prayer We see more than 400000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus and sadly weve lost more than 14000 he said somberly at Wednesdays briefing We  we grieve but as the Good Book says we do not grieve like those who have no hope Pence a devout Christian said But even as he earned the president’s praise Pence is careful never to assume credit directly and consistently attributes anything positive to the president’s decisionmaking prowess His actions are “at the president’s direction” and under “the president’s leadership” Beyond Pence’s diplomatic approach in giving credit to the president Pence is himself a former governor and has particularly impressed the president with his deft touch in dealing with governors even those who have criticized the administration’s response “I like people being  Mike can put up with things that  sometimes I say its amazing that he can put up with it But hes done an incredible job” Trump has said Trump has expressed disdain for governors who have been publicly critical of the administration response saying they should “be appreciative” and has expressed particular disdain for Gov Jay Inslee of Washington calling him a “nasty person” “I dont have to call because Im probably better off not because we dont get  hes a failed presidential candidate Hes a nasty person” Trump said of Inslee on March 29 ” I dont like the governor of Washington  So you know who calls  I get Mike Pence to call” Pence knows Inslee from when they served in the House together There’s a good copbad cop dynamic at play according to an administration official who said the differing styles serve to complement one another and acknowledged that the approach is not free of political calculations “At the end of the day these people are still going to run on this in six to eight months” the official said While the president may rant against a particular governor in public comments the official said if a state with a critical governor is “in need of ventilators the federal government is going to get them the ventilators” When the president strikes a combative tone in public the vice president follows up  oftentimes in private  with a reassuring message When the New York health care workers raised alarm bells last week about shortages in critical protective gear needed to protect them on the front lines in treating patients President Trump raised questions about whether the gear was slipping out the back door “That statement was made that they’ve been delivering for years 10 to 20000 masks” Trump said “Okay it’s a New York hospital Very — it’s packed all the time How do you go from 10 to 20 to 300000 10 to 20000 masks to 300000” Vice President Pence followed up several days later with a message directed at the state’s health care workers “Help is on the way” Pence said on the day it was announced that the federal government was sending an additional supply of 200 thousand N95 masks to New York"},
{"1886": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday rejected the advice of Dr Anthony Fauci the nations top infectious disease expert on how cautious governors and local officials need to be when reopening schools amid the   They should open the schools absolutely I think they should And its had very little impact on young people Trump said although new reports have revealed more cases of children stricken with a potentially fatal syndrome possible linked to COVID19 Its the governors choice but their state is not open if the schools are not open the president told reporters while hosting the governors of Colorado and North Dakota at the White House continuing his drive for states to reopen Asked about Faucis concerns with reopening schools in the fall where there are localized outbreaks that might get out of control Trump said Fauci wants to play all sides of the equation He made his comments after Fox News hosts attacked Fauci Tuesday evening Earlier Wednesday Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded the Trump White House release highly anticipated guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how states should safely reopen which were   shelved as President   ramped up his push for the country to get back to work The point is that America needs  and must have  the candid guidance of our best scientists unfiltered unedited uncensored by President Trump for his political minions Schumer said on the Senate floor The CDC report on reopening the country is an important piece of that guidance Schumer said calling on his colleagues to pass by unanimous consent a resolution requesting immediate release of the report reportedly titled Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework The White House on Friday claimed the guidelines delayed for weeks are still in the editing process While CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield testified Tuesday that the new guidance would go online soon Sen Chris Murphy DConn said the delay isnt very helpful as his and other states reopen many without waiting for a 14day downward trend in cases Fauci and other health experts have warned was crucial to doing so safely As schools around the country mull a return in the fall amid the coronavirus pandemic President Donald Trump said he absolutely thinks they should all reopen by the third quarter adding that he wont consider the country back until physical schooling is a part of it They should open the schools absolutely I think they should And its had very little impact on young people Trump said although new reports have revealed more young children being hospitalized with respiratory problems Its the governors choice but their state is not open if the schools are not open Trump said sitting beside the governors of Colorado and North Dakota in the White House Asked about Faucis concerns with reopening the country too soon Trump said Fauci wants to play all sides of the equation Pressed to clarify what he meant by all sides Trump said he was speaking on schools specifically and didnt think Faucis response to the topic on Tuesday was an acceptable answer I was surprised by his answer actually because you know its just to me its not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools Trump said This is a disease that attacks age and it attacks health Trump continued adding that seniors may want to wait a few weeks before returning to school but repeating the claim that the virus has little impact on young people Fauci in congressional testimony Tuesday did not advise that schools should stay closed but said a regions ability to handle an outbreak should play a part in the decision to reopen schools It would depend on the dynamics of the outbreak in the region where the school is Fauci said Tuesday He also said it shouldnt be assumed that children are immune to contracting COVID19 Weve got to be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects Fauci said Earlier Wednesday President Trump said in a sitdown interview with Fox Businesss Maria Bartiromo that he totally disagrees with Dr Anthony Fauci when it comes to opening schools In a   released Wednesday afternoon Trump called Fauci a very good person but said that young people are very little affected by this and we have to get the schools open Trump also said we cant keep going on like this because youre having bedlam already on the streets The interview comes one day after Fox News hosts including Tucker Carlson Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham launched an assault of Fauci on their programs Tuesday night noting he isnt an elected official following the doctors congressional testimony and constructive criticisms of the countrys response to the novel virus He is not and no one is the one person who should be in charge when it comes to making longterm recommendations This guy Fauci may be even more offbase than your average epidemiologist Carlson said Tuesday at one point referring to Fauci as the chief buffoon The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis held its first of several hearings with a bipartisan group of public health experts on plans to safely reopen the country during the coronavirus pandemic Towards the top Rep Maxine Waters DCalif thanked the committee members for sending their condolences after her sister recently died from COVID19 While Im sitting here my sisters viewing is going on today in St Louis Waters said with a somber tone Many families have been touched and so Im hopeful that we can all get together Democrats and Republicans and deal with this pandemic Soon after Rep Jim Jordan ROhio a strong Trump ally used his three minutes to question the purpose of the committee altogether claiming it is partisan and designed to go after Trump Weve got eight different entities currently looking at oversight of the CARES Act and the coronavirus crisis but we needed this ninth and I would argue this ninth is political Its a committee designed to go after the president Jordan said The very first witness two minutes ago said it was inadequate testing that initiated the shutdown I thought the shutdown was initiated to bend the curve so our health care system wasnt overwhelmed But weve already got a political statement from the very first witness Jordan continued The first witness to speak Dr Ashish Jha director of the Harvard Global Health Institute defended his opening statement Let me start off just by quickly responding to Congressman Jordans statement that my opening remarks were partisan They were not Jha said Every expert on the left right and center agrees that we had to shut our economy down because the outbreak got too big because we didnt have a testing infrastructure that allowed us to and put our arms around the outbreak And so testing was the fundamental failure that forced our country to shut down he explained Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr Scott Gottlieb also emphasized a phased reopening with testing contact tracing and isolation  especially in vulnerable communities  and said new technologies can accelerate the process The reality is that we may need to define a new normal Gottlieb said Theres not going to be a defined end to this until we get better technology and drugs and vaccines but we need to find ways to try to return to work to return to the things that we enjoy more safely and with greater vigilance than we did before  and theres a way to do that All five panelists were in agreement that testing is essential to a safe reopening The House hearing comes one day after Sen Mitt Romney RUtah on Tuesday criticized the federal governments response to testing calling it nothing to celebrate whatsoever after President Trump held a news conference touting his administrations testing capability Rick Bright the ousted director of the federal agency tasked with developing a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is

{"118": "In the middle of a crisis of unrivaled magnitude President Trump is finding himself on new terrain in more ways than one after a new   revealed a small bump of support in the presidents approval among Democrats  up 13 points While that 13point rise was only to a meager 17 it does perhaps represent a significant movement of some Democrats behind the president with those Americans looking beyond political polarization to score his performance as the coronavirus grips the country Trumps overall approval 4846 is the first time since taking office that his approval is higher than his disapproval according to the new poll Another 51 approve of his handling of the outbreak despite 58 say he acted too slowly at the onset In followup interviews with several selfidentified Democrats who may span the ideological spectrum but all approved of the presidents management of the pandemic in the most recent ABC NewsWashington Post poll they offered a perspective largely driven more by anxiety over the   and economic impacts of the outbreak rather than politics about why Trump deserves high marks I like the idea that the federal government stepped in and is coming up with strategiesto try and help us out so that we have some form of hope people are in turmoil psychologically Alvonica Jackson a resident of Washington DC said It’s a big deal It’s bigger than money the money is not going to change the psychological scars that a lot of us are suffering Although she supports Trump’s overall response she told ABC News she wishes it came sooner and that he took the spread of the disease more seriously from its onset I think that he should have just responded rather than just downplayed it Jackson said If our government or   would have just acted immediately then it wouldn’t have a chance to spread That sentiment is echoed by another respondent who approved of the president but also yearned for a swifter response from the federal government If he would have acted a little sooner with closing our borders down they should have had a lockdown travel ban I think Roger Ferguson in Ohio told ABC News But as his household battles against steepening medical costs Ferguson is looking to a check from the newlypassed unprecedented 22 trillion stimulus package which Trump signed last week for help 1200 would help out tremendously he said We’ve spent money that weve saved because my mom has got cancer right now On top of her medication we’ve had to go and spend tons of extra money on preventative things to keep her safe Some of the respondents despite their party affiliation suggested that amid the crisis they are looking for any action as a signal of leadership I dont have knowledge to say how I would do it a respondent from Pennsylvania who asked to remain anonymous told ABC News in an interview While she conceded that Trump has been at odds with those in the medical field she still currently approves of his performance because I dont know what else he could do I couldnt do a better job but more can be done I dont know who could do better because theyre not in this position But for now things could be improving One Democrat Yvette Brown from Cook County Illinois said she approved of Trump that day when the poll was taken because he was actively defending Americans against the coronavirus  a still evolving threat at the time to most But on Saturday Brown had a decidedly different view of Trumps handling of the crisis Not today she said On that day it was new she said of her initial response And anythingdoing something was approval because there was no room for just being stagnant and he wasnt He was doing something When asked why she has since changed her mind she explained that she now has more knowledge and information and a bare minimum response isnt okay At that point we didnt know a lot she said Now we know more And so what you do makes a difference It was knowledge as opposed to ignorance and hes making from what I hear decisions that may be more harmful than good Among those decisions that she viewed as harmful Brown pointed to Trumps comments about having the country opened up by Easter which falls on April 12 But some of the Democrats who positively scored the president in the poll have been longtime supporters of his White House One poll respondent who has been registered with the Democratic Party for a long time but who voted for Trump in 2016 since he said he was never voting for Hillary Clinton applauds Trump’s response because he feels allowing governors to take the lead in handling the outbreak was the right move Hes putting the governors in charge Joseph Marshall Jr from Ohio said I agree with that In one press briefing in midMarch Trump labeled himself in a sense a wartime president Marshall told ABC News he loved that rhetoric Were in a war Look at how many people are dying Look at how many businesses are going out because of his coronavirus Its really scary he said But despite the relatively better scores among Democrats Trump trails historically among those leaders before him who in the middle of crisis saw approval ratings soar as the country rallied behind the commanderinchief In the few days after the 911 attacks President George W Bush’s approval rating among Democrats skyrocketed to 78 according to Gallup About 10 days later it peaked at 84 Another hurdle for the president is that he is seeing a similar level of disapproval among those within his own party 12 in the ABC NewsWashington Post poll I think he should have alerted the public earlier But if he was going to alert the public earlier then the businesses were going to hurt He needed to do well at balancing the two Cary Chui a Republican from California who responded to the poll said in a followup interview We have so many ways to alarm the public besides only saying It’s fine or saying It’s a little flu he should have done something differently he said Along with Chui Jennings Hughes an independent with Republican leanings who also responded to the poll said he is most concerned about the economic impact suggesting that the government’s response is not comprehensive enough to counter the devastating effects I just think that not enough weight was given to the economic consequences Hughes said Now if your business is going out of business how is 1200 gonna fix that situation as opposed to letting customers come to your business Hughes who is in the real estate business told ABC News in a followup interview that she believes allowing states to shutter the majority of businesses all at once was not the best response Im just disappointed collectively in our leaderships willingness to shut everything down and the consequences of that as

{"670": "WASHINGTON  Public   officials were already warning Americans about the need to prepare for the coronavirus threat in early February when President   called it         “deadly stuff” in a private conversation that has only now has come to light At the time the virus was mostly a problem in China with just 11 cases confirmed in the United States There was uncertainty about how the US ultimately would be affected and top US officials would deliver some mixed messages along the way But their overall thrust was to take the thing seriously “We’re preparing as if this is a pandemic Dr Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters on Feb 5 “This is just good commonsense public   Trump however had a louder megaphone than his health experts and in         public he was playing down the threat Three days after delivering his “deadly” assessment in a private call with journalist Bob Woodward he told a New Hampshire rally on Feb 10 “It’s going to be fine Trumps acknowledgment in Woodwards new book “Rage” that he was         minimizing the severity of the virus in public to avoid causing panic has triggered waves of criticism that he wasnt leveling with the American people The White House has tried to answer that criticism by pointing to selected comments from US health experts to suggest they were on the same page with Trump all along White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany highlighted comments from Dr Anthony Fauci the nation’s top infectious disease expert to try to make the case that Trump didn’t lie to the public She cited a Feb 17 interview in which Fauci focused his concern on the seasonal flu then playing out But a day later Fauci had spoken of alarming potential implications from the new virus saying “Not only do we not have an appreciation of the magnitude even more disturbing is that we don’t have an appreciation of where the magnitude is going” Mixed safety messages added to confusion There was considerable discussion about maskwearing in the early days of the pandemic with leading experts advising the public against it saying to leave the masks for health care workers “Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS” US Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted on Feb 29 Officials later recommended that people wear face coverings in public and around people who don’t live in their household based on a review of the latest evidence People could find different takeaways within Faucis pronouncements He told the USA Today editorial board on Feb 17 that the CDC would be testing people for the coronavirus in five major cities when they showed up at clinics with flulike symptoms If that testing showed the virus had slipped into the country in places federal officials didnt know about “we’ve got a problem” Fauci said Still the headline put the spotlight on his remark that the danger posed by the virus was slight It read “Top disease official Risk of coronavirus in USA is ‘minuscule’” Larry Gostin a professor at Georgetown University who has advised Republican and Democratic administrations on public health issues said there should be no confusing honest mistakes and expressions of uncertainty from public health officials with Trump’s effort to minimize the threat of COVID19 “It is irrefutable that he has played down the epidemic and sidelined trusted scientists and in some cases muzzled them” Gostin said He added I categorically deny the idea that there wasn’t a strong consensus of public health experts at the time saying this was a very serious problem” Trump himself told Woodward on March 19 that he had deliberately minimized the danger “I wanted to always play it down” the president said “I still like playing it down because I don’t want to create a panic” Critics have long noted how Trumps public comments failed to sync up with those of public health officials contributing to confusion among Americans As Trump left for India on Feb 23 he told reporters that the virus was “very much under control and that the small number of infected people in the US were “very well confined But two days later the CDCs Messonnier told reporters “It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but more really a question of when it will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness Stocks plunged following her remarks and soon after Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence to lead the White House coronavirus task force At the news conference announcing Pence’s selection Trump was asked if he agreed with the inevitability of COVID19 in the United States “Well I don’t think it’s inevitable It probably will It possibly will It could be at a very small level or it could be at a larger level Whatever happens we’re totally prepared” Trump said Sandra Crouse Quinn a University of Maryland professor who researches crisis communications during public health emergencies said it’s critical not to overreassure people in a pandemic “You help the public anticipate what’s coming” she said Dr Howard Koh of Harvard’s school of public health said unflinchingly communicating what’s known as soon as possible helps build trust that will be necessary as the pandemic progresses Koh said the role of the White House in a pandemic is to galvanize national attention for public health officials and then step out of the way But that hasn’t been the case under Trump said Koh who was at the Department of Health and Human Services under President Barack Obama As the fallout played out last week Trump got some backup from Fauci who told Fox News that he didnt get the sense that Trump had distorted anything But in an interview with MSNBC Fauci noted the discrepancies between his own comments and the presidents “As you know there were times when I was out there telling the American public how difficult this is how we’re having a really serious problem you know and the president was saying it’s something that’s going to disappear which obviously is not the case” he said ———— Associated Press writer Candice Choi in New York contributed to this report"},

Trump tapped Giroir assistant secretary of Health and Human Services to become testing ‘czar’ earlier this week amid growing complaints about the slow US response Broadscale testing is a critical part of tracking and containing pandemics But the US effort has been hobbled by a series of missteps including flaws with the testing kits first distributed by the federal government and bureaucratic hurdles that held up testing by private laboratories Although federal agencies are responsible for tracking pandemics Trump suggested in a Tweet that the onus is now on those outside Washington “The individual Governors of States and local officials must step up their efforts on drive up testing and testing sights” in conjunction with the CDC Trump tweeted Sunday night Because of the lack of nationwide testing public health experts have warned that the coronavirus is likely spreading undetected in parts of the US A surge in COVID19 cases could quickly overwhelm intensive care units at US hospitals For most people the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough For some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 156000 people and left more than 5800 dead The death toll in the United States is more than 50 while infections neared 3000 across 49 states and the District of Columbia The vast majority of people recover According to the World Health Organization people with mild illness recover in about two weeks while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover Countries in Europe and Asia have been using drivethru testing sites to perform mass screening for weeks South Korea for example reports testing about 15000 people per day Pence told reporters Sunday that 10 US states now have drivethru testing sites including New York Colorado Texas and Delaware Pence said the administration

would be available this week But it wasnt clear if it would immediately have the features previously highlighted by Trump and his administration Verily a health care subsidiary of Google said earlier Sunday that its COVID19 screening tool would launch online Monday in the San Francisco Bay area allowing users to take an electronic survey to determine whether they should be screened for the virus The company described the effort as in its “early stages” Parent company Google said in an online post Sunday that it would launch a website dedicated to COVID19 “education prevention and local

federal state and local government labs have tested fewer than 20000 US patients according to federal figures Currently those labs are using a manual process to develop patient samples in small batches of less than 100 per day Those figures don’t reflect testing by private labs which are beginning to ramp up their capacity Since Friday two companies — Roche and Thermo Fisher— received emergency regulatory authorization for “highvolume” automated tests for the virus The American Clinical Laboratory Association which represents private labs estimated the industry will be able to process 280000 tests per week by April The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells people to seek testing if they have certain symptoms of the flulike illness caused by the coronavirus – fever cough and trouble breathing – and if they have traveled recently to a coronavirus outbreak area or have been in close contact with someone who’s been infected Public health officials have cautioned that unnecessary testing for coronavirus could hamper the health workforces response “Increased testing of people with mild or no symptoms brings increased risk of infection while you wait to get tested stresses health care that may be needed for people who are sicker and is no guarantee that you won’t test positive tomorrow” said Dr Tom Frieden former director of the CDC in an emailed

as at the market spiked more than 300 points then dove into negative territory and then inched back into positive territory over the course of his 77minute press conference “I think the economy is going to be fantastic” The president headed to the same place again on Friday while the markets were open for an even longer news conference where he vacillated between expressing optimism and lashing out about “nasty” journalists negativity Amid more difficult news—the number of confirmed infections around the globe surpassed 250000 cases—the Dow Jones industrial average closed down more than 45 percent on Friday At the end of the markets heaviest losses in more than 30 years the market closed at 1917398 below where it stood on the day before Trump was inaugurated and erased the socalled “Trump bump” that hes pointed to throughout his presidency as evidence of his prowess as the economic steward Nevertheless in the midst of one of the most volatile moments ever for the US economy Trump has wagered that his voice is the daily balm needed to soothe investor concerns Over the course of the last eight daysall on which he held extended news conferences about the coronavirus response in the midst of trading  his comments haven’t stopped the bleeding The Dow has lost more than 17 since March 13 and has plummeted more than 34 since the market hit an alltime high Feb 19 The president’s decision to offer daily affirmations to the   of the stock market and the economy writ large is not surprising But no president has tied his fortunes to Wall Street more closely than Trump who until the market crash bragged that the rising stock market was evidence of his success leading the economy “Maybe he should take it offline”’ said Mark Zandi chief economist for Moody Analytics “But this president He’s not going to do that” Jimmy Carter George HW Bush and George W Bush avoided talking about the stock market with substance let alone trying to impact the market in the midst of trading Bill Clinton took to heart his economic adviser Robert Rubin’s advice that markets go up and markets go down Barack Obama was ridiculed as the stockpickerinchief less than two months into office when he suggested in the midst of a market slide that it was a good time to buy undervalued stocks For much of his next six years in office the 44th president was often measured when even talking about the improved health of the economy his first term started in throes of the Great Recession but he left office with 75 straight months of job growth By the latter part of his presidency Obama began claiming credit for the bull market on occasion “The stock market is booming” Obama declared in a speech in a July 2014 speech in Kansas City Those close to Trump said he was fully aware that the coronavirus posed an enormous threat to the very same oncebooming markets he touted as the calling card of his presidency even as he was publicly downplaying concerns about the virus In the weeks that the pandemic ballooned into a public health emergency Trump had become increasingly frustrated as he privately expressed concerns to his advisers about the effect the virus could have on the markets and ultimately his reelection effort according to White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing Trump throughout his presidency has viewed the markets performance as his “daily report card of his job performance Zandi said With the pandemic thrusting the economy toward a recession Zandi said that Trump now appears to be turning to the market for an “hourly report card” to gauge the effectiveness of his response “In the past sometimes it worked and sometimes it doesn’t” Zandi said of the president’s yearslong cheerleading of the market “Recently it hasn’t He’s in fact as of late done less to instill confidence and more to upset investors They don’t view his actions as very productive in terms of this crisis It’s worked against him” Throughout his presidency Trump has used offthecuff diatribes to try to shame major publiclytraded companies whose business dealings are at odds with his political interests tapped out timely friendly tweets about China’s Xi Jinping to calm market concerns about trade wars and repeatedly berated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about the central bank’s policies during market dips Trump has repeatedly made clear that the battered market is top of his mind as trillions of dollars in wealth and nearly all the gains for the Dow Jones Industrial tallied since his inauguration have been erased He has sought to will a comeback with his daily updates about his administration’s efforts to contain the virus in the midst of trading day Zandi said It mostly hasnt worked Trump held a Rose Garden press conference on March 13 just before the New York Stock Exchange closed for the weekend to declare a national emergency to announce greater availability of virus testing kits were in the pipeline and to declare he was ordering the purchase of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Later that weekend he boasted during another news conference that the market responded to his performance with its biggest singleday gain ever Left unsaid by the president was the fact that market had its singleworst day since the 1987 Black Monday the day before the record gain “I think we should do one of them every day perhaps How about five times a day” Trump remarked “We’ll do one five times a day But that was something to watch and — I had no idea” The huge Friday gains that Trump bragged came from his marketwhispering were followed by a wipeout Monday that saw a historic nearly 3000point slide for the Dow Investors dumped stocks after the Feds surprise move on Sunday evening to cut interest rates to near zero a move that appeared to only exacerbate investor worries about a global recession The Fed rate cut came the day after Trump again publicly berated Powell over lending rates Jason Furman a Harvard University economist who served as Obama’s chief economic adviser said Trump should provide important coronavirus updates whenever he and his team sees fit But Furman also advised that Trump should “let the stock market take care of itself” Diane Swonk chief economist at Grant Thornton said the “genie is out of the bottle” with Trump’s consistent attempts to shape the market through Twitter and the media And with the global nature of the marketplace when Trump makes his comments remains less important than the substance of his remarks she said “This is where facts matter information matters and very focused communication matters” Swonk said “His experts should be all the focus His job should be to be the steward right now Often the alpha dog isn’t the first one in the pack” —— Associated

{"401": "President   had direct praise for Florida Gov Ron DeSantis at a press conference Tuesday Great governor Knows exactly what he’s doing Trump hailed Floridas response to the novel   outbreak as he answered a question about the Republicans resistance to issuing statewide stayathome restrictions for Floridians Now less than 24 hours after the administration revealed sobering data with death toll projections in the US between 100000 to 240000 with social distancing and proper mitigation measures in place DeSantis reversed course and told citizens in his state Wednesday afternoon to stay home for the next 30 days As elsewhere in the country confirmed cases of coronavirus have continued to rise in Florida up to nearly 7000 as of Wednesday the fifthhighest total of any state   by Johns Hopkins University DeSantis has developed a close relationship with the president and the two speak frequently On Monday Trump opened   by congratulating DeSantis and his wife Casey on their new baby joking that he had a good excuse not to be on the phone call according to an audio recording of the call obtained by ABC News DeSantis said he spoke with the president and other White House officials about Wednesday’s decision to order Floridians to stay at home prior to the announcement I did consult with folks in the White House I did speak with the president about it DeSantis said Wednesday He agreed with the approach of focusing on the hot spots but at the same time you know he understood that this is another 30day situation and you gotta just do what makes the most sense From the beginning of the coronavirus spread in the US DeSantis faced scrutiny over what some critics have described as a lackadaisical approach to restricting gatherings and ordering the closing of various businesses as some other states were quicker to do so Florida Democrat Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz said last week that DeSantiss decisions had shown a lack of leadership in the state We have a governor who has been really irresponsible and has had an absence of leadership she said Im trying to think of the nicest way I can put it Last month when photographs of crowded beaches filled with spring breakers emerged the governor left the decision to close beaches to local municipalities DeSantis did end up ordering beach gatherings be limited to 10 people but he stopped short of ordering them closed Democratic members of Florida’s congressional delegation also raised their concerns in a letter to DeSantis Tuesday telling him they appreciated a recent announcement issuing a safer at home order for the southern portion of the state but said that wasn’t enough given the rapid increase in positive cases This pandemic has not respected global borders so it certainly will not respect county borders the 13 Democratic members wrote We cannot wait and we cannot leave this decision to county and municipal governments We urge you to immediately issue a statewide stayathome order to save lives A total of 45 states have now issued or announced statewide closures of nonessential businesses Georgia Gov Brian Kemp and Mississippi Gov Tate Reeves also issued a stayathome orders for their states Wednesday Prior to the reversal when specifically asked about DeSantis not issuing a stayathome order the US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on NBC that his advice to America would be that these guidelines are a national stay at home order as he held up the White House recommendations to slow the spread of the virus While Florida has lagged behind other states in their response the state has received all of their requested supplies from the federal government within days of the request Florida is also among only few states that are the first to receive newly developed rapid tests that are expected to significantly reduce test turnaround time DeSantis said during a press briefing that the state has deployed about 1700 rapid tests to Memorial Healthcare System and another 500 to northern Florida When the president was asked why Florida has received 100 percent of its request for supplies compared to other states that are having difficulty and have pleaded for help he said it’s because Florida is very aggressive Well Florida they are very aggressive in trying to get things and they are doing a very good job but I think I can say all of the governors are very committed Trump said Sunday We’re very committed We’re working together We’re getting things out at a level that nobody has ever seen before Memorial Healthcare System said it has ample protective equipment for its frontline workforce thanks to its significant inventory prior to the outbreak and to community donations On Monday Floridas Department of Emergency Management said officials there have ordered 250000 coveralls 500000 gowns 500000 gloves 150000 full kits of protection and 2 million of the allimportant N95 masks But some Florida nurses and their unions say healthcare workers in the state are still pushed into dangerous frontlines without the proper protection Rosanne OMalley an emergency room nurse at the Medical Center of Trinity in the city of Trinity told ABC News that her hospital provides its staff with just one procedural mask throughout their shift and N95 masks Other protective gear like gowns gloves and goggles are reserved only for those entering COVID19 units she said O’Malley who is part of the team that screens incoming patients for fever and coughs before they enter the emergency room said her team should have more protection than just disposable surgical masks that they wear throughout their 12hour shift and her hospital should have the money and resources to provide that Gov DeSantis says hes gotten the equipment but the trickle down just hasnt happened yet O’Malley said Maybe just we dont see that in the emergency room but a lot of nurses on the floor are saying the same thing We have minimal protection but not maximum protection Kim Brooks a registered nurse with a steppeddown intensive care unit at Blake Medical Center in Bradenton said she was suspended from work for wearing an N95 mask she brought herself Brooks said she wasn’t taking care of COVID19 patients but she felt that she needed to protect herself and her family now knowing who might have the virus It is very scary We do feel like there is a shortage Just on the regular floor or even on the steppeddown ICU floor without COVID patients we dont have the opportunity to have the masks unless we supply them ourselves Brooks said Were open to contracting the virus Im concerned for their physical health care workers across the country The Medical Center of Trinity and Blake Medical Center did not immediately response to ABC News request for comment Dr Mark Supino an attending physician in the Emergency Department at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami said that while he feels the hospital has adequate personal protection equipment supplies they  have been rationing so that they do not run out Supino told ABC News he has been wearing the same N95 mask for a week Supino has also begun wearing a regular surgical mask that can be more easily discarded over his N95 respirator which he described as a smart way to protect a vital supply This is kind of what we have always been preparing for Supino said But I dont think any of us could have ever predicted something on this scale"}
