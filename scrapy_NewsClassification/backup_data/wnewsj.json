{"758": "WASHINGTON AP — As requests for ventilators from the national stockpile reached a crescendo in late March President Donald Trump made what seemed like a bold claim His administration would have 100000 within 100 days At the time the Department of Health and Human Services had not ordered any new ventilators since the start of the COVID19 pandemic in January But records show that over the following three weeks the agency scrambled to turn Trump’s pledge into a reality spending nearly 3 billion to spur US manufacturers to crank out the breathing machines at an unprecedented pace An analysis of federal contracting data by The Associated Press shows the agency is now on track to exceed 100000 new ventilators by around July 13 about a week later than the 100day deadline Trump first gave on March 27 By the end of 2020 the administration is expected to take delivery of nearly 200000 new ventilators based on the AP’s review of current federal purchasing contracts That would more than double the estimated 160000 ventilators hospitals across the US had before the pandemic “We became the king of ventilators thousands and thousands of ventilators” Trump boasted in an April 29 speech But over the past month demand for ventilators has decreased even as the US death toll from the novel coronavirus has surged past 75000 After observing unusually high death rates for coronavirus victims who were put on ventilators many doctors are using them only as a last resort That’s raising the unexpected prospect that the United States could soon be awash in surplus ventilators so much so the White House is now planning to ship thousands overseas to help boost the virus response of other nations In a speech to Republican members of Congress on Friday the president credited his soninlaw White House senior adviser Jared Kushner with heading up the effort to purchase the ventilators “We built and we built and we built” Trump said “Now we have nine factories that are throwing out ventilators at numbers that nobody can believe It was really — there’s not been anything like that since the Second World War where we did the same thing with other types of product” Daniel Adelman a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who teaches health care analytics said the US government is now buying more than twice the number of ventilators it needs even under a worstcase scenario forecasting the spread of COVID19 But Adelman said mathematical models cannot predict with certainty how many ventilators will be needed if there is a resurgence of the coronavirus later in the year or if there is another pandemic in the future “It seems incongruent with the forecasts that you’re seeing” Adelman said of the government purchases “I’d probably rather they order too many rather than ordering too few”  In patients with severe cases of COVID19 the virus attacks the lungs causing fluid to collect in tiny air sacs called alveoli That makes it difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood which can be deadly To treat these low oxygen levels doctors have historically relied on ventilators The Strategic National Stockpile the federal government’s emergency reserve of medical supplies had about 16660 ventilators ready to deploy at the start of March with an additional 2400 out for maintenance By the middle of the month health officials and governors in states with the worst virus outbreaks began expressing concerns that the supply of breathing machines could run out potentially leaving thousands of critically ill patients gasping for air Among those calling for additional ventilators was Gov Andrew Cuomo DNY who predicted on March 24 that all of the ventilators in his state would be in use and patients in need would be left without proper treatment Cuomo said projections showed New York would need at least 30000 additional ventilators to get through the midApril peak of the outbreak At that point FEMA had sent New York 400 Trump expressed skepticism at Cuomo’s figures even as his administration rushed to send New York 4000 additional ventilators — about onequarter of the nation’s entire emergency stockpile Still Cuomo pleaded for more “You pick the 26000 people who are going to die” Cuomo said at a news conference It wasn’t just New York however Similarly dire projections of a ventilator shortfall were also then circulating within the White House “The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when after a long day of meetings my team told me that we were going to be needing 130000 ventilators that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators” Trump recounted in an April 14 briefing “I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have” By late March a bipartisan chorus of state governors and members of Congress were calling on the president to exercise his emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to force US companies to produce ventilators Trump had resisted invoking the Korean Warera law which grants the president sole authority to direct US industrial production of critical supplies in times of national emergency saying the private sector was stepping up production of ventilators and other medical supplies on its own But on March 27 Trump changed course announcing that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce ventilators which meant companies would have to give priority to federal orders over other customers “In the next 100 days — well first of all we’ve already delivered thousands of them — but within the next 100 days we will either make or get in some form over 100000 additional units” Trump said  By the start of April FEMA officials confirmed to the House Oversight and Reform Committee that demand for ventilators would soon outpace the available supply To ration what was left FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor directed that the remaining ventilators in the national stockpile be designated as a “strategic national asset” — to be provided to states only on a casebycase basis where hospitals could demonstrate an “exigent need” to sustain life within 72 hours Federal purchasing records show that three months into the pandemic HHS which includes the Strategic National Stockpile had not yet placed any orders for new ventilators in 2020 That changed within three days of Trump’s March 27 edict with HSS signing a 350 million deal with Zoll Medical Corp Records show a flurry of about a dozen big orders with other ventilator makers over the next two weeks most of them nobid contracts exempted from the typical federal purchasing rules due to the national emergency In a typical year US companies produce about 29000 ventilators according to data cited by the White House Though several domestic manufacturers had already announced they were adding extra shifts and hiring additional workers to ramp up production AP’s analysis of HHS contracts show that even with the emergency nobid orders the traditional medical device makers would deliver about 73990 new ventilators by July 6 — the 100day mark since Trump’s March 27 pledge It was clear additional industrial capacity would be needed to get 100000 units by the president’s deadline General Motors which had shut down auto production had already entered into a partnership on March 20 with Ventec Life Systems a small ventilator company to simplify an offtheshelf design for rapid production at GM’s Kokomo Indiana plant Though GM had announced it was “working night and day” to launch production Trump accused CEO Mary Barra via Twitter of dragging her feet and revived his longrunning feud with the company over its 2019 closure of an Ohio factory that Trump had pledged to save “As usual with ‘this’ General Motors things just never seem to work out” Trump tweeted on March 27 “General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio or some other plant and START MAKING VENTILATORS NOW” GM had sold the Lordstown factory in 2019 The president also took aim at Ford Motor Co tweeting that the rival automaker should also “GET GOING ON VENTILATORS FAST” On April 8 HHS announced it had reached a 4894 million deal with GM to produce 30000 ventilators by the end of August with the first 6132 delivered by June 1 The following week HHS announced a 336 million contract with Ford and General Electric which teamed up to make 50000 of GE Healthcare’s ventilators by July 13 Assuming all the companies meet their deadlines AP’s analysis shows the national stockpile should surpass 100000 new ventilators by midJuly  HHS declined to release to AP its contracts with ventilator producers without a Freedom of Information Act request a legal process that can often take months or even years But AP’s analysis of the limited contract data available online and figures taken from HHS media releases shows the agency will spend more than 29 billion for 198890 ventilators by the end of 2020 an average perunit cost of 14618 Whether that’s a good deal for US taxpayers is difficult to determine because medical device makers generally don’t publish their prices HHS is buying at least 13 different models of ventilators from 10 different companies all with different capabilities features and accessories When AP sought details from HHS about the perunit cost of four models from manufacturer Hamilton Medical the agency’s press office provided figures that did not add up to the totals announced in earlier media releases An HHS spokesperson said the previously provided figures were wrong and would be corrected on the agency’s website AP found several instances where the US government had purchased the same models of ventilators before the pandemic For example contracting data does show that in December the Department of Defense bought a single portable ventilator from Zoll Medical for 12260 Under its current contract with Zoll HHS is purchasing 18900 of the same model for slightly more than 350 million That works out to about 18500 each which would be a more than 50 percent increase from what the Pentagon paid less than five months ago A HHS spokeswoman said Friday the government was paying about 12100 for each ventilator and that the additional money was for hoses face masks and other related supplies needed to treat COVID19 patients The ventilators also came with a wheeled plastic case with power port which cost an additional 722 each according to HHS The Defense Department did not respond to questions Friday about whether its 2019 ventilator deliveries also included accessories Zoll’s top executive said his company’s pricing had remained consistent “Zoll is supplying the US government with its requested products at our usual and customary government pricing absorbing the additional costs associated with Zoll’s rapid increase in production capacity” Zoll CEO Jonathan Rennert said Friday “We are focused on fulfilling the government’s order on time and meeting this urgent public need” Erik Gordon a business professor at the University of Michigan who studies the medical device industry said ventilator companies are probably incurring increased costs as they ramp up production to meet high demand Manufacturers haven’t had time to bulk buy additional parts and probably had to add workers to make more of the machines he said US ventilator makers have raised production from a rate of about 700 per week in February to about 5000 per week by early April according to the Advanced Medical Technology Association an industry trade group “If you don’t have time to change your manufacturing processes to get those economies of scale you get there by brute force extra labor” said Gordon who teaches a course in monetizing medical device ideas “Your costs actually go up not down” With the federal government buying most of the new ventilators being made in the US state governments and hospital systems urgently seeking the machines have often been forced to go through middlemen or foreign suppliers Cuomo has compared the freeforall bidding to going on eBay and said during a March 31 briefing that New York had ordered 17000 ventilators from China for 25000 each “We are paying 25000 per ventilator and we are broke” Cuomo said “The last thing I want to do is buy a single ventilator I don’t need” More than a month later only 2500 of the Chinese machines have been delivered according to Cuomo’s office In a separate case New York officials are trying to recover another 691 million paid to a Silicon Valley electrical engineer who promised 1450 ventilators that never materialized  With nearly 200000 new ventilators set for delivery to the federal stockpile by the end of the year Trump is declaring victory But it is now unclear whether the stockpile of new ventilators will be needed In the little more than a month since Trump announced the buying spree a series of medical studies has spurred questions about whether ventilators are effective at saving the lives of critically ill COVID19 patients A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 30 found that only 1 of 7 patients older than 70 who were put on a ventilator survived For patients younger than 70 just 36 lived In New York City state officials say 80 or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines died The studies have caused doctors to reevaluate the use of ventilators in favor of less intensive forms of respiratory support Trump administration officials say the new ventilators could still prove valuable if the virus outbreak were to intensify into a second wave after the warm summer months “It’s very important that we have a completely refreshed and a comprehensive stockpile going into the fall” Dr Deborah Birx a medical adviser on the White House Coronavirus Task Force said at a briefing on April 21 “I think that’s why we’ve continued to bring in those shipments and work on the ventilators so that those would be available not only for the United States but certainly if other partner countries have this level of tragedy” Trump said he intends to ship thousands of the breathing machines overseas where the needs are greater On Tuesday Mexico said it received a shipment of ventilators from the United States Trump said last week Russia is also set to receive US ventilators along with other countries “People dying because they don’t have ventilators and they’re not equipped to do what we did” Trump said Friday “So we’re giving thousands and thousands of these ventilators away to many countries that have suffered greatly Italy France Spain so many countries And Nigeria called Tremendous problems in Nigeria Tremendous problems all over And so they’re very happy”  Krisher reported from Detroit Associated Press writer Marina Villeneuve in Albany New York contributed to this report  Follow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at

{"8406": "WASHINGTON AP — For weeks the Trump administration played up the dangers of the coronavirus as it sought to persuade Americans to disrupt their lives and stay home Now as President Donald Trump aims for a swift nationwide reopening he faces a new challenge convincing people it’s safe to come out and resume their normal lives It’s a defining question for a cloistered nation — and a political imperative for Trump whose reelection likely rides on the pace of an economic rebound Can the country move beyond a crippling fear of the virus and return to some modified version of its old routines doing what’s possible to mitigate the risk of COVID19 but acknowledging it may be a fact of life for years to come “We need to create the kind of confidence in America that makes it so that everybody goes back to work” said Kevin Hassett a White House adviser and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers “And that confidence is going to require testing and confidence that your workplace is a healthy place but also confidence in the economy” At the White House officials believe they’ve entered a new chapter of the pandemic response moving from crisis mode to sustained mitigation and management It began last Thursday with the release of guidelines to governors for how to safely reopen their states Trump and Vice President Mike Pence celebrated Americans for successfully “flattening the curve” of the epidemic A day later a phalanx of the administration’s top medical officials sought to reassure the nation that there were plenty of tests available to safely begin easing restrictions Governors have been lifting restrictions each day since then including aggressive moves announced Wednesday in Montana and Oklahoma The Montana governor gave schools the green light to open their doors in early May and Oklahoma will allow salons barbershops spas and pet groomers to reopen Friday Trump in his evening news conference did take issue with Republican Georgia Gov Brian Kemp’s bold reopening plans “I disagree strongly” he said “I think it’s too soon” The governors’ moves coincided with lingering bleak news around the country The death toll in Massachusetts eclipsed 2000 on Wednesday doubling from just a week earlier About 16000 people remained hospitalized across New York A meat plant in Iowa that is vital to the nation’s pork supply is the latest slaughterhouse to shut down because of outbreak With the economy in for a long brutal slump Congress was on the verge of passing an almost 500 billion relief bill to bolster small businesses Trump flatly promised Americans that there will no repeat of the national lockdown “We will not go through what we went through for the last two months” he said It’s a sharp shift in rhetoric after Trump and allies stressed the threat of an “invisible enemy” to persuade people to abide by social distancing recommendations The American people have also been scarred by the daunting death toll and images of body bags piled up in refrigerated trailers Moving from fear to acceptance will take confidence in government medical professionals and businesses at a time when faith in those institutions is low White House aides say restoring confidence will require the same “wholeofAmerica” approach that slowed the virus spread “It’s one thing for government to say ‘OK it’s safe to go out’’’ New York Gov Andrew Cuomo a Democrat said Tuesday “If people don’t believe it’s safe they’re not going to go” While there have been isolated protests in states aimed at lifting aggressive stayathome measures most Americans don’t believe it will be safe to ease the restrictions anytime soon according to a new survey from The Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research Trump predicted earlier this month that the economy would take off like a “rocket ship once we get back to business” But experts say the recovery will be far slower “It’ll be a very gradual process regardless of what a governor says or the president says” said Dr Robert Blendon a Harvard professor of health policy and political analysis He said the history of lockdowns particularly the quarantine of more than 25000 people around Toronto in 2003 to slow the spread of SARS shows that it will take weeks even months for people to develop the confidence to resume normal activity Blendon also warned that a predicted second wave of COVID19 could reverse any gains made in the interim It’s not just government but individual businesses that will need to convince employees and consumers that it’s safe to return once they decide to reopen The White House expects businesses “will advertise to the public” about the safety measures they are putting in place when they reopen said Larry Kudlow the director of the National Economic Council He said the White House is also considering asking Congress to provide liability protection for employers in case their workers or customers fall sick “We want small businesses to have some confidence that if they do reopen they’ll stay open” Kudlow said The outbreak has infected over 25 million people and killed about 180000 around the world including more than 46000 in the US according to a tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University from official government figures though the true numbers are believed to be far higher Mark Schlesinger a Yale professor of health policy said it’s going to take time “for people to reequilibrate emotionally and it’s very hard to predict how long” Even if people worried about their economic situation want to get back to work “There may be permanent behavioral changes in how people do business and interact as a society” At the White House the administration is adjusting its posture away from drastic containment measures to managing virus “flareups” and bottlenecks in testing or supplies And officials hope to use the daily White House briefings to inundate Americans with facts and figures on testing and therapeutics blanketing television with graphics of flattening and declining curves and statistics on the number of testing kits available White House officials also are planning to step up travel in coming weeks as a visual representation of reopening Pence has traveled to Colorado and Wisconsin in recent days and Trump is pushing aides to get him back on the road There are still plenty of caution flags “There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday “We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time” “We’ve got to be very careful” Trump said Tuesday of a potential second wave which in some predictions could hit just weeks before the November elections “We don’t want that to happen it could happen I think we stamp it out if it does happen” Instead White House aides hope that people accept a “new normal” that envisions shortterm disruptions when there are COVID19 cases causing routine weeklong school or office closures but not panic But Blendon said “People will watch the cases and listen to the major public health leaders and if there’s a conflict that will slow things even greater” "},

with concern over the spread of the virus has dropped from 51 last week to 46 this week according to the SWG polling agency The lessening of worry comes as the number of cases narrows and pressure on hospitals eases At the same time half of Italians say the virus crisis will last more than three months — a complete turnaround from March 11 when 72 were convinced the crisis would be over inside of 90 days Now twothirds say that in six months the virus will not be completely eradicated and “we will have to change our habits and behaviors in a definitive manner” the survey found Eightyfive

though the group has been traditional allies with the US for decades the EU has increasingly been critical of the Trump administration over the past years  BEIJING — A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman says the country is “seriously concerned” about the US government’s decision to suspend payment to the World Health Organization “As the most authoritative and professional international institution in the field of global public health security the WHO plays an irreplaceable role in responding to the global public health crisis” ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing on Wednesday President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he was cutting off US payments to the organization accusing it of failing to do enough to stop the virus from spreading when it first surfaced in China “The WHO failed in its basic duty and must be held accountable” Trump said at a briefing adding that the US would be reviewing the WHO’s actions to stop the virus before making any decision on resuming aid China wields major influence in the WHO allowing it to elect its favored candidate Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as directorgeneral blunt any criticism and block participation by rival Taiwan Zhao said the US decision will “weaken the WHO’s capabilities and undermine international cooperation in fighting the epidemic It will affect all countries in the world including the US especially those vulnerable to crisis”  MADRID — Spain has recorded 523 new deaths attributed to the coronavirus in the past 24 hours while infections shot up again for the first time in five days

{"7495": "WASHINGTON AP — President Donald Trump said he’s prepared to announce new guidelines allowing some states to quickly ease up on social distancing even as business leaders told him they need more coronavirus testing and personal protective equipment before people can safely go back to work The industry executives cautioned Trump that the return to normalcy will be anything but swift The new guidelines expected to be announced Thursday are aimed at clearing the way for an easing of restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus while keeping them in place in harderhit places The ultimate decisions will remain with governors “We’ll be opening some states much sooner than others” Trump said Wednesday But in a round of calls with business leaders earlier in the day Trump was warned that a dramatic increasing in testing and wider availability of protective equipment will be necessary for the safe restoration of their operations The new guidelines come as the federal government envisions a gradual recovery from the virus in which disruptive mitigation measures may be needed in some places at least until a vaccine is available — a milestone unlikely to be reached until next year Trump said at his daily briefing that data indicates the US is “past the peak” of the COVID19 epidemic clearing the way for his plans to roll out guidelines to begin to “reopen” the country He called the latest data “encouraging” saying the numbers have “put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country” Dr Deborah Birx the White House coronavirus task force coordinator added that data from across the country showed the nation “improving” but that Americans had to recommit to social distancing to keep up the positive momentum She said nine states have fewer than 1000 cases and just a few dozen new cases per day She said those would likely be the first to see a lifting in social distancing restrictions at the direction of their governors under the guidelines set to be released Thursday Birx said the White House was particularly concerned about Rhode Island noting it is now seeing a surge in cases from the Boston metro area after seeing a spike several weeks ago from cases from New York Trump consulted dozens of highprofile CEOs union officials and other executives via conference calls Wednesday He received a mixed message from the industry leaders They too said they want to get the economy going but had worries about how to safely do so In a tweet midway through Trump’s round of conference calls with the executives the president said the participants were “allin on getting America back to work and soon” But participants in a morning call that included dozens of leading American companies raised concerns about the testing issue according to one participant who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private discussion Another person who participated in Wednesday’s calls said it was stressed to Trump that expansion of testing and contact tracing was crucial as well as guidelines for best practices on reopening businesses in phases or in one fell swoop The participant said those on the call noted to the administration that there was about to be a massive rush on personal protective equipment Many businesses that are now shuttered will need the protective equipment to keep their employees and customers safe Trump was told “the economy will look very different and operations will look very different” one participant said Mark Cuban the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks was among several representatives from major sports leagues to speak with Trump During a Fox News Channel interview ahead of the calls he credited the president with gathering some of the “best of the best” to help shape his approach on reopening the economy Still Cuban did not embrace Trump’s push to reopen parts of the economy May 1 “This is such a moving target that I think the biggest mistake we can make is rush to a decision” said Cuban who previously had been critical of Trump’s response to the pandemic “But I’m going to help him in every way I can whatever he needs me to do” The panel which Trump dubbed the new Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups also could help give Trump a measure of cover If cases surge once restrictions are lifted as many experts have warned Trump will be able to tell the public he didn’t act alone and the nation’s top minds — from manufacturing to defense to technology — helped shape the plan Rich Nolan president and CEO of the National Mining Association who participated in one of the calls with Trump said there was also discussion about tax relief as well as “making sure that people are optimistic about the economy and they feel safe coming back to work” “I think you’ll see steps to reopen the country at different rates in different states in the not too distant future” Nolan said The launch of the council was not without hiccups AFLCIO President Richard Trumka didn’t know until he heard his name announced in the Rose Garden on Tuesday that he would be part of the advisory group according to Carolyn Bobb a spokeswoman for the union “We were not asked” Bobb said in an email It was “just announced” Maryland Gov Larry Hogan said Trump has appointed some “smart people” to his task force who could offer state leaders helpful guidelines as they negotiate the way forward “There are certain roles that only the federal government can play and should play but I think the governors are going to make their own decisions within those recommended guidelines” Hogan said "},
{"5914": "WASHINGTON AP — Congress delivered a nearly 500 billion infusion of coronavirus spending Thursday rushing new relief to employers and hospitals buckling under the strain of a pandemic that has claimed almost 50000 American lives and one in six US jobs The measure passed almost unanimously but the lopsided tally belies a potentially bumpier path ahead as battle lines are being formed for much more ambitious future legislation that may prove far more difficult to maneuver through Congress The bipartisan measure neared passage as lawmakers gathered in Washington as a group for the first time since March 27 adopting stricter social distancing rules while seeking to prove they can do their work despite the COVID19 crisis Lawmakers’ face masks and bandannas added an somber tone to their effort to aid a nation staggered by the health crisis and devastating economic costs of the pandemic “Millions of people out of work” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif “This is really a very very very sad day We come to the floor with nearly 50000 deaths a huge number of people impacted and the uncertainty of it all We hope to soon get to a recovery phase But right now we’re still in mitigation” Anchoring the bill is the Trump administration’s 250 billion funding request to replenish a fund to help small and mediumsize businesses with payroll rent and other expenses The payroll program provides forgivable loans so businesses can continue paying workers while forced to stay closed for social distancing and stayathome orders It also contains 100 billion demanded by Democrats for hospitals and a nationwide testing program along with a 60 billion setaside for small banks and an alternative network of community development banks that focus on development in urban neighborhoods and rural areas ignored by many lenders There’s also 60 billion for smallbusiness loans and grants delivered through the Small Business Administration’s existing disaster aid program President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage at his daily White House briefing Thursday “At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll” he said The 3885 vote — with Rep Justin Amash IMich voting “present” — came at the end of a nettlesome path to passage Republicans sought immediate action on Trump’s “clean” request for the small business money — backed by powerful GOPleaning business groups — but Democrats demanded equal funding for their priorities frustrating Republicans who accused them of seeking leverage during the crisis Republicans said delays in replenishing the paycheck subsidy program probably pushed some struggling businesses over the edge into closure Signs of the pandemic were everywhere in the House chamber Thursday As Pelosi spoke from the floor she lowered a white scarf that had covered much of her face House Chaplain Patrick Conroy delivered the opening prayer wearing a yellow protective mask and most lawmakers and aides on the chamber’s sparsely populated floor wore masks as well With the entire Capitol closed to the public visitors’ galleries were set aside for lawmakers in an effort to separate them Passage of more coronavirus relief is likely in the weeks ahead Supporters are already warning that the businessbacked Payroll Protection Program will exhaust the new 250 billion almost immediately Launched just weeks ago the program quickly reached its lending limit after approving nearly 17 million loans That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help Pelosi and allies like Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal DMass said the next measure will distribute more relief to individuals extend more generous jobless benefits into the fall provide another round of direct payments to most people and help those who are laid off afford health insurance through COBRA Democrats tried to win another round of funding for state and local governments in Thursday’s bill but were rebuffed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy who says he’s going to try pump the brakes on runaway deficit spending McConnell says he doesn’t want to bail out Democraticgoverned states for fiscal problems that predated the pandemic but there’s plenty of demand for state fiscal relief among Republicans too After the Senate passed the latest bill Tuesday McConnell declared that Republicans would entertain no more coronavirus rescue legislation until the Senate returns to Washington promising rankandfile Republicans greater say in the future legislation rather than leaving it in the hands of top bipartisan leaders Pelosi attacked McConnell for at first opposing adding any money to his original 250 billion package and saying cashstrapped states should be allowed to declare bankruptcy a move that they currently cannot do and that would threaten a broad range of state services McConnell’s comments provoked an outcry — including from GOP governors — and he later tempered his remarks “Oh really” Pelosi said “What made you think that was a good idea” Thursday’s measure brings total rescue funding over the four measures as measured by the cumulative deficit impact of spending proposals and tax cuts to 24 trillion according to the Congressional Budget Office Each day brings new evidence of the economic calamity wrought by the virus Thursday morning the government reported that 44 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week as layoffs sweep the economy Over the last five weeks roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid or about one in six US workers The state of Michigan announced this week that it is temporarily laying off almost 3000 workers All told the four coronavirus relief bills crafted by Congress would deliver at least 24 trillion for business relief testing and treatment and direct payments to individuals and the unemployed according to the Congressional Budget Office The deficit is virtually certain to breach 3 trillion this year and is likely to go well above that when CBO issues new data as early as Friday Among the candidates for aid in the next bill is the Postal Service which has more than 600000 workers but is getting clobbered by COVID19related revenue losses In related matter the House used a partyline 212182 vote Thursday to establish a special committee to oversee how the Trump administration spends the huge sums of money Congress is providing to battle the coronavirus Republicans accused Democrats of playing politics with the crisis but Democrats said Congress needs to keep an eye on the effort "}
