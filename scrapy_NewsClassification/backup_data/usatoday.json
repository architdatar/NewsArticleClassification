{"2369": "NEW YORK — The   pandemic has added an important duty to Dr Mitchell Katzs job as head of the   the nations largest public health care system Before going to sleep after marathon days he checks to make sure each of the 11 acute care hospitals he oversees has enough ventilators to help critically ill COVID19 patients breathe That will not go beyond Sunday when we will exhaust our supply Katz said during a news conference earlier this week with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio But on Thursday New York Gov Andrew Cuomo said the state had shipped 400 ventilators providing a few more days of capacity  Still the need remains dire and growing as coronavirus sufferers crowd hospitals The shortage is forcing health care officials in New York City to weigh ethical questions about who should get priority Their counterparts across the nation may soon face the same dilemma as the pandemic surges x There are no national guidelines for allocating scarce health care resources such as ventilators and hospital intensive care beds in times of crisis though a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee has   that states could use in allocating ventilators during a health crisis Many states have created their own plans to guide emergency decisionmaking Some were designed to deal with influenza outbreaks both a moderate epidemic and a global crisis on the order of the 1918 flu pandemic Those guidelines are being adapted to help allocate increasingly scarce critical care resources for the thousands of COVID19 patients admitted to hospitals Its very simple math We dont have enough equipment for everyone who needs it said Dr Calvin Sun an emergency care doctor who covers shifts in hospitals across New York City About 2500 to 3000 additional ventilators are needed to get all city hospitals through next week de Blasio said The city hopes to get some of them from the roughly 10000 that President Donald Trump has said are in the nations   for distribution to coronavirus hotspots Friday de Blasio pleaded for additional machines stressing that his city is the US epicenter of the pandemic They should have had more ventilators Trump said Friday night when asked about the issue Separately questions have been raised about the condition of the federal ventilators California Gov Gavin Newsom   that 170 of the units had arrived broken More than 2100 of the stockpile machines   The New York Times reported  If a person comes in and needs a ventilator and we dont have a ventilator the person dies Cuomo said Thursday He warned that the   and outlined plans to repurpose other machines for COVID19 patients Thats the blunt equation were dealing with Friday Cuomo issued an executive order authorizing the states National Guard to bring unused ventilators from upstate hospitals to those in New York City He estimated that would bring in several hundred units The state will return the units later or pay for them  If they want to sue me for borrowing their excess ventilators to save lives let them sue me said Cuomo The state received some welcome and unexpected relief on Saturday The government of the Peoples Republic of China  that were expected to arrive at John F Kennedy International Airport within hours Cuomo announced He thanked Alibaba Group cofounders Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai along with Huang Ping the ambassador at Chinas New York consulate After hearing about New Yorks ventilator scarcity Oregon Gov Kate Brown sent 140 units Cuomo called the unsolicited loan kind and smart because the move will help check the pandemic that threatens the entire nation New York hospitals have implemented other emergency measures including using a single ventilator to help two COVID19 patients breathe Known as splitting the procedure can be risky for some patients Hospitals are repurposing anesthesia machines as ventilators and are using   which are sometimes used to treat obstructive sleep apnea   Deciding who gets priority for ventilators and other critical health care equipment should be addressed in advance not in the midst of a pandemic said   a research scholar at   a bioethics center in Garrison New York When you have a situation where youre going to have more patients than there are resources you need a way to allocate those resources fairly Berlinger said No one wants to use these plans But no one thinks this should be an ad hoc decision either A group of medical ethics experts offered some recommendations in a   in late March They said the dwindling number of ventilators and available beds in hospital intensive care units during the coronavirus pandemic may mean giving priority to younger patients and those with fewer coexisting conditions How many years of life you save is a relevant ethical concern said Dr Ezekiel Emanuel one of the papers authors and a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine Ventilators intensive care beds and other emergency health care resources should go first to frontline health care workers and others who care for ill patients the experts recommended And patients with similar prognoses should get access to the emergency resources through random selection they said The word coronavirus doesnt appear in states emergency plans Emanuel the bioethics expert declined to discuss individual plans but said there are certainly some that are better than others USA TODAY reviewed a sampling of 10 plans from around the country In   a patient meets the exclusion criteria — meaning that limited resources will be withheld — if he or she suffers from severe dementia incurable malignancy or endstage multiple sclerosis or if the patient is at least 90 years old In   and   a colorcoded chart helps doctors determine which patients are eligible for intensive care or a ventilator The coding is based in part on an assessment of the extent of a patients organ failure a protocol cited in several of the state plans Patients assigned green or yellow get treatment Those coded red may be excluded if resources are exhausted Those coded blue begin palliative care designed to reduce suffering prior to death  warns bluntly “There will be marked shortages of staff and resources” and it says assistance from other states and the federal government will be limited Similarly the   says there may be shortages of gloves respirators ventilators and laboratory testing supplies   says hospitals might be required to report every 12 hours on available beds including intensive care unit and ventilator beds during later stages of a major health crisis  The Minnesota Department of Healths  recommend patients remain on ventilators if they have a low likelihood of dying a good medical prognosis no significant underlying diseases and breathing improvement over time And if a patient doesnt meet those conditions the ventilator could be moved to someone else A Minnesota   panel spent months studying rationing protocols to cope with an illness far deadlier than the seasonal flu one capable of killing 38000 residents Like other states the panel ruled out lifeordeath decisions based on gender race religion citizenship and a patients finances or societal value The panel concluded that health care and public safety workers should receive priority care It might be appropriate to prioritize children in a situation where adults and children both need scarce equipment the panel said And if it came down to two patients with equal scores needing a single piece of equipment the panel said the decision should not be made on a firstcome firstserved basis A more random technique such as a lottery or flipping a coin should be used instead the panel advised A New York state task force spent two years drawing up ventilator allocation guidelines for   Some other states drew on the recommendations when they drew up their own plans  The recommendations suggest a random process for deciding who gets a ventilator and evaluating patients after 48 hours and 120 hours on the machines A firstcome firstserved process could disadvantage lower income patients who might not have as much information about a pandemic as well as minority communities who might initially avoid going to a hospital because of distrust of the healthcare system the guidelines say A patients doctor should not make the allocation decision the guidelines recommend Instead a triage panel or officer should decide Thursday night as the ventilator shortage in New York City neared a crisis point the president of the Medical Society of the State of New York issued   Dr Art Fougner wrote that some emergency doctors faced with ventilator decisions have said theyve been told the equivalent of Use your best judgment Youre on your own Instead he recommended referring to the states ventilator guidelines Hospitals he wrote should empower their ethics committees to have a system to respond urgently to requests for guidance when the need arises so that no physician need bear this terrible burden alone Those guidelines appeared to be littleknown among New York City hospital staffers before the coronavirus pandemic said Sun the emergency care doctor No longer Now its being circulated around and discussed by everyone Sun said after getting off a 12hour shift Wednesday night They can see whats happening Hospitals are now ending shifts with one or two ventilators available Although he normally prefers short summaries of medical issues Sun said he appreciates the research that went into New Yorks ventilator allocation guidelines He warned however that decisions about placing patients on ventilators — or removing them — must be made quickly I dont have the luxury of waiting hours Sun said I have minutes or seconds "},

{"1691": "WASHINGTON — Governors warnings of lifethreatening shortages of ventilators have emerged as a flashpoint between  and the states as the coronavirus crisis deepens Some states have more ventilators than they need Trump told a news briefing Saturday They dont even like to admit it Theyll admit it when everythings over but that doesnt help us very much“ Governors in hardhit states like New York Michigan and Louisiana say doctors could be forced to make life or death decisions about who will get ventilators and who wont if hospitals starting running out of the machines when the peak of the crisis hits Louisiana Gov John Bel Edwards has said his state is expected to exhaust its supply of ventilators by April 6 Though Louisiana has received some ventilators from the national stockpile Edwards said his state still needs thousands more New York  has estimated his state will need as many as 30000 ventilators and could start facing shortages by the middle of next week Cuomo dismissed the suggestion that he was overstating the needs He said New York was prepared to pay for 17000 ventilators it had ordered on its own but didnt get them because of competing demands We were not looking to spend a penny that we didnt have to spend Cuomo said       Without naming a specific governor Trump said Saturday he was frustrated that some states that have already received ventilators from the federal government were insisting they needed more  And then the media meets with the governor and they say Oh you got more Well its not enough The president should have sent more Trump said adding thats politics The tensions between governors and the Trump administration grew this week when   a senior White House adviser and the presidents soninlaw referred to the federal stockpile of medical supplies as our stockpile Its not supposed to be states stockpiles that they then use he said Trump has said the federal government is ready to help the states but needs the flexibility of moving the ventilators to virus hot spots He and his aides say the administration will mobilize the equipment to areas where its most needed days in advance but theyre also urging states to tap their own stockpiles and do what they can to obtain their own supplies Several governors want the federal government to use its clout to buy more ventilators The Federal Emergency Management Agency could then distribute to states in the greatest need the governors argue Why would you create a situation where the 50 states are competing with each other and then the federal government FEMA comes in and competes with the rest of it Cuomo asked Illinois Gov JB Pritzker and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer have also expressed frustration over competing against one another – and the federal government – in bidding for supplies in the private market which has led to pricegouging So how many ventilators are likely to be needed how many are there now and why are they in such short supply Heres an overview of what led to the problems and the debate over how to solve them  Trump has declared the US would produce 100000 ventilators in 100 days and told reporters Thursday that 11 companies were behind the effort to expedite production While General Motors and Ford have said they would manufacture ventilators it wasnt immediately clear what other companies were producing the machines  Most of the 100000 ventilators Trump promised to have by June will not be available until the end of the month at the earliest FEMA officials told the House Oversight Committee this week  FEMA said there were just 9500 ventilators in the national stockpile with about 3200 expected to be added by the week of April 13   released by the committees Democrats  The US coronavirus crisis is projected to peak by the middle of April when nearly 32000 ventilators will be needed to address the outbreak according to data from   FEMA acknowledges that the Strategic National Stockpile SNS alone could not fulfill all requirements at the State and tribal level in response to the coronavirus pandemic according to an agency spokesperson FEMA officials have told the House Oversight Committee the demand for ventilators outstrips the capacity of the national stockpile as well as the 1065 machines donated by the Department of Defense As of April 2 FEMA officials have shipped 8100 ventilators from the national stockpile a FEMA spokesperson said adding that the agency is expediting critical medical supplies from the global market to medical distributors across the country  Six flights carrying medical supplies from Asia have arrived in the US since March 29 including two flights that arrived Chicago and Columbus Ohio early on Friday according to the FEMA spokesperson The agency has scheduled 27 additional flights through April 18  The medical supplies will be given first to medical distributors in areas of greatest need and the remainder will be infused into the broader US supply chain the FEMA spokesperson said  FEMA also points to the 16 billion allocated to build up the stockpile in the 2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress last week that will help address the shortage  The Strategic National Stockpile which is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services consists of several secretly located warehouses across the US that contain emergency medical supplies  Former Wisconsin Gov Tommy Thompson who served as health secretary under former President George W Bush and oversaw the response to outbreaks of anthrax SARS and Monkeypox said the number of warehouses was expanded to 12 from eight after the 911 attacks  Thompson who said he offered a federal plan for preparation for a pandemic before he left office said Congress failed to appropriate funding to replenish the depleted stockpiles over the years  They were maintained but they were not expanded he told USA TODAY I think it was lack of attention I dont think you blame the governors I dont think you blame the president I think that everybody neglected filling these sites with what was needed Greg Burel who served as head of the SNS for more than 12 years before he retired in January said the stockpile was not initially designed for pandemic influenza but Congress began investing funds in preparation for such an event in the early 2000s  We always knew that even then it wasnt as much as some of the models suggested we would need if it was a 1918 sort of an event he said referring to the flu pandemic of 1918 Even with the pandemic influenza money it was going to be almost impossible fiscally to stockpile our way out of that kind of a problem Trump has said federal governments stockpile can help the country through the crisis but has also criticized  for equipment and not doing enough to build their own supplies “States should have been building their stockpiles” he added “We’re a backup we’re not an ordering clerk” he said But the existence of the stockpile is aimed directly at helping states according to Josh Gotbaum a former assistant secretary of defense for economic security and executive associate director for Office of Management and Budget under former President Bill Clinton  The whole purpose of emergency stockpiles is to protect the nation in an emergency Even if the stockpiles are inadequate they still must be used for the entire nation he said Its not to make sure theres enough ventilators for the Army Navy Air Force and Marines The Defense Department already takes care of that   Cuomo said Friday the government should send more ventilators and medical supplies that New York could then redeploy to other hardhit localities where demand is surging  What is the alternative to the crisis that we see looming nationwide he said New York is in crisis Help New York and then pick up the camp and go to the next place as this rolls across the country Thompson said while Cuomo and other governors are rightly focused on their states Trump has to assess where the lifesaving machines are needed most across the country  The stockpiles are federalthe president is responsible for all the states Thompson said So hes got to make that tough decision Trump has shown ambivalence about using the full authority of the Korean Warera Defense Production Act to compel private companies to make ventilators masks and other equipment He has at times likened the wartime authority to nationalization of private industry and invoked Venezuelas economy as an example of the dangers of the approach While Trump announced a week ago that he was activating the DPA to force General Motors to manufacture ventilators for coronavirus the administration had not formally ordered any machines as of Thursday  Trump this week announced a fresh request to Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar to use the act for several other companies including General Electric HillRom Holdings Medtronic ResMed Royal Philips and Vyaire Medical But the latest order provided no more detail on how the government would compel those companies to make ventilators than the order targeted at General Motors The order also did not clarify how many ventilators the administration is requesting"},

{"3008": "With Congress in gridlock over a second stimulus bill to provide coronavirus relief President Donald Trump issued   Aug 8 Shortly after critics took to social media questioning the actions’ legality One of those critics was former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich who  his take on the actions a day after the news was announced “Your reminder that a president cannot spend taxpayer dollars by executive order” the tweet read Reich later shared the same  on his Facebook with the caption “That’s not how this works” Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle criticized Trumps move as well Sen Ben Sasse RNeb called the orders “ ” and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif called them “ ” that don’t “even accomplish what he sets out to do” Reich did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment The   grants Congress the country’s spending power   a constitutional law expert teaching at Georgetown University said that means the president cannot spend money without congressional authorization whether by executive order or presidential memorandum or anything else However Congress can provide money that is contingent on the president releasing it in which case an executive order could release funds if that’s what Congress called for he said “Congress could pass a law saying ‘Give this money to the farmers in Iowa’ in which case the farmers get the money Or Congress could say ‘Give this money to the farmers in Iowa if you find they need it’” Super said “In that case the money wouldnt go out unless and until the president made a finding that it was needed and if he did make that finding then it would go out” In “ ” constitutional expert Louis Fisher breaks down several examples of presidents exercising the power to decide what money goes where with contingency funds sometimes in ways that weren’t appropriated by Congress In 1961 for example President John F Kennedy issued an executive order establishing the Peace Corps The agency wasn’t appropriated funding until seven months later but in the meantime Kennedy financed the corps by using over a million dollars in contingency funds from the Mutual Security Act Congress has moved before to curb abuse of contingency funds by the executive branch Fisher wrote that in 1959 a subcommittee in the House specifically denied funding for an Incentive Investment Program proposed by the executive administration That denial was omitted from the final appropriation bill passed by Congress and the president used his contingency fund to start the program anyways The House Appropriations Committee claimed that the president was using the contingency fund to override the actions of Congress so in a later bill it was written that no funds appropriated for the president’s contingency fund “shall be used for any project or activity for which an estimate has been submitted to Congress and which estimate has been rejected” Generally presidents are not allowed to shuffle around contingency funds Super said If a president decided he wanted to move money from our imaginary contingency fund for Iowa farmers and give it to Texas health care workers that wouldn’t be allowed But the lines have been blurred before it happened recently with the funding for Trump’s border wall “Congress in various defense and national security statutes has given the president a fair amount of authority to shift things around” Super said “There is fairly broad authority specifically in the national security statutes to allow responding to fast changing war conditions and Trump used that to build a border wall which isnt really a military thing and thats why theres been litigation about that I think people have the notion the president can push things around because of that” John Hudak a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution told   a similar story when addressing the claim that US presidents cannot spend taxpayer money with executive orders “A blanket statement like that is incorrect” he told AFP “It is not typically common that funds are spent at the direction of an executive order” but “there is not a blanket prohibition on that behavior”  While none of the   hold much   Super said the unemployment memorandum is “the one that really matters” as it’s the only executive action of the four clearly trying to spend funds in a way Congress had not anticipated or appropriated That memo allows for states to provide up to 400 per week in expanded unemployment benefits 75 of which would be moved from the federal government’s federal disaster relief fund and 25 of which is expected to come out of the states’ pockets Although there is   of the action Treasury Secretary Steve Mnunchin said all four executive actions were  by the Office of Legal Counsel Even if it isn’t legal it’s unlikely the actions will be challenged in court primarily due to the fact that withholding aid in a pandemic is a bad look politically If the Democrats want to challenge us in court and hold up unemployment benefits to those hardworking Americans that are out of a job because of COVID theyre going to have a lot of explaining to do Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on Aug 9 But that doesn’t mean there’s no chance legal action might be taken Super said the House could sue or more likely states could sue to get clarity as to whether they will be paid Right now all states have is the administration’s word — and the administration can’t commit funds without congressional authorization “If the state believes and I frankly think this is the case that this is unlawful — that the president didnt have authority to issue that memorandum on unemployment because Congress has provided for unemployment and disastrous situations and the president is violating the terms of what Congress set out — then in that case I think that a state could say ‘Were not going to go forward with this unless we have a court decision that confirms that this is lawful and that if we do it we will get paid” he said If the action is not challenged it might set a precedent that makes the role of the president more powerful in the future “I think there have been lots of situations when there were benefits that presidents of different parties have wanted to give to particular constituencies and if President Trump goes forward with this and there isnt anything challenging then I think next time a Democratic president wants to provide a benefit — you know wants to increase food stamp benefits or wants to broaden the Medicaid eligibility or something like that — theyre going to feel a lot more free to do so Super said And in their case like in this one it will be hard to sue them because there will be not much of anybody whos adversely affected — except the Constitution which unfortunately doesnt have any lawyers” The claim that a president cannot spend taxpayer dollars by executive order is MISSING CONTEXT Its true that the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse meaning the president cannot spend money without Congress appropriating it But there are scenarios in which executive orders could be used to disperse funds particularly from contingency funds And Congress has given the president latitude to shift things around  "},

China to South Korea Italy and Iran the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  and cause severe disruptions across the country At a news conference the same day in India President Donald Trump tried to tamp down concerns saying the virus was very well under control in our country The White House requested 25 billion in emergency funding this week to combat the outbreak but congressional Democrats slammed the request as woefully insufficient Heres what the president said Wednesday evening and what the facts are Minutes after Trump downplayed the risk of coronavirus spreading in the United States   that might be the nation’s first example of a non travelrelated case of coronavirus There’s a chance that it could get worse” Trump said “There’s a chance that it could get fairly substantially worse But I don’t think it’s inevitable  there’s a chance that it won’t spread   Less than an hour later the CDC confirmed the California case involving a person who did not travel to China and was not known to be exposed to another person there with the virus The CDC said it’s unknown how the person was exposed to COVID19 but the agency said it could be the first example of “community spread” which means an unknown source of infection The agency has not ruled out that the person was exposed to a traveler with the virus The first 14 cases confirmed in the United States included 12 travelers returning from China and two individuals who had close contact with those travelers The California man is the 15th confirmed case not counting infected passengers from Diamond

That was shocking to me According to the CDC there have been at least 29 million flu illnesses and 16000 deaths from flu so far this season The season is not yet over but the number of estimated flu deaths so far this year is below the range that Trump cited  The CDC reported annual flu deaths ranged from   slightly lower than figured the president cited  Trump again compared coronavirus to the flu and predicted a vaccine will soon be available “We’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner” he said Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases also spoke at the news conference and offered a more specific time frame for efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine He said it will take about two months to determine whether a vaccine is safe through a small study in humans That would be followed another six to eight months to conduct a larger comprehensive medical study to gauge whether the vaccine works   During a Feb 17 meeting with USA TODAY’s editorial board meeting Fauci said it   to make a vaccine that is safe and effective and ready to distribute “The solution to the containment of this current outbreak will not be a vaccine” Fauci said Still Fauci said the vaccine will be important and would be useful if COVID19 returns next year as a seasonal respiratory virus Several drugmakers are working to develop vaccines and other treatments to combat coronavirus Gilead Sciences a pharmaceutical company is testing the antiviral drug remdesivir as a potential coronavirus treatment in several countries The experimental drug was also used on a suburban  Seattle man who became the nation’s first coronavirus patient “Johns Hopkins  they did a study a comprehensive – the countries best and worst prepared for an epidemic – and the United States we’re rated No 1” Trump said Trump was referring to the October 2019 Global Health Security Index by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Nuclear Threat Initiative with research by The Economist Intelligence Unit The report evaluated the health security capabilities of 195 countries While the US ranked No1 overall the report found that not a single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic The United States scored in the bottom tier of countries for access to health care “owing to lack of

response cited his experience handling MERS in Indiana where the first US case was confirmed In May 2014 CDC confirmed two cases of MERS Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the United States – one in Indiana the other to Florida Both cases were health care providers who lived and worked in Saudi Arabia and traveled to the United States Both were hospitalized in the US and later discharged after fully recovering MERS which originated in Saudi Arabia resulted in 2499 cases and 861 deaths worldwide a fatality rate far higher than SARS or COVID19    Trump lauded Pence’s record on health care when he was governor of Indiana Everybody who knows anything about health care they look at Indiana he said They’ve established a great health care in Indiana … a lot of other states have looked to They wanted to change their health care systems In 2015 Indiana implemented sweeping changes to the state’s Medicaid insurance program requiring lowincome adults to pay monthly premiums to maintain their health insurance coverage The reforms were spearheaded by Pence and thenhealth policy consultant Seema Verma who now oversees the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Republican governors in states including Kentucky and Arizona also sought federal approval for similar restrictions arguing such incentives encouraged ablebodied adults to seek employment and helped curb unnecessary health spending But critics said such restrictions were unnecessarily punitive and put vulnerable people at risk of losing their health coverage In October facing a federal lawsuit challenging the states work requirement Indiana said it would  for those who failed to meet the work requirement  Also during Pence’s tenure a small town in Indiana   In all 235 people became infected giving Austin Indiana an HIV infection rate rivaling nations in subSaharan Africa The Pence administration was criticized for its slow response and   to slow new cases of HIV and hepatitis C infections   Trump faced several questions from reporters about the stock market as US stocks slumped for a fifth straight session on Wednesday The President suggested the Democratic debates played a role in the fall “I

{"7763": "WASHINGTON – President  he wants to curtail the strict social distancing guidelines his administration put in place to slow the   because of the potential impact on the US economy  But Trump is not the only executive to take action in the hope of flattening the curve the term medical experts use to describe a slow and steady rise in the number of cases of COVID19 rather than a sharp spike that could overwhelm the nations healthcare system  As the president weighs loosening the federal guidance he does so against a backdrop of governors who have implemented their own statewide – and independent – restrictions from curfews to lockdowns to sweeping school and business closures “We’re going to be opening relatively soon” Trump said during a Fox News town hall Tuesday “Id love to have it open by Easter  Its such an important day for other reasons but Ill make an important date for this too I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter”  But does Trump have the authority to revoke or alter that guidance And what impact would the move have on workfromhome orders signed by state governors Trump announced guidelines March 16 aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus Officials describe the effort as   of new cases The guidelines called on Americans to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people and suggested that states with community transmission close their schools bars restaurants and other businesses The guidelines also recommended seniors stay home and avoid contact with other people that Americans avoid discretionary travel shopping trips and social visits and that customers use drivethru pickup and delivery options instead of eating out The federal guidelines are just that – guidelines They are not mandatory but both the president and public health officials have previously said that following them is critically important to slowing the spread of the virus Many private companies school districts and medical facilities have been honoring the guidelines   with the federal guidelines and their potential impact on the US economy In a lengthy press conference on Monday the president shifted his message significantly and argued that the cure of the virus shouldnt come at the cost of a massive economic slowdown He did not say specifically when he will lift the guidelines but suggested it would be a matter of weeks and not months  Our countrys not built to shut down Trump said Tuesday during the Fox News town hall You can destroy a country this way by closing it down  The guidelines were already set to expire early next week  Because the guidelines are not mandatory the president has wide latitude to adjust them as he sees fit Trump indicated this week that the guidelines could be tailored for different states with more hardhit areas facing tougher recommendations while states with few cases potentially returning to normal While Trump can set the guidelines however he wants states and private industries are not required to honor them   States with stayathome orders made by their governors could continue those orders  regardless of whether Trump lifts the federal guidelines  As of Tuesday at least 17 states have stayathome orders in place and at least 10 others have some cities or counties that have issued their own orders Each state has their own rules in place for how long the orders last For example Ohio Gov Mike DeWine’s stayathome order is set until April 6 while some governors have not given an exact date that the order will end In addition to stayathome orders several states have closed school for several weeks or even until the end of the school year such as Virginia and Kansas Those orders also could stay in place if Trump lifts the federal guidelines We are at war   when announcing his executive order to have Ohioans stay home And in a time of war we have to make sacrifices The countrys public health law is a patchwork of responsibilities divided up between the federal and state governments but typically states are in control of police powers according to Professor Glenn Cohen faculty director for the PetrieFlom Center for Health Law Policy Biotechnology  Bioethics at Harvard Law School Some states even delegate those powers to individual localities  But if Trump decides to lift the federal guidance states like California or New York that have issued stayathome orders may decide to follow suit or not but typically have significant discretion as to what to do he said  While legally states remain largely independent of the president and the federal government in regards to these measures governors and state health officials may face political pressures in defying the federal governments guidelines  The president and his economic advisers have shown they are eager to roll back the 15 Day to Slow the Spread initiative as economists warn of a dramatic economic contraction in the months ahead Investment banking giant Morgan Stanley reported over the weekend the economy could shrink by 301 in the second quarter The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost more than three years of gains  But loosening restrictions too early and resuming public life could lead to tighter crackdown in the future according to Jay Shambaugh director of The Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution  The whole point is to lock down until you control the virus Shambaugh said Anything you do to kind of erase the gains youre trying to get by controlling the virus its not just that it has health consequences it requires further lockdown later on  Trump has suggested parts of the country where there hasnt been a large outbreak could resume normal activities in the coming weeks while New York Gov Andrew Cuomo has floated the idea that younger healthier people could return to work while more atrisk populations remain at home  Shambaugh argues the question is not when the US should begin lifting restrictions in an effort to revive the economy The question instead should be to public health officials asking what the conditions are in which the country could return to work – whether thats a matter of increasing testing production quarantining or contact tracing like South Korea implemented in its effort to combat the spread of coronavirus  Should the president ease the federal guidelines while some states keep schools restaurants and businesses closed it may not revive the economy as much as it makes people take the restrictions less seriously Shambaugh added The economic pain is not something we can avoid simply by relaxing restrictions he said Millions of people have lost their jobs already That has an impact on the economy regardless of if we try to open things up immediately Health officials have stressed social distancing is a key part of stemming the spread of the virus to ensure hospitals are not overwhelmed amid medical supply shortages pointing to   as a warning of what could happen if a country is unprepared  Regardless of whether Trump reopens American business the economic repercussions are already underway Aside from the equity market wealth that has already been lost and the subsequent expected cutback in consumption over the next 12 months the contractions in Europe China and other places will also affect US economy according to Shambaugh  At this point there is just a massive sudden stop of finance flowing through emerging markets and thats going to cause a real kind of pain and chaos in a lot of emerging market economies and that also spills back over to the United States he said Under the US Constitution governors can issue their own policies to combat the coronavirus pandemic due to a provision called police powers that applies to states The law allows governors to issue orders to protect their citizens in emergencies including those dealing with public health Ross Baker a political science professor at Rutgers University said that if the federal government tried to step in and forbid governors from dealing with their problems within the boundaries the issue could end up at the Supreme Court “The Supreme Court would say that the federal government was commandeering the states which is something the court has specifically rejected” Baker said “Within the constitutional definition of police powers the states are doing exactly what they are properly doing” Although it will not be a legal issue it could cause widespread confusion across the nation if Trump does end a federal recommendation of a stayathome order but does not note exceptions for local orders Baker said the “public would be rightly rightly confused” “It will introduce a kind of confusion and chaos which would be really quite dangerous” he said"},

{"1744": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump assured the nation on Wednesday that the coronavirus task force put together by the White House was very ready to respond to growing concerns about the

for this for anything whether its going to be a breakout of larger proportions or whether were at that very low level Trump said at the press conference He added that he didn’t believe it was inevitable that the virus would spread in the United States but acknowledged that it “probably” would So why does the US need a coronavirus task force Whats all this talk of a public health czar And how can the administration address a potential public health crisis Heres what we know so far about how the White House is handling coronavirus The White House announced it had established a task force in late January to monitor contain and mitigate the spread of the virus while ensuring that the American people have the most accurate and uptodate health and travel information  It was headed up by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar a former pharmaceutical executive who was appointed by Trump about two years ago and comprised 11 other administration officials On Wednesday though Trump announced Pence would be in charge Thursday the vice president attended his first meeting to oversee the task force which he noted has met every day since it was established  The White House also announced that Ambassador Deborah Birx will be the coronavirus response coordinator Birx is a public health expert who worked in the State Department as the US global AIDS coordinator under the Obama and Trump administrations Also added to the task force Thursday are Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Surgeon General Jerome Adams and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow Theres been talk of the need for an individual to head up the governments response to the coronavirus who would devote their full attention to the issue also sometimes known as a czar in government Socalled czars have been employed in the past throughout the government to coordinate a response to significant issues The Trump administration must appoint a pointperson—a czar—to implement a real plan to manage

media creation and is shorthand for a highlevel official assigned to a policy matter though its hardly an official title John Holdren the senior science and technology adviser to former President Barack Obama told USA TODAY a czar should be “somebody who wakes up every morning thinking about how to fix that problem and nothing else” Trumps task force of more than a dozen members seemed without any such individual But in response to reporting by   that White House officials had been considering naming a coronavirus czar White House spokesperson Judd Deere said on   that this was false  This is not true Deere wrote The President took decisive action by creating the Coronavirus Virus Task Force a month ago and is pleased with the leadership of Azar to protect the public health Trump announced Pences role later the same day And Birxs title of White House coronavirus response coordinator reporting to Pence further muddles the question of leadership on the coronavirus front Azar has maintained he still holds the title of chairman and Pence says hes leading the group and he will will continue to rely on the secretarys Azars role according to pool reports from the task force

said he learned from that experience the importance of presidential leadership and of partnerships with state and local governments and health authorities in responding to dangerous infectious diseases But hes also drawn heavy criticism for his response to an epidemic of HIV infections among intravenous drug users in 2015 in his state  Pence initially opposed a needle exchange program in which users could exchange dirty needles that were the source of infection with clean ones provided by the government saying that it was akin to handing out drug paraphernalia It was his position despite the recommendation of public health officials and advocates that needle exchange could reduce rates of infection The state banned needle exchange and after significant backlash including from the CDC Pence declared a public health emergency in Scott County that allowed for needle exchange Physician Leana Wen a former Baltimore health commissioner and current visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University said coronavirus response will require quick decision making and pointed to Pences track record Wen said low public health funding and reluctance to allow a needle exchange were key reasons “HIV epidemic was raging on his watch” as governor She also praised the CDC’s warnings this week that Americans’ coronavirus risk remained low but would likely cause severe disruptions as it spreads in the United States “The CDC did exactly the right thing” Wen said “There will be cases in the US   I wish the president yesterday had supported the CDC’s message” Pence said at the task force meeting on Thursday that the risk to Americans as of now remains low But the coronavirus task force stands prepared to make sure that resources are available at the local and state levels Pence said on Wednesday Pence and the task force will be coordinating different governmental agencies in their preparations against coronavirus He said our containment strategy has been working He said the task force will be working with Congress on funding which has been a point of contention between Democrats who believe more funding should be allocated to address the virus and the administrations   Trump has since appeared willing to compromise on the amount I want to assure you in the days ahead the full resources of the government will be brought to bear” Pence said Thursday Pence says his role is to help lead this effort with the White House corona task force but also engage our governors engage local officials including mayors around the country and work with members of Congress on Capitol Hill to make sure that all the agencies represented here in our state and local partners have the resources they need” But the specifics of what the task force will do are still not clear Wen said that the officials tasked with responding to coronavirus will need to be quick in their decision making and inform their decisions with scientific evidence"},

{"2231": "WASHINGTON – Senate Republicans met Monday with senior Trump administration officials to discuss countering the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and came away with a sense of urgency to act Senators talked behind closed doors with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who has been the lead negotiator between the administration and the House and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow who attempted to ease concerns several Republicans have voiced with the pending coronavirus bill passed in the House Both officials underscored the need to pass the measure quickly “They understood” Kudlow said of senators after the meeting “They understood the urgency You know were trying to keep people from getting laid off And were trying to help people on sick leave or take care of their families whatever the case may be And weve got some pretty distressed industries” The officials also expanded on what is to come offering a preview of the next package the Trump administration wants Congress to take up that would help workers and families but also give a boost to the healthcare and airline industries Sen Marco Rubio RFla left the meeting with a sense of urgency noting the need to pass a third coronavirus package as soon as this week due to concerns the Senate might not be able to reconvene if the virus worsens “I dont think we can assume that we can keep reconvening the Senate every week like the way we did it this week I just dont think we can make that assumption with the orders that are out there what might happen with airlines with travel schedules with individual members having to go into quarantine or being exposed” he said “I dont think we can operate as if we can just bring the Senate and the House back together whenever we want” He said help for airlines would be central to the next package calling it a potential “national security threat” if airlines halt operations He said bailouts for specific industries differed from the financial rescue during the 2008 economic crisis The bank bailout proved unpopular with many Americans who viewed as unfair to help the companies whose risktaking sowed the seeds for the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression “This is not an example of industries that have failed and made bad decisions and are asking for the taxpayer to bail them out” Rubio said “We are asking  were begging people  not to go out not to go shopping not to go to restaurants not to go to bars and clubs and not to take trips We are imposing restrictions for – and rightfully so there is economic costs associated with that” The House of Representatives passed an amended version of its coronavirus legislation after allday negotiations and one lone Republican withdrawing his objection Rep Louie Gohmert RTexas blocked the bill from passing in the chamber under unanimous consent earlier Monday a move that could have forced the House to hold a full vote on technical changes it made to the legislation “The – what are being called  technical corrections make the bill better than it was when it got passed in the wee hours Saturday morning so because of that” Gohmert said on the House floor “I will withdraw my objection” The legislation will now move to the Senate If it passes it will head to Trump’s desk The bill will provide sick leave to American workers and bolster unemployment insurance along with making coronavirus tests free for all who need them Senators were considering Monday whether to add or change a coronavirus relief bill that passed the House Saturday That measure would require paid leave for workers who need to stay home because of the virus Sen Ron Johnson RWis has raised concerns that the bills provisions expanding paid sick leave would exacerbate financial hardships for small business by forcing them to pay wages they cannot afford Johnson said hes worried not only about potential layoffs but also about “incentivizing people to not show up for work either “People are going to have to work People do need to recognize the fact that this is not Ebola This is not MERS Its not quite the seasonal flu Johnson said But we have to keep things in perspective and we got to keep our economy In addition to the paid leave provisions the House measure would also increase money for food programs  Utah GOP Sen Mitt Romney said some of his colleagues are floating the option of adding to the relief measures in the House bill to address other sectors of the economy “There’s some who think ‘no no wed better do phase three at the same time’ because we may not you know be coming back if somebody gets the coronavirus or whatever happens” Romney said “Maybe we need to get phase three done before phase two is out the door” President Donald Trump meanwhile mentioned help for the struggling airline industry as among the priorities he is seeking in the next phase of the rescue package White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham is working from home in what she describes as an abundance of caution She was around members of the Brazilian delegation that visited MaraLago in early March I feel good but with my proximity to the president it’s better to be safe than sorry Grisham said in an email She did not say whether she will get a coronavirus test President Donald Trump acknowledged Monday that the US economy “may be” heading toward a recession because of the coronavirus but predicted growth would bounce back strongly “Well it may be” Trump said in the White House in response to a question about whether the economy is “headed” toward a recession “We’re not thinking in terms of recession We’re thinking in terms of the virus” the president continued “Once we stop I think there’s a tremendous pentup demand both in terms of the stock market in terms of the economy” The president’s remarks came as rising fears about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy sent   into freefall Monday The Dow Jones industrial average collapsed 2999 points or 129 to close at 2018852 – its second worst percentage loss in history behind the Black Monday crash in 1987 Unlike during his Rose Garden appearance on Friday when his decision to declare a national emergency appeared to drive prices up the presidents remarks Monday did not appear to ease investor concerns Instead the market selloff continued as the president and other officials suggested that Americans would have to continue to practice social distancing into the summer The benchmark Standard  Poors 500 index plunged 12 to finish at 238613 The broad index briefly triggered an automatic shock absorber for the third time in six sessions when it fell more than 7 shortly after the opening bell The technologyheavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 12 to end at 690459 one of its worst days ever The White House and congressional leaders have been negotiating over a series of stimulus proposals to offset losses caused by the virus but work on one of those measures appeared to slow in Congress this week over what House Democrats described as technical corrections to legislation approved early Saturday Several economists predict the US economy could be heading to a recession if the virus continues to disrupt Americans’ normal routines into the summer Kevin Hassett who previously served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Trump told CNN Monday that the odds of a global recession are close to 100 right now Vice President Mike   for the coronavirus he said Monday two days after the White House announced that the president’s test had come back negative Pence said that the White House physician advised that he did not need to get tested because he hadn’t had a long exposure to anyone who had been infected and neither he nor his wife Karen Pence have symptoms “I’ve not been tested yet” Pence said “But we’re checking our temperature regularly every day and we’ll continue to follow guidance” He used that point to emphasize that the priority for testing should be people with symptoms and health care workers People people should consult a doctor before getting tested he added “That’s what my family is doing as well” he said Before that disclosure at a White House briefing President Donald Trump was asked if he and Pence are trying to stay separate to protect the chain of command in case one of them gets sick “We haven’t thought about it Trump said  “We’re very careful We’re very careful with being together Even the people behind me They’ve been very strongly tested I’ve been very strongly tested” President Donald Trump appeared to suggest foreign groups could be behind a disinformation campaign that circulated rumors the government was close to placing the US on lockdown When asked if he agreed with US officials who warned that foreign entities are behind a disinformation campaign to stoke fears of a nationwide quarantine Trump said I think it could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games but it doesnt matter We havent really determined to do that all Hopefully we wont have to The president said the administration was not at the point taking that step He also said US officials may look at restrictions for specific areas where theres an outbreak of coronvirus or certain hot spots as they call them Trumps comments came after the US Health and Human Services Department confirmed Monday it was targeted in a cyberattack over the weekend as the agency battles the coronavirus pandemic that has killed 69 people across the US The attack prompted the National Security Council to issue a statement in a late Sunday tweet about text messages circulating about a looming national quarantine  Text message rumors of a national quarantine are FAKE There is no national lockdown CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on COVID19 the statement said President Donald Trump said Monday he believed the federal government should support airlines “very strongly” amid the losses they are taking because of the coronavirus “We’re going to back the airlines 100” Trump told a news conference “It’s not their fault” The trade group for most of the largest carriers Airlines for America requested 25 billion in grants for passenger airlines 25 billion in loan guarantees and tax relief for the first three months of the year The request Monday came after the US blocked air travel from China and most of Europe and after declines in domestic travel because of concerns about the spread of coronavirus For comparison Congress provided airlines with 5 billion in grants and 10 million in loan guarantees after the decline in travel terror attacks Sept 11 2001  Trump didn’t cite figures when he discussed his call for help for the airlines President Donald Trump issued guidelines on Monday for Americans to follow over the next 15 days to help avoid spread of the novel coronavirus but did not take drastic measures such as imposing a national quarantine or curfew The new guidelines call on Americans to avoid social gatherings involving groups of 10 or more The guidelines also call for governors in states with evidence of community transmission to close schools in affected and surrounding areas Bars restaurants food courts gyms and other venues where groups of people congregate should also be closed in states with evidence of community transmission according to the guidelines “Each and every one of us has a critical role to play” Trump said at a news conference with members of his coronavirus task force “If everyone makes these critical changes and sacrifices now we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus” he said Among the other guidelines Earlier Monday the White House pushed back on news reports that it is considering imposing curfews and a national quarantine in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus epidemic  This is not correct tweeted Katie Miller a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence who is heading up the coronavirus task force President Donald Trump said Americans could be hunkered down and practicing social distancing at least until July or August to confront the coronavirus pandemic During a White House briefing on Monday Trump was asked whether the administration had any estimate of how quickly the country would “turn this corner” Many Americans have been working from home and states are increasingly closing schools businesses and prohibiting large gatherings of people “People are talking about July August  or something like that” Trump told reporters were spaced every other seat in the White House briefing room to practice distancing The president did not discuss specific practices that would have to be implement for that long but the question was posed in terms of the steps that the country is currently taking Trump said it could take at least that long until the virus “washes through” a term he has used before that he acknowledged Monday that some around him don’t like Reporters pressed Trump on whether the work from home order and closes would be the new normal until the height of the summer “They think August could be July” Trump said “Could be longer than that” The answer to that question could have enormous implications for not for people’s daily lives but for the economy The White House and Congress are attempting to approve a first economic bill this week to help offset economic losses and are already contemplating other legislation to target particularly hard industries  John Fritze and David Jackson Several coronavirus relief packages up in the air Small businesses Cruise lines Public transit agencies Childcare for health workers Tribal clinics The list of sectors potentially needing federal help keeps growing yet efforts to deliver that aid remain bogged down Among the relief packages in play Congress earlier this month passed a 83 billion package to ramp up development of testing kits among other programs to prepare for the virus A coronavirus relief bill the House hustled to pass early Saturday morning which expands paid sick leave and covers the cost of testing for all Americans whether insured or not is on hold because at least one lawmaker objects to technical corrections needed for the bill to head to the Senate The administration already is working with Democrats on a third relief bill seeking help for cruise lines air lines and other small businesses being directly affected by the fallout from the virus The airlines are seeking 50 billion in grants loans for losses from coronavirus Democratic Senate Leader Charles Schumer DNY Monday unveiled a proposal to spend 750 billion to address a number of sectors including emergency child care for health care workers and first responders medicine and food delivery systems for seniors and assistance to keep public transportation running “We will need big bold urgent federal action to deal with this crisis” Schumer said “The kinds of targeted measures we are putting together will mainline money into the economy and directly into the hands of families that need it most Importantly this proposal will also ensure our medical professionals have all the resources – including physical space and equipment – they need to provide treatment and keep Americans safe among other peoplefocused initiatives” US airlines are asking the federal government for grants loans and tax relief to cope with the lost business from the coronavirus pandemic President Donald Trump has suspended travel from most of Europe and other countries including China which prompted airlines to greatly reduce their schedules Administration and congressional officials have suggested airlines will be among the industries targeted for aid in the next funding bill But the administration and Congress are still haggling over legislation the House approved Saturday to provide paid leave and other assistance to families coping with the outbreak The trade group Airlines for America which represents most of the largest US carriers said the industry employs 750000 people directly and 10 million indirectly But airlines have been hard hit from a dramatic decline in demand The group is urging immediate and longterm assistance including 25 billion in grants to passenger airlines 25 billion in loan guarantees and a rebate in federal excise taxes that airlines owe for the first three months of the year “This is a today problem not a tomorrow problem It requires urgent action” said Nicholas Calio the group’s CEO Confronted with a pandemic that will require the state and federal governments to work together President Donald Trump used a tweet Monday to question the governor of New York’s response Trump posted the tweet after a morning video conference with the nation’s governors to discuss the coronavirus outbreak and the government’s response to its widening impacts “Just had a very good teleconference with Nations’s Governors”   “Went very well Cuomo of New York has to ‘do more’” The president didn’t clarify what specifically he wanted New York State to do and the White House did not immediately respond to questions about the tweet State officials announced Monday that all schools would close for at least two weeks Cuomo’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment The president’s tweet followed a New York Times report that said Trump told state officials on the call to try to procure ventilators and other medical equipment themselves “Try getting it yourselves” Trump said according to a recording of the call reviewed by the Times I have to do more Cuomo tweeted in response to the presidents message minutes later No — YOU have to do something You’re supposed to be the President Two officials with knowledge of the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the contents of a conversation not released to the public said Trump wasn’t offering governors an ultimatum but rather was suggesting they try to procure the equipment at the same time that the federal government works on redirecting ventilators and other needed equipment from the strategic national stockpile Following President Donald Trumps video teleconference call with G7 world leaders the White House released a statement from the group acknowledging COVID19 as a human tragedy and a global health crisis adding they are committed to do whatever is necessary to ensure a strong global response  Trump joined leaders from Canada the United Kingdom France Germany Italy and Japan in vowing a strongly coordinated international approach in the coronavirus pandemic The group directed their health and finance ministers to continue coordinating on a weekly basis   The group also promised to  Trump earlier held a phone call with the nations governors to discuss the coronavirus response  Everybody is so well unified and working so hard It is a beautiful thing to see he   when trading was suspended for a third time in a week after the stock market plunged They love our great Country We will end up being stronger than ever before  Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow insisted Monday that the economy would weather the damage from coronavirusrelated disruptions and said plunging stock prices presented buying opportunities for investors The fundamentals of the economy are strong Kudlow told reporters after a television interview  I believe this is a short term problem He added that these big dips in the stock market including the ones last week are buying opportunities if youre a long term investor” At 120 pm EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 86 Monday  because of automatic circuit breakers that kick in when the market is falling dramatically This marked the third time in a week that circuit breakers were set off during regular trading hours following sharp losses Kudlow also said the administration would continue to push for more economic stimulus to inject money into the economy including a payroll tax cut While Trump has pushed the payroll tax holiday its not included in a stimulus bill currently pending in Congress and has met with lawmaker skepticism including among some Republicans The payroll tax holiday is a serious proposal a very serious proposal Kudlow said Kudlow also said a future stimulus should include assistance to the hardline airline industry If they get into a cash crunch were going to try to help them Kudlow said I see it as a liquidity fix not as a bailout He also said there are a lot of ideas floating around to counter the economic problems wrought the coronavirus We are going to be challenged Kudlow said Theres no question about that Responding to concerns about a global recession Kudlow also said We have a big challenge I’ve been saying that and I’ll continue to say it I’m not going to label it one thing or another” Sen Mitt Romney proposed on Monday that the federal government immediately send every adult 1000 to ease any personal financial strain caused by the coronavirus The Utah Republican said that will help families pay their bills while also boosting the economy He compared it to actions Congress took during the 2001 and 2008 recessions On Saturday the House passed legislation still pending in the Senate that would ensure sick leave for affected workers extend unemployment insurance for furloughed workers and beef up food assistance for needy families among other things White House officials and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have both said more assistance is needed White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday the White House would continue to push for more economic stimulus to inject money into the struggling economy In addition to help for airlines hotels and other travelrelated industries hit hard by the virus the administration continues to push for a payroll tax cut that was jettisoned from the bill the House just passed after bipartisan opposition emerged Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues over the weekend that lawmakers have already begun working on another emergency response package “that will continue to put families first” Romney said he will be pushing for the 1000 assistance as well as other proposals he outlined Monday to be included in the next round of help –  The White House is pushing back on news reports that it is considering imposing curfews and a national quarantine in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus epidemic  This is not correct tweeted Katie Miller a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence who is heading up the coronavirus task force appointed by President Donald Trump Miller retweeted a CNN report that there are active discussions to encourage a possible nationwide curfew in which nonessential businesses would have to close by a certain time each night Asked about rumors that the administration is considering some kind of national quarantine Miller said Consider it shot down The White House announcement follow a National Security Council tweet late Sunday about text messages floating around the Internet Said the NSC Text message rumors of a national quarantine are FAKE There is no national lockdown CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on COVID19 coronavirus   The United States will end up with as high a mortality rate from the coronavirus as Italy without an aggressive response that includes Americans following the federal government’s guidance Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on “Fox  Friends” Monday “When you look at the projections theres every chance that we could be Italy” Adams said “But theres every hope that we will be South Korea if people actually listen if people actually social distance if people do the basic public health measures that weve all been talking about as doctors all along such as washing your hands such as covering your cough and cleaning surfaces” Adams said there will be more guidance coming about the previous recommendation that people consider postponing elective surgeries to free up the system to respond to the coronavirus “And were going to be talking more today to try to figure out how we can give more guidance because elective doesn’t mean nonurgent” he said of his recent conversations with the American College of Surgeons and the American Hospital Association Adams noted that his wife just through cancer treatment which is not something that can be delayed for six months But procedures like hip and knee replacements need to be put off “until we can get a handle on this” and “we aren’t taking up ICU beds and hospital beds and then saying were going to have to put our coronavirus patients out in tents in the streets” Adams said people will start to see new testing sites in their communities including in his hometown of Cumberland Md where a hospital is starting drivethru testing  He said there will be “30 to 40 new pods” in up to 19 sates that will enable drivethru and walkthru tests But the testing will focus first on those most at risk including health care workers and then people over age 65 who have a fever or other symptoms “We are hopeful that if we lean into this then maybe in about six to eight weeks well get over the majority of the pain we will have flattened the curve and we can start to slowly get back to life as normal” he said   The Supreme Court announced Monday it is postponing oral arguments scheduled for later this month due to the coronavirus something it has not done in more than 100 years The court already had closed its doors to the public last Thursday until further notice out of an abundance of caution  The justices had several major cases scheduled for oral argument in March Top on the list were several that will decide if President Donald Trump can shield his tax returns and financial records from congressional committees and New York prosecutors In keeping with public health precautions recommended in response to COVID19 the Supreme Court is postponing the oral arguments currently scheduled for the March session the announcement said The court will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances The last time oral arguments were postponed was in 1918 due to the Spanish flu epidemic The court also shortened its argument calendars in August 1793 and August 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks The coronavirus relief bill the House hustled to pass early Saturday morning to confront the intensifying crisis could still be days away from reaching President Donald Trump who has already indicated he would sign it The Families First Coronavirus Response Act which expands paid sick leave and covers the cost of testing for all Americans needs a technical correction that leaders of both parties have agreed to But the bill would be brought up on what’s known as “unanimous consent” or UC meaning only one member would have to object to force a full vote by the House – problematic because the House lawmakers are back in their districts due to the recess and not due back until next week And at least one member is objecting Rep Louis Gohmert The Texas Republican was one of 40 GOP lawmakers who voted against the bill early Saturday morning It passed 36340 Reporter Laura Litvan of Bloomberg News tweeted after speaking with Gohmert that “he doesnt know if his concerns can be solved today He hasnt seen final text and doesnt appreciate the rushed process for passing the bill Saturday” An email to his office seeking comment was not immediately returned Monday afternoon If the technical corrections bill passes the House further delays could await it in the Senate Some conservative senators already have indicated they have problems with the bill as it relates to the strain paid sick leave would impose on small businesses   The White House has canceled the annual Easter Egg Roll because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic First Lady Melania Trump’s office announced in a news release Monday that the 142nd annual celebration was canceled “out of an abundance of caution” “The health and safety of all Americans must be the first priority especially right now” the first lady said “I deeply regret this cancellation but we need to make difficult decisions in the shortterm to ensure a healthy country for the longterm During this time I encourage everyone to listen to state and local officials and follow CDC guidelines in order to help protect the health and wellbeing of everyone” The annual tradition brings hundreds of children to the White House South Lawn to hunt for eggs and play games  This year’s celebration had been scheduled for April 13 The Easter Egg Roll officially dates back to 1878 and the presidency of Rutherford B Hayes but firsthand accounts suggest that informal festivities began with eggrolling parties under President Abraham Lincoln according to the White House website The Easter Egg Roll was not held from 1917 to 1920 because of World War I and was canceled again from 1943 to 1945 during World War II Food conservation and construction on the White House prevented any celebrations from 1946 to 1952 as well President Dwight Eisenhower reinstated the tradition in 1953   ​WASHINGTON – While the House voted overwhelmingly to approve coronavirus legislation early Saturday and President Donald Trump strongly endorsed it senators have voiced reservations about because of the impact on smaller businesses The Senate could approve legislation immediately with unanimous support But Sen Ron Johnson RWis said he would prefer that the Senate change the bill to improve it or approve nothing at all He suggested that workers who fall ill or are quarantined should use state unemployment benefits “Although mandating that all employers must pay for sick leave might sound good we need to consider the unintended consequences of this legislation” Johnson said “I fear that rather than offering a workable solution the House bill will exacerbate the problem by forcing small businesses to pay wages they cannot afford and ‘helping’ them go further into debt” The National Federation of Independent Business which advocates for 325000 small businesses wrote to congressional leaders Friday that coronavirus has already hurt 23 of its members and 43 expect an impact within three months But the group criticized several elements including mandating small businesses comply while exempting those with at least 500 workers Struggling small businesses could apply for a waiver from the secretary of the Labor Department but the exemption process is poorly defined according to the group Federal tax credits to reimburse businesses for paid leave might not arrive quickly enough according to the group “Businesses experiencing cash flow difficulties due to disruptions caused by COVID19 combined with new federally mandated paid family and medical leave may not stay afloat until the next quarterly payroll tax credit is claimed” said the letter from Kevin Kuhlman the group’s senior director for federal government relations “By requiring small businesses to shoulder additional burdens and costs small businesses who cannot afford to keep up will close” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who negotiated the legislation with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif said on Fox News Sunday said businesses would be able to get a cash advance from the Internal Revenue Service to avoid delays in reimbursements “We were very focused we need to get the money to people quickly” Mnuchin said “We dont want them to have to deal with big bureaucracy” The House and Mnuchin had announced that technical corrections were needed before the legislation moves to the Senate But amid reports of broader concerns from small businesses Mnuchin said he was working with the Senate to resolve them “We hope they pass this bill” Mnuchin said “If not well work with the center on whatever minor changes we need” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said the Senate would work to approve legislation swiftly “I know senators on both sides are carefully reviewing the details and are eager to act swiftly to help American workers families and small businesses navigate this challenging time” McConnell said   Members of the   are scheduled to hold a press briefing at 330 Monday afternoon as the US  from the virus rose to 69 with over 3770 cases confirmed as of Monday morning   According to President Donald Trumps daily schedule Trump is also scheduled to hold video meetings with the G7 world leaders and the nations governors on the coronavirus response  Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on Fox and Friends Monday morning the government was in discussions about giving guidance on elective surgeries amid heightened concerns about the disease which has been named COVID19  Were going to be talking more today to try to figure out how we can give more guidance because elective doesn’t mean nonurgent Adams said  Things like tonsils things like total hips and total knees we need to pull those down until we can get a handle on this and flatten the curve so that we aren’t using up our PPE personal protective equipment thats going to be necessary to respond to coronavirus cases he continued   Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended against holding gatherings of more than 50 people at a time the Senate where the average age is 63 remains in session this week to act on surveillance legislation and to take up the coronavirus legislation the House passed shortly after midnight last Friday  In a statement released Sunday evening Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was still waiting to receive the coronavirus bill from the House  We still need to receive the final version of the House’s coronavirus relief legislation McConnell said I commend Sec Mnuchin for his hard work on this I know Senators on both sides are carefully reviewing the details and are eager to act swiftly to help American workers families and small businesses navigate this challenging time The Kentucky Republican said more steps needed to be taken to help Americans small businesses and the healthcare system and medical professionals in future legislative packages to address the coronavirus  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said over the weekend technical corrections needed to be made to the House bill before the Senate could take it up Republican and Democratic leaders in the House already agreed to the corrections Mnuchin said "},

{"1683": "WASHINGTON – Nearly a week after invoking his powers under a Korean Warera law to compel   President Donald Trump’s administration has not formally ordered any of the machines USA TODAY has learned As governors warn of severe shortages of ventilators Trump has been hesitant to use his wartime powers to force companies to ramp up production   arguing that such an order amounts to a takeover of private industry But Trump said Friday he would use the act to require General Motors to make ventilators after what he described as a dispute with the company over supply and pricing Three administration officials speaking on the condition of anonymity told USA TODAY that the government is still exploring its options and has not yet placed an order under the Defense Production Act for any of the machines The Federal Emergency Management Agency continues to work within its authorities to coordinate with the private sector an agency spokesperson who declined to be identified said when asked about the lack of an order to GM Federal agencies are in the process of reviewing these delegated authorities the person said General Motors declined to answer questions about Trumps use of the DPA but said in a statement it was moving forward to build as many ventilators as we can as fast as we can  The White House declined to comment The revelation that the administration has not yet ordered ventilators under the Defense Production Act from GM comes as Trump Thursday announced a fresh request to Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar to use the act for several other companies including General Electric HillRom Holdings Medtronic ResMed Royal Philips and Vyaire Medical But the latest order provided no more detail on how the government would compel those companies to make ventilators than the order targeted at General Motors The order also did not clarify how many ventilators it is requesting Trump told reporters he signed a new order under the act to help companies overcome obstacles in the supply chain to speed up the production of ventilators He also said he spoke with GM CEO Mary Barra who reported that the company would be ready to start production very soon We anticipate issuing more orders under the Defense Production Act in the very near future the president said Administration officials have stressed that GM is still working to manufacture the ventilators and Trump has said he views the Defense Production Act more as a threat he can wield to nudge the companies along But the president and his senior aides have repeatedly talked of using the law – only to later back away  On Friday Trump told reporters that he thought Washington had an agreement with General Motors to manufacture the ventilators but said the company lowered its estimate of how many units it could produce and that price became a big object The president then said he would use his powers under the Defense Production Act to force the automaker to start work on the machines  I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to accept perform and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators Trump said This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis In fact Trump actually took a less significant step He signed a memorandum delegating available authorities under the act to Azar The health department has been working since then with FEMA and other federal agencies to figure out how to execute Trumps wishes Peter Navarro who Trump named as his point person on the Defense Production Act told Politico on Thursday that the administration was relying on voluntary updates from the company Navarro did not respond to questions about the act from USA TODAY In an oped published by USA TODAY on Thursday   on a plan to deliver 5000 more ventilators in the next 30 days and more than 100000 by the end of June    New York Gov   at a minimum to meet the peak of the outbreak in his state in a couple of weeks The president who has questioned that estimate said Wednesday the government is sitting on a nice pile of ventilators but is trying to be judicious in how it distributes its own limited supply  But Republicans and Democrats alike have pressed Trump to prioritize medical equipment for the government under the Defense Production Act as governors have been increasingly vocal with their concerns Sen Ted Cruz RTexas who entered selfquarantine last month after interacting with someone who tested positive for coronavirus urged the Trump administration in a March 20 letter to exercise these delegated powers to the fullest extent necessary Several lawmakers meanwhile praised the president for his announcement last week that he was using the law for General Motors House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif described Trumps decision Friday as an important but seriously belated step The Defense Production Act was enacted in 1950 at the start of the Korean War Though many of its more powerful functions have expired since then the act allows the government to order products from private companies and ensure that its orders are prioritized above others It also allows the government to create financial incentives to spur the production of materials needed for national security or in an emergency The Trump administration has relied on some of the less controversial provisions of the act already including a measure that makes it a criminal offense to hoard medical equipment needed to respond to the virus On Monday Health and Human Services added respirators medical gowns N95 masks and other equipment to the antihoarding list  Violators can be fined up to 10000 and face a year in jail  Trump has repeatedly cited his invocation of the Defense Production Act to underscore how seriously his administration is taking the virus which as of Thursday afternoon had killed more than 5300 Americans according to Johns Hopkins University Health officials estimate that   from the virus   But Trump has been reluctant to use the more controversial provisions of the act and has sent mixed messages about his views of the wartime authority On March 22 he likened the powers to nationalizing private businesses – even though the law does not give him the power to do that  Call a person over in Venezuela ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out Not too well Trump said during a White House press conference The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept  Left unsaid is that the Trump administration like others before it have regularly invoked the law under less trying conditions Trump signed an order in September for instance relying on the act for rare earth metals used by the Department of Defense   Trump chastised GM Friday asserting that the company failed to meet its agreements to manufacture ventilators while increasing the proposed price General Motors which volunteered to make the units responded with a statement asserting that the company and its vendors were working around the clock for weeks to meet this urgent need   Days later Trump went back to praising GM He said Sunday it was doing a “fantastic job” and that I dont think we have to worry about General Motors now It isnt the first time Trump or members of his administration have sent conflicting signals on whether he invoked his wartime powers During a March 20 press conference Trump at first suggested he had ordered companies to produce emergency medical equipment under the act but then said he didnt have to because they want to do the job Days later   told CNN that his agency planned to use the DPA for the first time” to obtain about 60000 test kits to help health care workers confront a widespread shortage of medical supplies amid the unfolding crisis  Later the evening the agency said in a statement that it was able to procure the test kits from the private market without using the DPA"},

bringing it with him when he left his home Now I think about if Im going to go to the grocery store I wonder if I should carry this on me And no one should be thinking about that said Lieu who represents a Los Angelesarea district  Especially when were dealing with a health pandemic we should all be working together trying to figure out whats the best way to solve this crisis and keep it from spreading Amid a rise in antiAsian American sentiment many Asian Americans have reported an   Lawmakers are no exception and several have raised their concerns over the current climate surrounding coronavirus Gregg Orton the National Director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans a coalition of over 35 national Asian American advocacy organizations said there was “no question” the number of discriminatory incidents and attacks against Asian Americans had increased since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak “Over the last month there has been a steady increase in incidents and as COVID19 conditions intensify we are concerned that these kinds of antiAsian attacks will only continue to go up” he said He noted the number of incidents was likely to be even higher “since victims may be reluctant to come forward” In recent press conferences and on Twitter President Donald Trump top administration officials and his allies have repeatedly called the coronavirus “Chinese virus” despite fierce criticism from Asian American advocates and public health advocates amid broader concerns about an increase in antiAsian American sentiment and attacks Its not racist at all no Trump told reporters at a coronavirus task force news conference last week when asked about his name for the virus It comes from China I want to be accurate Trump told reporters then he was not concerned about Chinese Americans concerns about racism either But in a Twitter post Monday Trump said it was very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States  They are working closely with us to get rid of it he said  He also declined to call coronavirus the Chinese virus in Mondays coronavirus task force briefing calling it the virus instead and echoing the message from the tweet saying The spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form It seems like there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country Trump said when asked why he commented on Asian Americans Rep Grace Meng DNY told USA TODAY Trumps response was not at all sufficient coming from someone who played a large role in setting the fire and now wants people to praise him for trying to extinguish it  Meng told USA TODAY the current atmosphere was one of the first times she felt the hostility very personally being made to feel like an outsider  This is part of the “foreignness” Asian Americans experience explained Grace Kao chair of the Yale University Department of Sociology Kao a scholar of race ethnicity and immigration noted that Italy had large numbers of coronavirus cases but there isnt a fear of Italian Americans on the street The association with being foreign and being part of ones country of origin no matter how many generations its been its unique for Asian Americans she explained As a Chinese American myself Im a little bit scared to go outside she noted You dont know what people are going to say or do  Both the Chinese and American governments have traded blame for the origins of the virus though most researchers believe the virus originated in China The Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai disavowed the claim that the virus had originated in a US military laboratory in a recent   with Axios calling the claim “crazy” Tensions flared on Capitol Hill Tuesday as Rep Jim Banks RInd introduced a resolution in the House that would condemn the Chinese government for claiming the virus came from the US and argued the Chinese governments initial response made the pandemic worse  Rep Judy Chu DCalif the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus said she called Banks afterward and told him in very clear terms that introducing this resolution now as antiAsian coronavirus hate crimes are on the rise would be extremely hurtful to the Asian American and Pacific Islander AAPI community  Banks in response told USA TODAY in a statement no one should make the mistake of believing that members of the Asian American community or Chinese citizens are responsible for or associated with the Chinese governments lies Anyone not able to make that distinction would be guilty of discrimination The potential danger is not just limited to Chinese Americans noted Rep Mark Takano DCalif who is of Japanese descent  “In America often is the case that how you look youre just Asians It doesnt matter what kind of Asian you are youre just going to feel the effects of a tense moment” he said recounting how Vincent Chin a Chinese American was beaten to death by two laidoff auto workers in Detroit in 1982 The workers had mistaken Chin for a Japanese American and had blamed him for the loss of their jobs Takano also the first openly gay person of color elected to Congress told USA TODAY he was reminded of the early name given to AIDS – GRID or GayRelated Immune Deficiency Takano recalled facing and hearing about antigay sentiment related to the term in the 1980s and “this kind of stigmatization leads to all sorts of dehumanization and humiliation” Takano said Sen Tammy Duckworth DIll who is of Chinese Thai descent said the current environment was “like the good and the bad of being Asian American” Duckworth an Army veteran who lost both legs after her helicopter was shot down in the Iraq War told USA TODAY the situation made her think of how “my whole life you know its almost like youre always an ‘other’ and youre on the frontlines fighting for the nation and protecting and defending the nation and the Constitution” She called Trump’s continued use of “Chinese” virus frustrating and not helpful at a time when we as a nation should be uniting and finding strength in one another and helping one another  The result of the rhetoric against China and Asians Duckworth said was that “I feel like right now you know its almost like its OK to be racist against Asians” Those concerns and others are why Lieu said Trump has a responsibility to ensure that all Americans feel safe and protected And its completely irresponsible for him to use unnecessary language that then puts a target on the backs of Asian Americans"},

{"1384": "WASHINGTON – A bipartisan group of lawmakers announced Thursday they plan to introduce a bill that would create a compensation fund for essential workers and their family members who have been struck by the coronavirus  Reps Carolyn Maloney DNY Jerry Nadler DNY Rep Peter King RNY and Sen Tammy Duckworth DIll introduced the Pandemic Heroes Compensation Act during a digital news conference They were joined by union representatives from the Uniformed Fire Officers Association Uniformed Firefighters Association National Rural Letter Carriers Association and SMART the International Association of Sheet Metal Air Rail and Transportation Workers  Right now workers all over this country are putting their lives on the line to help their sick neighbors keep people fed and keep our essential services running Just as they are here for us we need to be there for them if they get sick Nadler said  America will be forever indebted to the first responders and essential workers who put their lives on the line throughout this pandemic said King It is morally essential that Congress pass the Pandemic Heroes Compensation Act for these heroes and their families The legislation would create a fund modeled on the   to assist people whose jobs require them to continue to go to work during the pandemic and who become infected as a consequence Workers across all industries deemed essential by the government who became ill or died from the virus will be eligible as will any infected family members who become infected by living with a worker who was determined essential The funds could be used to help cover medical costs loss of employment or business and funeral costs  Maloney said health care costs would be covered for workers who had exhausted all other medical insurance options She said a special master from the Justice Department would be appointed to run it and create an application process She said it had yet to be determined how much money would be appropriated for the fund if the bill passed  While we have to do much more to protect these men and women as they take on greater risks during this pandemic we also need to recognize the sad reality that our nation has a responsibility to take care of the loved ones of those essential workers who perish as a result of their decision to go back to work to help others Duckworth said  Last year Maloney introduced legislation that was   in July to reauthorize the 911 Victims Compensation Fund through 2029 The fund was created after 911 to assist anyone hurt or killed in the terror attacks which included those who were exposed to hazardous materials while assisting with the cleanup  On September 11th it was the firefighters and officers who ran into the burning buildings to save lives Today it is hospital workers – nurses doctors EMS janitorial staff pharmacists technicians and all essential workers We owe them more than applause at 7 pm Maloney said Thursday  The original 911 VCF operated from 20012004 and was reactivated in January 2011 under a bill signed into law by President Barack Obama who four years later signed a bill reauthorizing it for five years But the fund began to run out of money which led to an emotional campaign to refinance it  House Democrats this week   the latest and largest legislative effort to combat the economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak which has killed more than 84000 Americans The more than 3 trillion rescue bill would include nearly 1 trillion to assist state and local governments a second round of direct 1200 payments to individuals – this time with a household limit of 6000 – and a 200 billion heroes fund that would give hazard pay to essential employees such as first responders and frontline health workers The latter provision would be separate from the Pandemic Heroes Compensation Act introduced Thursday  Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy have called for a pause on approving additional money after already passing   in coronavirus rescue packages House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif called the Heroes Act a liberal wish list” and waste of taxpayer time that has no chance of becoming law  Nadler said that the Compensation Act might stand a better chance of passing because it was separate from that package  Hopefully we can avoid the Republican opposition to this bill that would accrue to it if it were part of the Heroes Act Nadler said  Nadler said he expected it would be easier to get passed than the 911 compensation fund because in that case it took years to establish a link between peoples illnesses and their work at ground zero and some people perceived it as a New York problem  I dont think anybody is going to deny that people all over the country who are doing what they have to do – who are serving who are going into the nursing homes and the hospitals who are being the police officers and the firefighters undertaking risks – no one is going to deny that theyre taking risks for us all the time and no one is going to deny that this is a national problem Nadler said  Maloney said she expected overwhelming support because lawmakers from around the country represent essential workers who have become infected by the virus  The men and women on the front lines are putting themselves and their families lives at risk for the safety of others While these essential employees put themselves in harm’s way it is only right that they are supported the way we all were after Sept 11 2001 said Jake Lemonda president of the FDNYUniformed Fire Officers Association    Once again this is not a New York issue – it’s a global pandemic which has placed our lives in the crosshairs "},

{"1516": "President Donald Trumps soninlaw and senior adviser Jared Kushner said Dr Anthony   that reopening the country too quickly could spark fresh suffering and death was among many factors the president is considering as he shapes his coronavirus policy moving forward  On Tuesday the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases warned a Senate panel of the real risk that you will trigger an outbreak if states ignore the White House coronavirus task forces guidelines for phased reopenings  There’s risk in anything but the president carries the burden of the 30 million Americans who have lost their jobs due to this historic effort to save lives Kushner told Time magazine The virus has infected more than 1379000 people and killed at least  83000 in the US since the outbreak began But the lockdowns imposed to stop the spread of the disease have had devastating economic consequences driving unemployment levels not seen since the Great Depression  Kushner said Fauci was incredibly knowledgeable but his expertise was just one voice in a chorus of advice Trump was listening to on how to best manage the crisis  You have a lot of policymakers like the president or the governors who were elected by the people in their states and in their country to take the input of the experts and professionals and then make decisions weighing a lot of different factors Kushner said Trump has turned to Kushner for help on a number of top policy issues including the opioid crisis Middle East peace efforts construction of a wall on the USMexico border and criminal justice reform Vice President Mike Pence is the head of the coronavirus task force but Kushner has played an influential role in guiding the administrations response   At an April 2 news briefing Pence said Kushner was working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to keep supply chains open during the outbreak Kushner defined his role somewhat more broadly saying Trump tasked him with making sure the administration had the best data and making sure that we had the right people focused on all the things that needed to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual times for the American people  Kushner said the wider availability of medical supplies and personal protective equipment would help the country handle its reopening along with a public more accustomed to regular handwashing social distancing and maskwearing He also said a ton of testing for the virus would need to be done as the country resumes activities  We see testing as one of the keys to unlock the opening but it’s not the only key Kushner told Time  On Monday Trump declared we have prevailed when it came to expanding testing for the virus – though experts say the US still has a long way to go Trump clarified that he did not mean to say anyone had prevailed over the virus which is projected to kill nearly 150000 people You never prevail when you have  the kind of death you’re talking about Trump said But critics said the comment reflected a callousness toward the tragic death toll a charge also leveled at Kushner after he called the administrations response a   on April 29  I don’t want those comments to be taken in a way other than to contextualize how much our hearts break for the people who have passed and their families Kushner told Time when asked about that criticism We know that it’s a terrible tragedy and one life lost as the president said is too many he said But faced with the magnitude of what this pandemic was and what it could have been  the situation could have been a lot worse So we really worked very very hard to create a better outcome than could have been otherwise  Kushner will once again also play an important role in his fatherinlaws presidential campaign He said the reelection campaign had been geared to tout the economic successes of Trumps first four years but would have to shift focus because of the damage caused by the pandemic Kushner dismissed polls that show former Vice President Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic nominee leading the race as inaccurate and said the election will now be about who voters trust to rebuild the economy He added that Trump was looking forward to debating Biden  When asked if a second wave of the virus in the fall could cause the Nov 3 election date to be moved back Kushner told Time that was too far in the future to tell  Its not my decision to make so I’m not sure I can commit one way or the other But right now that’s the plan Kushner said Hopefully by the time we get to September October November we’ve done enough work with testing and with all the different things we’re trying to do to prevent a future outbreak of the magnitude that would make us shut down again Kushners answer that he could not commit one way or the other on the election date drew sharp criticism  I can’t believe I have to write this sentence but the presidents soninlaw doesnt get to decide when the election is said 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton  Kushner’s statement reveals amazing ignorance of the Constitution and law tweeted conservative commentator Bill Kristol It reveals startling arrogance in taking for granted he gets to have some say about when the election is held It also reveals an utter lack of understanding of his very subordinate role in our democracy  The backlash prompted Kushner to issue a clarification later Tuesday  I have not been involved in nor am I aware of any discussions about trying to change the date of the presidential

Farmington dipped below 500 last week Sheriff Kelly Sparks said compared with daily averages last spring ranging from 600 to 700 Police departments that feed arrestees to the county jails are participating in the effort to limit those populations which are at high risk of spreading infection if any inmates contract COVID19 “The public should understand that if we get COVID19 in the jail we’ve got a serious issue” Marigoni said “We don’t have the option of social distancing” Vermonters need to prepare for what could be a bleak time over the next several weeks as the state continues its efforts to control the outbreak of COVID19 but there are glimmers of hope Gov Phil Scott said Monday Scott reiterated that Vermonters need to stay home and stay isolated from others as the most effective tool to stop the spread of the virus “This is a onceinacentury challenge but with each of us sacrificing for the greater good with neighbors helping neighbors and using Vermont common sense and ingenuity and by uniting around the common cause of protecting one another we will beat this” Twentytwo Vermonters have died from COVID19 and projections for the number of people expected to die

warning of possible scams related to the coronavirus epidemic and are particularly worried about the 1200 checks that many Americans will receive from the federal government in the coming weeks and months The warning comes from the Internal Revenue Service as well as a new state task force that’s been set up specifically to battle epidemicrelated fraud It’s made up of US attorneys for the state as well as the FBI and the Virginia State Police They issued a warning late last week US Attorney G Zachary Terwilliger said in a statement that Virginians are “likely to see an uptick” in things such as advancedfee schemes that promise government relief checks Scammers may ask people to sign over their checks or get them to “verify” filing information in order to steal money Gov Jay Inslee said

and confirmed cases of the coronavirus are spiking in the city’s black community leading public health and civic leaders to sound the alarm that decades of social political and economic disadvantages

WisconsinMadison who studies the sociology of public health “But it’s precisely given the situation in Wisconsin what I would expect to see … All else is not equal especially in a city like Milwaukee”

{"4248": "WASHINGTON – Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin outlined a variety of potential proposals to Senate Republicans Tuesday as part of a legislative package to help Americans and industries that are reeling from the coronavirus The administration proposed an initial 250 billion could be sent to Americans as early as the end of April if it can muster congressional approval according to senators in attendance at the lunch meeting  Sen John Thune the Republican majority whip noted that getting cash assistance to Americans is something that has historically taken some time but “I think there are ways now electronically that you can process things more quickly” The South Dakota Republican said while an exact date remains up in the air cash assistance could potentially start to go out in late April “I think thatd be a good start date” The proposal has fairly widespread support from Senate Republicans who say it will offer immediate assistance to Americans impacted by the virus Some lawmakers have varying ideas about how the proposal should work including who should receive the payments and how much each American should get  The idea was originally raised by Sen Mitt Romney RUtah who proposed sending 1000 to each US adult Earlier Tuesday Mnuchin noted the administration was eyeing the idea Were looking at sending checks to Americans immediately he said  Several technicians at Chicago’s Midway airport air traffic control tower have tested positive for coronavirus which prompted the union to ask the Federal Aviation Administration to close the facility until it can be disinfected The National Air Traffic Controllers Association asked to review the cleaning products and materials to ensure the efficacy of the cleaning The union also asked FAA to coordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test all workers at the Midway tower for the virus “We are encouraged that the FAA is pursuing the rapid testing of all personnel at MDW Tower” the union said in a statement Midway is the 31st largest airport in the country with about 11 million passengers in 2017 according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics For comparison across town O’Hare International Airport is the thirdbusiest airport in the country with nearly 39 million passengers The hotel industry is   for owners employees and suppliers saying devastated room bookings due to the coronavirus are resulting in closures and mass layoffs Hotel executives said they detailed the devastation that the travel pullback is having on their industry in a meeting Tuesday with the Trump administration The industry is hoping for 150 billion to allow hotel owners to continue to make their loan payments and to support employees who are being laid off Another 100 billion would go to suppliers from recreation providers to retailers The contraction in travel due to the coronavirus already has had a more severe impact on the hotel industry than 911 and the 2008 recession combined said Chip Rogers CEO of the American Hotel  Lodging Association in a call with reporters Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday the Pentagon will supply civilian officials with 2000 ventilators 5 million respirator masks and 14 military laboratories to test for coronavirus Coming out of a closeddoor meeting with Republican senators Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters the proposal on the table would put a trillion dollars into the economy to help combat the impacts of coronavirus That is on top of the 300 billion from the IRS deferrals Now let me say this is a combination of loans this is a combination of direct checks to individuals this is a combination of creating liquidity for small businesses So we look forward to working with the Senate he said  Speaking to reporters at a press conference Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said they would vote on the House bill as soon as the Senate can get permission to vote  Were going to go on and vote as soon as the Senate can get permission to vote on the bill that came over from the House and send it to the president for signature he said  Addressing concerns of some Republican senators who had wanted the bill amended before they could pass it he said My counsel is to gag and vote for it anyway and address issues in later legislation  Republican senators seemed willing to work to get the package done as soon as possible  Were not going to leave this building until we get the job done Sen Mitt Romney RUtah told reporters Secretary of State Mike Pompeo used the term “Wuhan virus” five times in the span of a 16minute news conference Tuesday as he spoke with reporters about the State Department’s response to the coronavirus pandemic Pompeo’s use of the term has become a growing source of controversy as public health experts and some Democratic lawmakers warn it will stigmatize people of Asian descent and is counterproductive during a worldwide public health crisis But Pompeo has refused to back down and on Tuesday he blasted the Chinese government for what he called a “disinformation campaign” about the origin of the disease outbreak He was likely referring to suggestions by some Chinese officials that the US military may have had a role in bringing the virus to China “We know that the first government to be aware of the Wuhan virus was the Chinese government that imposes a special responsibility to raise the flag to say ‘We have a problem this is different and unique and presents risk’” Pompeo said “And it took an awful long time for the world to become aware of this risk that was sitting there residing inside of China” AsianAmerican members of Congress have called on Americans not to promote xenophobia and rumors while combating the coronavirus outbreak Lawmakers health experts and community advocates   to emphasize that the virus which has been named COVID19 was spread by exposure to infected individuals not ethnicity  Mitch Wolfe chief medical officer at the CDC told reporters stigma is the enemy of public health  Ethnicity is not a risk factor Wolfe added  President Donald Trump downplayed reports Tuesday saying hes struck a more urgent tone as the White House seeks to get a handle on the coronavirus pandemic arguing his recent remarks represented the “next logical step” in that response Trump who initially talked down the potential impact of the virus – at one point calling concern about the virus a hoax – has taken a strikingly different approach in recent days On Monday he suggested the nation “could be” heading toward a recession because of the virus as he outlined far more stringent social distancing guidelines for the nation The president’s remarks on Monday came during a massive market slide and a new report from European researchers that predicted 22 million Americans could have been killed by the virus without the steps the US is taking Trump said neither of those factors influenced his tone earlier in the week Much of the presidents more cautious approach continued for a second day Tuesday as he briefed reporters from prepared remarks at the White House Asked about the shift Trump denied that a shift even existed  “I have seen that where people actually liked it” Trump said of reports about his tone “But I didnt feel different Ive always known this is a real – this is a pandemic  I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that a couple of the agencys employees have tested positive for COVID19 During a news conference at the State Department he said those employees are following the CDC guidance as is the rest of the agency Asked how he is feeling he said I feel great As Trump calls on Congress to go big on a stimulus to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus GOP senators are weighing options for how to get that done One option is to approve an already passed House bill that focuses on ensuring paid sick leave for workers and then begin work right away on a larger package Some Republicans are pushing the idea of melding the elements of the House package with bigger steps such as sending checks to American households For the moment many Senate Republicans are setting aside worries about the deficit impact of the coronavirus package which could reach 1 trillion or more “Well Im about as conservative fiscally as you can be” said Sen John Kennedy RLa “This would not be the first preference of anybody But then it wasnt the first preference of anybody that some of our people got sick So weve got to deal with it and this is not a time to be cheap” A day after praising the press for being very fair President Donald Trump again lashed out against the media Tuesday over coverage of his response to the coronavirus “The only thing we haven’t done well is to get good press Trump told reporters complaining in particular about coverage of his phone conference Monday with a group of governors Weve done a fantastic job but it hasnt been appreciated The statement came just a day after Trump praised the press while answering a question on whether foreign governments are spreading disinformation about the coronavirus to US audiences I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair Trump said I think people are pulling together on this I really think the media has been very fair Public health labs have reported 31878 conducted coronavirus tests while clinical labs have reported 27000 conducted tests according to Adm Brett Giroir assistant secretary of health at the Department of

population of 51 million compared with the nearly 60000 conducted tests among the US population of 3722 million Italy has tested 73000 people among a population of 605 million  Deborah Birx the White House coordinator for the coronavirus response said the US was slower on the testing rollout because it was focused on quality adding that tests used in other countries prompted inaccurate results  We were adamant about having a high quality test she told reporters Tuesday In coming months you will see other tests around the world are less effective and produce false positives She said she believes the numbers in testing will change this week pointing out that highspeed tests were only approved last Thursday and Friday Sen John Cornyn RTexas said there are discussions underway about the possibility of voting remotely but noted it would take a rules change in the Senate to make such a proposal possible something that would need a supermajority – 67 votes – for approval “The Senate is a pretty traditionbound place” he said “But these are extraordinary circumstances” President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin say they are exploring the idea of legislation that would include sending checks to Americans to help them manage through the economic impact of coronavirus disruptions Were looking at sending checks to Americans immediately Mnuchin said at a news conference Tuesday by the administrations coronavirus task force Trump added he believed lawmakers and the administration could come together for a big bold package Mnuchin has been meeting with Democrats and Republicans as the White House and Congress attempt to pass more legislation aimed at addressing the impacts of coronavirus Trump said We’re going big on the stimulus plan saying it will be a big infusion We want to go big go solid he said We don’t want airlines going out of business or people losing their jobs and not having money to live Other news from the briefing President Donald Trump

and I think we’re going to win faster than people think I hope Trump told reporters  President Donald Trump will ask Congress for a roughly 850 billion stimulus package to stem the blow to the economy from massive shutdowns related to the coronavirus according to an administration official An official said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is “asking Congress for a package today but we are not in a position to confirm the number at this time” Another official said the number is “around 850 billion” Senators later today will hear more about the next package and hope to get a precise dollar figure from Mnuchin at a Republican lunch at the US Capitol The package is expected to include 500 billion for a payroll tax holiday 50 billion for airlines and 250 billion for small business loans according to an administration analysis  Trump has been pushing the idea of a payroll tax holiday to get cash into Americans pockets He said Monday that he believes help for the beleaguered airline industry is also crucial Democrats and some Republicans are wary of the payroll tax idea saying it wont help some of the people hit hardest by the disruptions such as those who have lost their jobs or had their

in the chamber is calling for Capitol Hill to seriously consider voting remotely or at least holding committees by teleconference or video links that would allow the exchange of ideas without forcing lawmakers their aides police and other Capitol Hill staff to congregate and potentially spread the disease “We have to think anew about the way the Senate does business” he said on the Senate floor Tuesday morning “If we’re telling people to do their work from home when possible – teleconferencing as opposed to being physically present  what are we doing to achieve the same thing” Senate rules require a senator to be physically present During a roll call vote senators may vote from their desks or in the well of the chamber but they must be present so the clerk can record their vote Durbin said he wants the Senate to create a formal task force to examine this practice He said he’s already spoken to Sens Amy Klobuchar DMinn and Brian Schatz DHawaii about moving forward with the idea

{"2202": "We have too much milk may not have enough meat and could eventually run short on soup Let’s just say Americas food supply chain is getting out of whack due to the   The sudden shift from restaurant dining to athome eating coupled with panic buying at grocery stores is causing major disruption in the manufacturing distribution and sales of food products Dairy farmers are dumping excess raw milk while meat companies are scrambling to meet demand Though experts say the food supply chain has performed admirably so far – most factories are still operating and many are doing so at full blast – industry watchers are getting concerned about supplies of beef poultry and pork as the COVID19 crisis continues After Smithfield Foods on Sunday announced the indefinite closure of its pork processing plant in Sioux Falls South Dakota due to an outbreak among its employees CEO Kenneth Sullivan issued a warning about the state of the nation’s meat supply chain “The closure of this facility combined with a growing list of other protein plants that have shuttered across our industry is pushing our country perilously close to the edge in terms of our meat supply” he said in a statement “It is impossible to keep our grocery stores stocked if our plants are not running” Some food companies – such as Conagra Brands which makes Duncan Hines desserts Slim Jim jerky and Hunts ketchup – are temporarily reducing varieties to focus on items that are in high demand Discounts are also disappearing as retailers and manufacturers try to shore up supplies “Typically you run promotions or discounts if you want to see heightened demand on your products or get heightened awareness out but not right now” said Arun Sundaram a stock analyst for CFRA Research who tracks food companies In the wake of   supplies of products like soup and pasta “are still catching up” said Mike Duffy CEO of CS Wholesale Grocers a wholesale grocery supply company with more than 15000 employees He estimated that retailers have only about half of the pasta and soups they would typically carry And the demand for soup in the spring could have a ripple effect later this year Duffy said “This is the time of year where the soup manufacturers will build inventories for the fall and winter season and we’re using a lot of that inventory right now just to keep shelves stocked” he said In a twist though some other types of products are readily available Supplies of raw milk which is processed into drinkable dairy milk greatly exceed retail demand due in large part to the collapse of sitdown dining at restaurants and the closure of schools Now dairy farmers are dumping excess milk that they can’t sell to processors Duffy said the food supply chain is “responding but it’s stressed” Much of the industry’s focus right now is on ensuring the continuous supply of fresh meat particularly after Smithfield on Wednesday announced that it would temporarily close its dry sausage plant in Cudahy Wisconsin and its ham plant in Martin City Missouri Right now we’re OK” on meat supplies “but it’s something we watch frankly daily” Duffy said One of the reasons that plant shutdowns are particularly disruptive for the meat industry is they’re typically very large due to the laborintensive methods of processing meat such as picking out bones by hand With 3700 employees the Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls usually represents about 4 to 5 of US pork production or about 18 million servings per day Workers at meat processing plants are especially at risk of contracting the coronavirus because they’re often positioned close to one another experts say Several other meat processing plants around the US also have closed with many workers infected including Tyson Foods’ plant in Columbus Junction Iowa where two workers died and JBS USA’s Greeley Colorado factory which also has had two deaths “In other types of food processing facilities they tend to be more machine operators so people are not in as close proximity and not as susceptible” said Rick Williams a partner at Battle Creek Michiganbased JPG Resources a food and beverage operations consultancy Deanna Darrah of Randolph Ohio said she has tried repeatedly to find ground beef in the last month and was met with empty shelves “We’ve been eating more vegan meat” said Darrah who is a dietary cook at a nursing home “The organic stuff is not flying off the shelves in northern Ohio” In the poultry industry a sickened workforce is threatening to create an imbalance between the number of chickens on the farm and the number processed into meat for sale at the store About 2 million chickens owned by a company on the Delmarva Peninsula which includes southern Delaware the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Eastern Shore of Virginia will be killed at the farms where they were raised according to Delmarva Poultry Industry Inc But their meat will not make it to market due to an insufficient number of workers to keep up with production John Campbell has had difficulty finding chicken and eggs in Yankton South Dakota at both Walmart and HyVee “There’s just a giant empty area where chicken used to be” Campbell said “They have some chicken wings but I don’t see chicken breast or chicken thighs And eggs are hit or miss Sometimes they’ll have them and other times they are completely sold out” With milk it’s a different story The sudden closure of schools and restaurants has thrust farmers into crisis mode Milk consumed there including milk used to make cheese and butter at restaurants is suddenly going to waste Brian Rexing a dairy farmer in Indiana’s southwest corner said he was forced to dispose of nearly 30000 gallons of milk in the fields on his farm last week There was nowhere for the milk to go “When you can’t finish it and get it to market and see it in consumers’ hands that’s tough that’s our livelihood” said Rexing who owns New Generation Dairy in Owensville Indiana For more than a week Golden E Dairy farm near West Bend Wisconsin has been dumping about 25000 gallons of milk a day because processing plants full to the brim will not take it “People were saying things like ‘how could I sleep at night’ and that I should be ashamed of myself” Elbe said “Some people thought it was only happening on this farm But it’s all across the country There are a lot of farms doing this now” Yet he can’t donate milk to charities because straight from the farm it’s unpasteurized and unbottled State law for one thing would prohibit that “We can’t just pull up in front of a food pantry with a 7000gallon tank and say ‘here you go get your jugs out and we will fill them’ But some people don’t understand” Elbe said Jim Mulhern CEO of the National Milk Producers Association which represents dairy farmers and coops said farmers have been hit hard despite “strong” retail demand “It is that displacement of product that has created problems throughout the supply chain It all backs up” he said What many Americans don’t realize however is that milk dumping is not unusual as the dairy business has been in crisis mode for years with consumers drinking less milk “It’s not uncommon to have wastage and the stories of milk being poured off” JPG Resources partner Rifle Hughes said “That actually happens all time” In a way the milk industry operates like the automotive industry which relies on justintime supply of parts to assemble into finished vehicles With one big exception “While we have justintime manufacturing for a normal market we don’t have the ability to turn off that spigot when there’s a disruption” Mulhern said “You can’t just shut those cows off to stop the milk from coming So you’ve got much more supply than there is demand” To preserve the environment farms ideally pour excess milk into an anaerobic digester which generates biogas or into a manure lagoon Mulhern said But “as the volumes grow it becomes an issue” he said For many other products however supplies are still running tight Grocery stores are only meeting about half of current consumer demand for goods UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a research note April 12 Duffy the wholesale grocery executive said there’s generally sufficient food in the pipeline from factory to warehouse to retail but bare shelves will continue because it takes time for products to wind their way through to stores “It just takes a while for the system to catch up” he said “Some of these categories may take six eight 10 weeks to fully republish at the shelf” Billy Roberts a food and drink analyst with market research firm Mintel said there’s been a huge surge in sales of meats and frozen foods Stocks may be somewhat depleted but not completely depleted like we were seeing early” Roberts said “I think manufacturers are striving to keep up with a surge in demand” One concern is that concerns about shortages tend to create shortages “We could see consumers to a degree buy more simply because of concerns about will supplies actually be there” Roberts said With retail demand at unheardof levels   are operating at or near full capacity to keep up “Many companies are running their manufacturing plants seven days a week right now as opposed to five or six days a week” Sundaram said But that’s not enough in some cases to keep stores supplied especially because some plants are facing labor shortages when workers become infected or stay home out of fear “It’s a challenge for everyone right now to try to get food on the shelves” Sundaram said Meat shortages could prove to be a catalyst for more people to try out alternative meats Impossible Foods announced Thursday that it was accelerating its expansion plans due to COVID19 and increased demand On Friday the company’s plantbased Impossible Burger will debut at 777 stores including Albertsons JewelOsco Pavilions Safeway and Vons in California Nevada and parts of the Midwest “We’ve always planned on a dramatic surge in retail for 2020 – but with more and more Americans eating at home under ‘shelterinplace’ orders we’ve received requests from retailers and consumers alike” Impossible Foods’ President Dennis Woodside said in a statement During the White House coronavirus news briefing Wednesday US Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the country has “plenty of food for all of our citizens” “The bare store shelves that you may see in some cities in the country are a demand issue not a supply issue” Perdue said “The way food is prepared and packaged to be sold in a restaurant or a school is significantly different than the way its packaged for you to buy in the grocery store” Perdue said “were working through” supply chain issues that couldn’t be fixed immediately While food companies are taking steps to bolster production wherever possible industry experts said it requires time and investments for food manufacturers to reconfigure their plants to make food for retail consumption instead of restaurant use “It’s very difficult to take those products that are packaged in ways that are good for restaurants and colleges and hospitals and now put them into” retail packaging said Hughes partner at JPG Resources For example he said flour that was previously supplied in huge bags for bakeries can’t suddenly be repackaged into smaller bags for sale at retail to Americans who are suddenly baking more treats at home Or bacon that was supplied to restaurants in large boxes can’t suddenly be repurposed into small packages In an attempt to pivot   California Pizza Kitchen and Beef ‘O’ Brady’s have added groceries on the menu The trend has been fueled by the Food and Drug Administration relaxing regulations for bulkfood purchases in late March States including Nebraska and Texas have also relaxed state rules that allow eateries to sell groceries It’s unclear if it will be enough to offset the disruption caused by the closure of a massive plant like Smithfield’s operation in Sioux Falls which simply adds pressure to a supply chain that was already strained “The cumulative impact of these closures is going to stress the supply chain and create supply challenges if capacity is not brought back online in a timely manner” Duffy said Campbell a computer support technician in South Dakota said he hopes to be able to purchase chicken thighs again soon after a month of going without He says the chicken shortages have surprised him “I saw people going nuts with paper products with toilet paper and such but I don’t see people hoarding chicken” Campbell said “They had some signs at one point saying one milk per person or one toilet paper but I never saw signs about chicken Chicken just seemed to disappear” Fill out the form below or   for possible inclusion in USA

Vice President Mike Pence and the coronavirus task force have urged people to wear masks  Individuals should wear masks Conway said adding that local officials have not been doing enough to spread the

told reporters Theyre not wearing a mask because nobodys saying Put the mask on But at largescale events with the president maskwearing has not been a requirement made either by local officials or the Trump campaign At Trumps Tulsa Okla campaign rally—the first large campaign event since the start of pandemic lockdowns—the campaign said it provided free masks to attendees but would not require them to be worn which left many of the presidents supporters maskless that evening For Trumps July 3 event at Mount Rushmore South Dakota Gov Kristi Noem said masks would be provided but not required and

This week Trump said he would be open to wearing one if he were in a crowd where social distancing was not possible If I were in a tight situation with people I would absolutely he said The next day   White House officials have noted that Trump is tested routinely for the coronavirus and that masks are intended to prevent the spreading of the virus rather than protection from getting it In midJune

several states may have moved “too quickly” in their reopenings  Adm Brett Giroir assistant secretary for Health and Human Services who has overseen testing also said Thursday that the US is not flattening the curve right now The curve is still going up Trump has said that the countrys recent rise in coronavirus cases is due only to the amount of testing being done despite health officials assessments that there is really an increased spread in many areas as they have reopened At his Tulsa rally on June 20 Trump claimed that he   calling testing a doubleedged sword and arguing that more cases discovered made the US look bad  Heres the bad part When you do testing to that extent youre going to find more people youre going to find more cases Trump said So I said to my people Slow the

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said his remarks were made in frustration at the medias focus on rising cases instead of testing capacity but he wasnt aware of any order from the president to slow testing Despite indications from his staffers that the comment about slowing testing was made in jest Trump told reporters later that week I dont kid He has reiterated versions of the claim that increased testing leads to more cases many times Cases up only because of our big number testing Mortality rate way down Trump tweeted on June 23 But Giroir told members of Congress on

1100 deaths by early August from COVID19 Less than two weeks ago state health officials predicted fewer than 700 deaths by early August according to the Department of Health and Environmental Control

making money and people to get out of their homes During his introductory remarks Tuesday at his Accelerate SC committee he said he’s balancing those wishes with a need to stop the virus from spreading rapidly again “I get letters from ladies that are dying to go to the beauty parlor Of course we don’t want them to die when they go to the beauty parlor” McMaster said Gov Kristi Noem said

Conservative justices who control the state Supreme Court raised doubts Tuesday about whether Democratic Gov Tony Evers’ stayathome order is legal asserting that the Legislature never intended to give the executive branch so much power Justice Rebecca Bradley suggested during oral arguments about the order that state Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm’s decision to extend the mandate without legislative input amounts to tyranny She also questioned whether Palm might next herd people into social distancing camps akin to World War II Japanese internment camps “There is a constitutional problem with the Legislature giving away this much power to an unelected Cabinet secretary” Bradley said “The people never consented to a single individual having that much power” Plans

{"2257": "SAN FRANCISCO – Doctors and scientists are working furiously to find effective treatments   but are   or hoard mentioned drugs not yet proven to work Despite widespread rumors social media reports and  surrounding the effectiveness of several existing drugs so far there are  for COVID19 according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “There’s no magic drug out there right now” Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said at a news conference Thursday  When COVID19 treatments do arrive they will likely fall into two categories experts say The first will be aimed at slowing down replication of the virus in patients early in the disease The second will help stop the deadly autoinflammatory response in the lungs in its critical stage include the malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir and azithromycin a bacterial antibiotic They remain however classed as “investigational therapeutics” because there isn’t enough data to show they are a safe and effective treatment for the illness “We often see antiviral therapies that are promising in the test tube and animal models But before we give it to patients with confidence we really need to see the data in humans” said Jeffrey Klausner a professor of medicine and public health at the University of CaliforniaLos Angeles          Anecdotal evidence may show when people are given a certain drug their condition improves or stabilizes but other factors could be at play A person may have gotten better on their own made it to the hospital more quickly or had fewer underlying risk factors affecting the course of the illness  “Many drugs have been thrown out as being possibly helpful But right now we don’t have a good control of who’s getting it and at what stage said Rodney Ho a professor of pharmaceutics at the University of Washington in Seattle who researches viral diseases and treatments We don’t have a complete picture yet” Labs and companies worldwide are busy screening likely drug candidates to see if they bind to proteins on the surface of the SARSCoV2 virus that causes COVID19 The problem is a screen tells you only whether the proteins bind not the effects said Kevan Shokat a professor of cellular and molecular pharmacy at the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco Proteins can block or activate responses in a cell so a drug could stop a function the cell uses to protects itself making the patient worse It could “actually help the virus” he said “There could be drugs that have no benefit drugs that have a benefit and drugs that do harm” Shokat said No one should expect immediate clarity said Marc Jenkins who directs the center for immunology at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis “Every possible strategy will be tried he said I suspect that’s going to be confusing for a while because there will be so many things being tried Patients with COVID19 go through a series of stages in their illness Exact percentages are impossible to know yet but general patterns are emerging For some of those infected there are few to no symptoms By far the largest group visible to medical professionals now are those who present with fever headaches and cough and in some cases shortness of breath Most will get better on their own Currently it appears about 15 of those infected go on to have severe illness and need to be hospitalized Another 5 become so ill that they must be treated in an intensive care unit Antiviral drugs would be used early on in the infection to slow or stop the virus from reproducing in the patient’s body allowing the immune system to respond shortening illness duration and halting progression to more severe forms of the disease   Such treatments would be similar to antiviral medications given at the onset of the seasonal flu such as Tamiflu Available only by prescription these drugs taken within two days of becoming sick can lessen fever and flu symptoms and shorten the length of illness by about a day While numerous possible antivirals that might work against the virus have been in the news none have been tested to ensure they work against the disease or are safe These include remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine a combination of two HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir and a triple combination of lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferonbeta Favilavir is being tested in China  Antivirals are often given in combinations to help decrease the chance the virus can survive and mutate into an untreatable form but they take longer to test “Combinations take a long time you have check the safety of each drug at different doses in combination with other drugs in different doses” Shokat said COVID19 patients with severe illness   or ARDS This extremely serious syndrome isn’t caused by the virus but by the body’s response to it The inflammatory response can include the release of chemicals that can trigger fever and low blood pressure It can also cause small blood vessels in the lung to leak fluid and fill up the alveoli the tiny air sacs in the lung that process oxygen and bring it into the bloodstream “The vast majority of patients who die from COVID19 are dying from ARDS” said Michael Matthay a professor of medicine and expert on the syndrome As the COVID19 pandemic grows researchers are focusing drugs including monoclonal antibodies that bind to molecules that cause or worsen the cascade of symptoms Some of the drugs being investigated include Actemra tocilizumab and Kevzara sarilumab – both used to treat rheumatoid arthritis – and the experimental drug gimsilumabOthers are being investigated  In the meantime experts urge people to remain calm and not experiment themselves with unproven drugs that could have side effects worse than the disease itself “Every drug has toxicity it could make you worse or it could make you better Shokat said That’s why drugs take a long time to develop – because we have to make sure  "},

{"1463": "WASHINGTON – After Secretary of State  concluded a virtual summit on Wednesday with top diplomats from six other countries he struck a note of solidarity with US allies as the world faces down a common enemy the coronavirus pandemic   I made it clear to our G7 partners – especially to our friends in Italy and the rest of Europe – that the United States remains committed to assisting them in all ways possible  at the State Department after his private video conference with foreign ministers from Canada France Germany Italy Japan and the United Kingdom  But the Trump administration has not championed an international response to the global disease threat – nor have other world leaders experts say It’s been very chaotic” said Yanzhong Huang a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and director of global health studies at Seton Hall Universitys School of Diplomacy and International Relations Indeed after the G7 meeting ended a  that the seven foreign ministers could not agree on a joint statement because Pompeo insisted on using Wuhan virus to describe the pandemic a move seen as deliberately provocative toward China Pompeo essentially confirmed that report Thursday  “Different countries take different approaches Pompeo told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Thursday when asked about that report My theory is we should always be accurate with respect to how we identify something  This virus began in Wuhan I’ve referred to it as the Wuhan virus” During other international crises – such as the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and the global economic meltdown in 2008 – world leaders joined forces to confront the threat of disease and economic collapse But the reaction to COVID19 has been very statecentric Huang said with most afflicted countries turning inward  Across the globe individual governments are competing to secure scarce medical supplies from a strained global supply chain closing borders with little to no notice to their neighbors and lobbing verbal broadsides that threaten to deepen the discord  The world today that’s impacted by this is terribly fractured terribly fragmented said Stephen Morrison director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Affairs a Washington think tank We don’t see much on the horizon in terms of promising diplomatic initiatives to bring the major powers and others together to address both the pandemic virus crisis as well as the economic dislocations that it’s brought forward One reason The coronavirus is unprecedented in the force and speed with which it has spread from one country to the next First reported by Chinese officials in late December it has now infected at least 415000 people across more than 150 countries according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker   Typically on an international level the World Health Organization goes into full throttle in response to disease outbreaks as does the United Nations said Rep Michael McCaul the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee But the world was caught off guard by coronavirus he said And once it began hitting the United States it’s been a little bit of a catchup game Morrison and others say the virus struck also at a particularly problematic time when international institutions have been weakened and a nationalistic fervor has swept many governments     In those countries best positioned to rally an international response several leaders greeted the outbreak with a particular level of skepticism and were somewhat dismissive of the notion that there needed to be highlevel coordinated action Morrison said Certainly that was true in Washington in London in Rome and elsewhere In Washington the Trump administration has among other steps shut down   without consultation   for its handling of the epidemic tried to buy up scarce medical equipment from US allies that are themselves under siege with coronavirus cases and   of a virus coverup China was very secretive okay President Donald Trump said during a March 21 briefing on the US coronavirus response Very very secretive And thats unfortunate  There were also reports that the Trump administration of money to a Germany company working to develop a coronavirus vaccine sparking fears the US was trying gain exclusive rights to inoculate Americans first Both the German firm and the White House   but it highlighted the sense that this was an everymanforhimself battle and demonstrated that traditional allies were eyeing each other with new suspicions Heather Conley director of the Europe program at CSIS said its not only the US that has responded to the pandemic with a unilateralist bent There is just an absolute scarcity of coordination and collaboration in Europe she said This is going to be a soulsearching moment for the European Union because it’s created the potential for solidarity coordination and collaboration across the EU Conley said Instead what we’ve seen is that this pandemic has completely laid bare that  those institutions are not going to be used for this great challenge Pompeo has echoed Trump in criticizing China At Wednesdays news conference the secretary of state pivoted from touting Americas global generosity to attacking China for what he has labeled a coverup of the initial outbreak “The Chinese Communist Party poses a substantial threat to our health and way of life as the Wuhan virus outbreak clearly has demonstrated Pompeo said refusing to use the official medical name – COVID19 – despite objections from Chinese officials and public health experts who say it could lead to stigmatization and attacks on Asians  Pompeo noted that China was the first to resist international help Officials suppressed reports about the outbreak and sought to punish doctors who raised alarms Xi Jinping’s government refused to allow US medical experts to go to Wuhan the initial epicenter and brushed off the Trump administration’s offer of financial assistance We tried  from the opening days to get our scientists our experts on the ground there so that we could begin to assist in the global response to what began there in China but we weren’t able to do that Pompeo said Wednesday  Chinese officials have since been more transparent sharing the virus genome sequence and other vital data And some experts fear that picking a fight with China now is counterproductive particularly because the country dominates the global supply chain for indemand medical products  We should be cooperating with China This is not a good time for us or for China to say Let’s have a spitting match said Gayle Smith who served on the National Security Council and other top positions in the Obama administration “The fact that we’re interconnected and dependent it isn’t a political position It’s a statement of fact  Smith worked at the White House when President Barack Obama grappled with the Ebola outbreak and she said he badgered other world leaders to cobble together a campaign against the disease He called pretty much every leader on the planet to say ‘Here’s what we’re doing we’ve got this many doctors this much money Smith recalled Then he would say What are you going to do How much money can you put in How many health care workers He really pressed everybody  As the coronavirus continues its steady march Smith noted scientists epidemiologists and other experts are sharing their research and other information about the virus across borders  But she added at the level of global political leadership there’s a real stark absence of the kind of international collaboration thats needed Even if the scientists keep cooperating as they race to develop a vaccine Huang said he doesn’t foresee that happening on the political front   He fears if and when a vaccine becomes available those countries that have the capacity to manufacture it “will first satisfy the needs of their people and those countries that do not have the capacity will have to wait This will probably cause more death and more suffering”"},
{"1536": "WASHINGTON – Days after Washington Gov Jay Inslee tweeted criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak his chief of staff got a call from an aide to   asking if Inslee could meet with the vice president When  ’s office agreed Pence would fly to his state the next day the aide had to run because Pence was talking to reporters and wanted to announce the trip in the next 30 seconds  The eagerness of Pence a former Indiana governor to reach out to states chief executives – including those who have gotten crosswise with the administration – was likewise apparent in a comment he made to Inslee “We’re governors and we understand this” David Postman Inslee’s chief of staff remembers Pence saying The vice presidents natural kinship with governors has helped him pull off the rare feat of pleasing both his boss and those his boss has attacked “He gets along with people I think much better than I do” President Donald Trump said last week “Mike can put up with things that – sometimes I say It’s amazing that he can put up with it’ ” Pence hasn’t always been able to deliver everything requested by governors who have been frustrated by aspects of the federal government’s response to the biggest crisis most of them will ever face But Pence generally gets high marks for serving as a liaison It’s a role he’s embraced through regular conversations with governors in which he offers help navigating the bureaucracy and fields requests for more resources Pence eases the tensions when they flare up “He’s been really helpful and engaged” said Michigan Gov   one of the Democrats besides Inslee whom the president has criticized and said Pence shouldn’t deal with There are still plenty of frustrations with the federal government’s response Governors have complained of testing and equipment shortages They’ve pushed for stronger implementation of a wartime powers act to increase production of ventilators testing supplies and personal protective equipment And they’ve repeatedly urged a more cohesive national strategy including a centralized process of distributing the lifesaving supplies so states dont bid against each other and the federal government “There’s a kind of lack of coordination” Maryland Gov Larry Hogan a Republican who heads the National Governors Association and who has not been shy about speaking out told USA TODAY “We’re improving the process but that certainly is an issue” Colorado Gov Jared Polis a Democrat appealed directly to Pence for help describing in   the state’s “crisislevel shortage” of equipment to protect health care workers and first responders Asked about the governor’s interactions with Pence spokesman Conor Cahill said Polis appreciates the vice president’s “responsiveness and accessibility” but “remains concerned about the clarity and transparency around the timing and qualities of the lifesaving supplies” “A few weeks ago the guidance seemed to be that states should get these materials themselves which Colorado is actively pursuing” Cahill said in an email last week “And now the guidance seems to be shifting but no one is certain” In fact the next day Trump   that he was sending 100 ventilators to the state not because of Polis – who had complained that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had blocked a shipment of ventilators – but at the request of Cory Gardner the state’s Republican senator who faces a difficult reelection “President Donald Trump is treating lifesaving medical equipment as emoluments he can dole out as favors to loyalists” the Denver Post wrote in an   Illinois Gov J B Pritzker a Democrat said it’s not clear that Pence “has the authority ultimately to deliver on the things that are being promised by the White House” “We would like it if more of the promises that have been made at the federal level had been delivered upon” Pritzker told USA TODAY “I’m glad to have a friendly voice on the other end of the call in the vice president and I do think that he is listening to the governors even if sometimes he isn’t able to fulfill our requests” Polls show much of the public agrees with many governors that the federal government should do more More than half the respondents to a   said Washington isn’t doing enough to help states “Most Americans disagree with the Trump administration’s position that the federal government is a backup to the states” pollster Patrick Murray said Pence has repeated a mantra that the administrations approach is locally executed state managed and federally supported And he’s leaned into the support role “He’s the one that organized and convinced everybody to have the governors so involved in the debate and the discussion” Hogan said “He has risen to the occasion … I think hes done a really incredible job” A USA TODAYIpsos Poll found the public is more likely to have extremely positive or negative views of Trump’s performance and more moderate opinions of Pences   There is a notable difference among Democrats Nearly one in four say they have a “great deal” or “fair amount of trust” in Pence to provide accurate information about coronavirus compared with 14 who say that about Trump Seventythree percent of Democrats surveyed April 910 say they have “not very much” or no trust in Pence and 84 say that about Trump When Trump  of the administration’s Coronavirus Task Force in late February the vice president noted that he was Indiana’s governor in 2014 when the first Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS case in the USA emerged – in Indiana Pence said he learned from that the importance of partnerships between the different levels of governments and health authorities in responding to dangerous infectious diseases Pence did not mention   he’d dealt with as governor in 2015 the nation’s first HIV outbreak linked to the injection of oral painkillers Studies in medical journals have said the outbreak could have been prevented if the state had acted faster in allowing cleanneedle exchanges New York Gov Andrew Cuomo publicly thanked Pence for clearing hurdles with the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention so New York laboratories could do their own coronavirus testing That dramatically increased testing capacity “I had asked Vice President Pence to go back to the federal powers and say lets get FDA and CDC out of the mandatory approval business break that federal bottleneck and let the states use their own laboratories” Cuomo said in midMarch Likewise Pence helped Washington state clear regulatory hurdles so its health department could validate local labs “We were able to get our health lab director in direct contact with the person at the FDA who had heard from the vice president that this was a priority” said Postman the Inslee aide When Pence’s home state was very short on test kits last month Indiana Gov Eric Holcomb reached out to his predecessor for help After Pence connected Holcomb with the CDC director the state got a boost to tide it over until kits could be produced locally “A few moments ago I got off the phone with the vice president” Holcomb said during one of his briefings in March  “He was just checking in … I was able to share with him what our concerns were” Ohio Gov Mike DeWine another Republican said governors are used to dealing with the vice president whose outreach started well before the coranavirus  Since I became governor hes reached out on numerous occasions to me just to see if I needed anything or if he could be of help DeWine told USA TODAY During the health crisis DeWine said Pence has helped cut through red tape several times including when Ohio was arranging how to continue feeding lowincome students who were no longer able to get free meals at shuttered schools  Pence has held an unprecedented number of calls with governors according to Hogan Group calls can last more than two hours “We’re interacting with governors every day seven days a week” Pence said at a  briefing “And we welcome that” During a call with all governors Maine’s Janet Mills urged the administration not to forget about rural states Pence told her he’d organize a call just for rural states to focus on their unique challenges according to   When Pence was asked at a White House briefing last week about Kansas Gov Laura Kelly’s complaint that none of her seven requests to FEMA for supplies had been fulfilled Pence said he had not spoken with Kelly about that “But I’ll reach out this evening certainly” he said The next day Kelly a Democrat said Pence assured me he would do everything he could to meet the states most urgent PPE needs “Lack of personal protection equipment continues to be a problem she   But I will say that Vice President Pence has been a thoughtful partner throughout this pandemic and has worked with us in good faith” The vice president’s solicitousness is a stark contrast with Trump’s frequent complaints that governors should be more appreciative of what the administration is doing for them When Inslee   in March that the state and federal partnership to combat the coronavirus would be more successful “if the Trump administration stuck to the science and told the truth” Trump  who is “not a good governor” The president engaged in a   with Illinois Pritzker before accusing him of not being able to do his job and “always complaining” He’s traded insults with Cuomo and referred to  as “halfWhit” Trump said all Michigan’s governor does is “sit there and blame the federal government” so Pence shouldn’t deal with her or Inslee “I say ‘Mike don’t call the governor of Washington Youre wasting your time with him Dont call the woman in Michigan’ ”  at a White House briefing last month “You know what I say If they dont treat you right I dont call” Pence the president has said is a “straight shooter” who quietly calls anyway Whitmer told USA TODAY Pence remains responsive “When I asked for a phone call we get a phone call scheduled quickly” she said Though there was some concern in Inslee’s office after Trump complained that governors weren’t sufficiently appreciative there have been no signs of punishment according to Inslee’s top aide “That’s not nothing We know that sometimes the president doesn’t like it when people who work for him don’t follow his lead on these issues of tone and things” Postman said Pence he said appears to be trying to show he can work in a bipartisan fashion with the governors who are on the front lines of the crisis “And hes been able to balance that” Postman said “with whatever pressure he might or might not feel from his boss”"},

state  in person and absentee A lack of poll workers has resulted in many polling places closing   And heres   Nonelection related updates on COVID19 in Milwaukee  Did you request an absentee ballot for the spring election that you never received  Election clerks will not be releasing results until next week so we will not be posting results on our site today But visit   for full coverage of the election and the issues at stake The Milwaukee Election Commission reported turnout totals for inperson voting at the polls Tuesday In an election that featured widespread absentee balloting 18803 voters came to Milwaukees five polling sites on Tuesday to vote in person That number will be dwarfed by absentee balloting when the numbers are counted Heres the breakdown for inperson voting Tuesday at Milwaukee voting sites  Riverside High 3914 South Division 3577 Hamilton High 3774 Washington High 3628 Marshall High 3910 —  An hour after polls closed statewide at 8 pm there was still a long line of voters outside of Riverside University High School on Milwaukees east side waiting for their turn to vote  Many in line were standing closer than the recommended sixfoot distance Many of the people in line were wearing paper or makeshift masks  Voters expressed frustration with the circumstances of Tuesdays voting and being funneled through such a limited number of polling sites in the city Amina Merchant 39 was wearing a full plastic shield over her face with a paper mask beneath it as she left the polling place about 840 pm She said she didnt request her absentee ballot in time so she waited two hours in line Merchant said she is worried about her health and just gave birth two weeks ago I think this is terrible she said of the situation in which she cast her ballot I think its completely unhealthy I think everyones safety is at risk If you look nobody is keeping or adhering to the social distancing of six feet and so I am very worried for everyones health including my own Jesse Stingl said about 820 pm that he got in line at 759 pm He said as he stood near the end of the line in Riverside Park that he felt making a statement was worth the risk of getting sick I felt like they were attempting to suppress me by limiting the number of Milwaukee polling stations to five and forcing voters into an unsafe environment to vote he said He said he saw no semblance of control in terms of preventing the spread of infection I have to weigh whether or not I think my rights are as important as my own safety and the decision to come out here period he said —  The Milwaukee Election Commission released preliminary numbers of ballots cast at two of the five voting centers open in the city Tuesday with an hour before polls were set to close  Those numbers are pretty consistent with what we had projected in terms of what inperson voting might look like in todays election Election Commission Executive Director Neil Albrecht said during a virtual press conference  He said within the last hour Hamilton High School reported 3250 voters and Washington High School reported 2500 voters He said he did not have a number from Riverside High School which he said was too busy to tally figures at this point Riverside was the busiest voting site in the city he said  In total Albrecht anticipated each site would see between 3000 and 5000 voters Tuesday He said the city issued about 97000 absentee ballots and had so far had between a 55 and 60 return rate on those ballots Any ballot postmarked by Tuesday and received by April 13 can still be counted in the election  —  On election day many Wisconsin voters were still waiting to receive their ballot after requesting it more than two weeks ago while others couldnt get one at all after being unable to find a witness to break social distancing rules to sign their ballot certificate  Clerks face a task theyve never had before sending 13 million ballots by mail finding workers willing to risk their health on election day and providing enough masks gloves and hand sanitizer to keep everyone safe At least 50 people have contacted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in recent days reporting issues getting their ballots by mail as clerks became overwhelmed with requests Some say clerks dont even have a record of voters ballot requests  Dale Stoeber lives in Kenosha and is 71 — too old to vote safely in person and not risk developing lifethreatening complications if he catches the virus But he said hes going to have to do that  I have no choice but to vote in person with much apprehension he told the Journal Sentinel Lord help the state if it is proven down the line that this virus spreads more widely Stoeber tried to vote absentee but wasnt able to because of a state law that requires a witness signature More than 400000 absentee ballots havent been returned as of Monday according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission or 32 of the nearly 13 million ballots requested as of Monday Typically about 80 of absentee voters return their ballots For the past two weeks absentee ballots that were supposed to be mailed out to Fox Point residents have bounced back to Fox Point Village Hall In the first week the village received anywhere from 20 to 50 returned absentee ballots per day In the week leading up to Tuesdays election the village received between 100 to 150 ballots per day About 10 per day were supposed to be sent to Glendale not Fox Point On the morning of election day Fox Point Village Hall received a plastic mail bin with 175 ballots including a number of Glendale ballots The ballots are unopened and unmarked They don’t have a “return to sender” stamp or any type of explanation attached to them Village Manager Scott Botcher said Every time they received a batch of absentee ballots village officials immediately drove the ballots back to the nearest post office at 5651 N Lydell Ave They asked Post Office supervisors what was wrong with the ballots but they did not receive any explanation “We’re not sure why this happened” Botcher said “Nobody seems to be able to tell me why” Village officials did not return the batch of ballots that arrived on election day since the postal service wouldn’t have been able to deliver them to residents on the same day As residents called Village Hall inquiring about their ballots village officials browsed through that morning’s mail to see if that resident’s ballot was in the basket If it was village officials would allow residents to come to Village Hall with a photo ID to receive their ballot Residents who did not receive an absentee ballot in the mail were advised to vote in person at their polling place on election day Botcher said he plans to ask a more senior level postal official to explain the snafu for fear it could reoccur in the November election President Donald Trump on Tuesday accused Wisconsin Democrats of wanting to move the election only after he had endorsed incumbent state Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly according to USA TODAY Trump   during a Milwaukee rally in January  He also blamed Democratic Gov Tony Evers for long lines at the polls and the potential for voters to contract coronavirus when they voted in person according to USA TODAY Health officials warned that coronavirus cases may increase because thousands of people are heading to polls to vote on Tuesday Greenfield Health Department Director Darren Rausch noted that the number of cases and deaths continue to increase each day in Wisconsin which has been under a “safer at home” order by Gov Tony Evers for several weeks “We know the peak of COVID19 is still on the horizon likely in the next few weeks” Rausch said at an afternoon press briefing Because people are leaving their homes and mingling with others at election sites “it certainly will and certainly may impact the number of cases here two to three weeks out” said Rausch While many people donned masks to cast votes on Tuesday Ben Weston medical director at the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management said cloth masks do not provide much protection Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended people wear any kind of mask even homemade cloth masks “it’s important to understand cloth masks provide very limited protection from COVID19 Weston said “While they’re better than nothing there’s risk of them providing a false sense of security” said Weston adding that social distancing is still critical —  Despite all the voting chaos especially with inperson voting being canceled and reinstated consolidating four voting sites into the high school and having a record number of absentee ballots Germantown Village Administrator Steve Kreklow said this was one of his smoothest dayof voting experiences There were no lines at all during the day   “Voting was done the way we were hoping in a different situation It is amazing how everyone worked together and how people came together to make it work” said Kreklow “The public has been very understanding and great” Kreklow also said there was a shortage of 30 poll workers but 40 village employees and five members of the National Guard stepped up  He said that the village collected nearly 5000 absentee ballots “It looks like there are more absentee ballots than the last presidential election he said There were no lines inside and out of the field house   —  At Oak Creek High School lines of voters stretched out the door at times with many people observing sixfoot social distancing Because of a shortage of election workers the high school is the only voting site for the Milwaukee County community of 36000 Steve Elkes took time off from his job at a metal factory to cast his vote “I never considered voting absentee I was looking forward to coming and voting in person” said Elkes Taylor Nelson and Julie Gabriel rubbed sanitizer into their hands as they exited through a door from the high school gym Neither considered voting absentee though they were surprised by the drama on Monday with the governor ordering polling sites closed only to have the state and US supreme courts make rulings that affected the primary “I wish it would have happened sooner There was so much confusion yesterday” said Nelson “I was wondering if the election was going to go on or not” Some people wore masks some wore masks and gloves some did not Then there was Barbara Pieszak who came up with her own solution She didn’t have a mask so she made one by folding paper toweling like a flag and then stapling rubber bands at the ends “I’m not worried about what’s going on – take your precautions I’m faithbased everything happens for a reason” said Pieszak whose normal polling place is at an Oak Creek church As Pieszak waited outside Oak Creek High School for her husband to show up and vote she saw another voter leave wearing a round “I Voted” sticker stuck to her shirt “Oh no I forgot to get one of those” she said —  All but one county in Wisconsin used Wisconsin National Guard members as poll workers during Tuesday’s spring election according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission Gov Tony Evers asked the guard to make available soldiers and airmen to assist at the polls after clerks reported a massive statewide shortage of workers as the mostly elderly workforce stayed home to avoid infection Of the 2409 soldiers who worked Tuesday Milwaukee and Dane counties received the most assistance with 264 and 249 soldiers each Florence County was the only county without soldiers helping out Tuesday Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson has gotten updates from municipal clerks throughout the day reporting “long lines” at City of Milwaukee polling sites a “steady” stream of voters in Greenfield and a “pretty busy” election day in Cudahy “Poll workers are in great spirits The voters are appreciative Certainly there is some confusion at first and quite frankly some complaints over this process” Christenson said at a 330 pm virtual press briefing Christenson said municipal clerks must report the number of provisional ballots cast on Tuesday Those are ballots cast by people who do not have the proper identification but are given until Friday to present their IDs so their votes are counted All ballots cast in Milwaukee County on Tuesday including absentee ballots received by election day will be kept locked up by those clerks until the Board of Canvass count on Monday All voting equipment which have individual serial numbers and flash drives will also be stored and kept locked until the count said Milwaukee County Elections Director Julietta Henry —  For several weeks Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett has told residents to stay home practice social distancing and only go out for necessary reasons And he advocated for a mailonly election On election day he sharply criticized lawmakers who insisted on going ahead with inperson voting for the presidential primary and spring election on the scheduled day Barrett a Democrat noted that 11 other states changed primary election dates because of the coronavirus pandemic but “for purely hardball partisan reasons that did not happen here” Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele is one of thousands of residents in Wisconsin who requested but did not get an absentee ballot by Tuesday So he voted in person at South Division High School on W Lapham Boulevard Today is the last day you have until 8 pm Abele said Tuesday “You don’t have until the 13th if you want your vote counted” The county executive noted that poll workers have taken extra measures to clean election sites cleaning voting booths after every voter and handing out extra pens for those who did not want to share a pen to fill in their ballots “People have gone out of their way to make this process as safe as possible” said Abele adding that “it’s incredibly unfortunate it had to come to this” Where a Sister BayLiberty Grove firetruck usually parks instead sat a line of voting booths on Tuesday For the first time Sister Bay welcomed drivethru voting Cars pulled into the fire station garage and poll workers confirmed voters addresses checked IDs and handed them their ballots through the voters driver’s side windows People could wait to watch poll workers slide their ballots into the machine Voters could still walk in to vote Sister Bay Clerk Heidi Teich said about half of Tuesday’s voters chose to walk in The village tallied 436 voters around 330 pm already counting more than half of all registered voters according to Teich They also had over 400 absentee ballot requests Several voters drove in wearing masks and all the poll workers sported them as well Teich said the day went smoothly and voters did not wait in line for long  In West Allis a slow but steady stream of residents are making their way to the polls said West Allis City Clerk Steven Braatz Jr An unprecedented number of people requested absentee ballots for the election – about 12600 of the city’s 32000 registered voters That’s nearly three times the previous high of about 4400 absentee ballots for the 2016 presidential election and more than four times the number typically seen at an election of this size Braatz said About nine to 12 poll workers are working at each of the city’s seven polling locations a bit less than were originally scheduled That’s because Braatz said in the last 48 hours four or five poll workers contacted him to say they weren’t showing up another called this morning with the same news and there were a couple of noshows too The city is taking all the usual safety precautions at the polls Braatz said  He said about 75 of voters are wearing facemasks   Braatz said this election has presented a huge challenge “The back and forth has been very difficult to manage — the changes in the laws the court cases that have changed the processes” he said “In addition trying to manage an election during a pandemic you have to add in all the safety precautions that you wouldn’t normally add in so from my perspective it’s just been a juggernaut of the largest kind” In Green Bay fewer than 50 poll workers helped hundreds of people lined up outside East and West high schools — the only two sites open in a city accustomed to 31 polling places The chief inspector at East High School said early Tuesday that people had been patient with the process Residents — many wearing face masks — waited hours to cast their ballots while keeping their distance from one another One person at West High School started doing jumping jacks to pass the time Voters at East High School said the election was too important to sit out but expressed frustration at state officials for allowing it to proceed amid a pandemic “It’s just a scary thing right now  this is putting all of us at risk” Dale Drake said Steph Hummel who lives in Green Bay still had not received her absentee ballot in the mail Tuesday after requesting it on March 23 She assumed she wouldn’t need to leave the house to vote she said so she wasn’t equipped with a mask or gloves to protect herself Hummel was unsure if she should head to Green Bay West High School to cast her ballot and said she felt angry that she had to risk her life in order to be heard “I feel like our state is letting us down by allowing this to happen” she said Poll workers in Madison wore face masks face shields and rubber gloves as they directed people to voting booths and kept them six feet apart from each other in line At the Hawthorne Library Ben Shinners said he thought about staying away from the polls for safety reasons but decided to vote because he wants to see change He said Gov Tony Evers and other officials should have done more sooner to try to delay the election “I’m disappointed that our governor didn’t see earlier that he should have canceled this I’m also disappointed that the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not … put people first” he said “It’s hard for me to believe in our political system right now just because I really feel especially in Wisconsin it’s all just partisan stuff And I don’t think the voters are really taken into account at all” William Gilomen wore a red bandanna around his face and timed his visit to the library in the afternoon to avoid the morning and evening rushes He said he believed the city took precautions that kept voters safe “I think it went fine” he said as he rubbed his hands with sanitizer “I didn’t feel any threats or danger myself It went very smooth I think it took about three minutes” Down the street at East High School Max Dyer said he was frustrated that Republican lawmakers hadn’t gone along with Evers to delay the election He said he came to the polls to send a message to Republicans by voting for Jill Karofsky a Dane County judge running for state Supreme Court “I just feel like this is a real abuse of power by the Republicans to try to keep power” he said as he waited in line “They’ve done that ever since the governor was elected and I think they’re trying to continue to do whatever they can do to try to keep their power” Its a gorgeous April day for heading to the polls But take a coat and an umbrella A   has been issued for southeast Wisconsin including the Milwaukee area until 9 pm tonight Former US Attorney General Eric Holder slammed the decision to hold inperson voting in Wisconsin Tuesday amid the coronavirus pandemic In spite of the fact that public health experts have told everyone to practice social distancing to help fight the spread of COVID19 the Wisconsin legislature the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court are forcing too many people to wait in lines to vote today he said in a statement The pictures coming out of Wisconsin are troubling This is unnecessary and harmful Holder who served under President Barack Obama a Democrat noted that people throughout the country including every age race and background have contracted the virus Political leaders in Congress and at the state level must begin preparations now to ensure that voters do not have to choose between staying healthy or casting a vote in November Holder said No matter what you hear from the state’s Republican leadership you cannot request an email ballot today  State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos RRochester was a driving force behind keeping inperson balloting for today’s election He’s even serving as an election inspector But he’s giving out bad information when it comes to absentee voting The Wisconsin Elections Commission reiterated today that the deadline to request a ballot via email was Friday — even for those who requested a mailed ballot on time but haven’t yet received it A video posted on Twitter by journalist Parker Molloy shows Vos being asked about voters who requested ballots as of Friday but still haven’t gotten them “You have the ability to request from your clerk an email ballot” said Vos “You can fill it out and send it back in That’s what the elections board decided yesterday” That’s wrong  chairman of the state Democratic Party Wikler later deleted that tweet Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer confirmed Tuesday afternoon that Vos was mistaken saying the elections commission had guidance recently on that fact which staff hadn’t briefed him on Franklin Clerk Sandi Wesolowski said Franklin has 22000 registered voters and about 10700 requested an absentee ballot As of Monday night 7700 had been returned She said thus far it has been 48 turnout based on ballots already mailed out to residents In April 2016 the turnout in Franklin was 6553 according to Wesolowski Franklin chose to keep all polling locations open to avoid having a large group in one place which Wesolowski said “seemed like that was the opposite of what we’re telling people to do” Polling locations are equipped with sanitizer in addition to masks and gloves for workers Spray sanitizer was supplied by the state “I feel we have good resources it’s just reminding people of social distancing” she said Franklin Mayor Steve Olson highlighted how the city has ordered 20000 pens so each voter gets their own pen While Milwaukee voters have seen long lines at the polls traffic has been fairly light in suburbs like Whitefish Bay As of 130 pm fewer than 100 voters had cast inperson ballots at the Whitefish Bay Public Library one of four polling locations open in the village according to Fox Point Village President Douglas Frazer Frazier volunteered as a poll worker in Whitefish Bay because he was on the ballot in Fox Point and therefore could not be at polling locations With very few voters to greet poll workers spent most of the day entering absentee ballots into voting machines Some 70 of Whitefish Bay’s voters requested ballots by mail according to Village Manager Paul Boening Boening said the number of returned absentee ballots has not yet been calculated but absentee ballots were coming in quickly on election day About 500 ballots arrived in the morning and a steady stream of voters have been dropping off their ballots throughout the day in a box at Village Hall As mailin absentee ballot continue to arrive in the next several days Frazer said it will be difficult to tell which ballots will meet the April 7 postmark deadline as only about one in 25 — typically only those from outside of Wisconsin — are postmarked Like other communities Fox Point has mailed out absentee ballots only to have boxes of them returned as undeliverable by the US Postal Service Frazer said “I’m hoping that people who haven’t received their ballot will come out to vote” Frazer said Whitefish Bay has had some issues with absentee ballots not being delivered Boening said but the village has not received a large number of complaints As voters head to the polls during a pandemic Tuesday more than 860000 absentee ballots have already been returned to Wisconsin election clerks  We don’t know how those people voted or what party they identify with but we do know which counties those votes have come from   The piece looks at what absentee ballot returns could mean for the state Supreme Court race The counties that are generating a disproportionately high share of the absentee vote are concentrated in populous southern Wisconsin he writes In fact the three counties at the top of this list are the state’s biggest very Democratic Milwaukee and Dane and very Republican Waukesha This is not a surprise according to Gilbert These three counties represent the areas with the most coronavirus cases where voters are more motivated to vote by mail rather than in person They may also be the three most politically mobilized counties in Wisconsin he writes And they historically cast more of their vote by absentee ballot than any other counties in the state Meanwhile the counties that are generating a disproportionately low share of the absentee vote are concentrated in northern and western Wisconsin especially in the Republicanleaning 16county Green Bay media market Gilbert writes The Brookfield Conference Center is the only polling place open in the City of Brookfield Voters practiced social distancing while in line as the 18000squarefoot ballroom held more than 100 poll workers and voters Poll workers took numerous precautions to ensure the safety of voters putting tape in 6foot increments on the ground All the poll workers were wearing masks and other protective equipment Kelly Michaels the City of Brookfield clerk said things were running smoothly “It’s going about as well as can be expected for this crazy crazy election” Michaels said  Josh Otto said it took him 25 minutes to vote upon entering the building “It was cleaner than a grocery store” one voter said while exiting the building About 60 poll workers were also counting absentee ballots in a separate ballroom of the conference center   In Poynette in Columbia County there certainly weren’t any lines at the polling place at the municipal building Voter Lori Melton wore a mask and carried her own pen She wasn’t worried about there being a lot of people at the polling place because it’s a small town John Stark said he didn’t request an absentee ballot because he’s currently not working so he had time to come out and vote He said he wasn’t worried about catching the virus and that inside the polling location things were very clean Not only that he and his wife were the only ones voting at the time  Inperson voter turnout in Marathon County is higher than expected said Marathon County Clerk Kim Trueblood She said she is hearing from local clerks within the county that polling places are busy At one Wausau polling location where Trueblood stopped “voters came in steadily” while she was there she said Voters are minding new rules for social distancing at the polling places while lines have generally been short she added Only one poll worker had called in sick in Marathon County and the position was filled with a backup person according to Trueblood If voters in Marathon County prefer to request “curbside” voting they can do so by calling the phone number on signs posted in the parking lots of polling stations throughout the county Two election inspectors will bring a ballot out to the voter and process it just as if they were in the polling place No one in the village of Weston had requested curbside voting as of 130 pm Tuesday said Sherry Weinkauf clerk for the village The voter turnout in Weston had been average as of Tuesday afternoon but that could change Weinkauf added In the city of Waukesha the sole polling site according to one poll worker was “steady” throughout the morning and early afternoon Tuesday as mostly masked voters filed into the Schuetze Recreation Center The stream was heaviest shortly after the polls opened at 7 am and again between 1030 am and noon with few problems – other than a limited number of voters complaining about the circumstances and the risks said poll worker Lisa Collins “There was one woman who said ‘I can’t believe they are making us do this today’” Collins said “I agree with her It was foolish State officials had plenty of time – plenty of time – to put this on” Voting was taking place in both a side room where four voting stations were set up and in the much larger gymnasium where the crowds were more obvious she said Asked if voters had expressly voiced their concerns about exposure to COVID19 Collins said “Some have but most have not I’ve only had one man yell at me because he had to touch the door but he wasn’t wearing a mask And we’re offering masks” Waukesha which in the past has had 15 polling sites and this year had anticipated using 13 decided to combine all inperson voting to one site the centrally located large recreation center adjacent to Frame Park Gina Kozlik the city’s clerktreasurer said the primary reason was the shortage of poll workers but the number of absentee ballots submitted prior to March 31 made the decision easier No lines inside or outside were seen at several polling locations in Wauwatosa Most of the polling places in the city are reporting an average wait time of 7 to 10 minutes from the moment a voter steps into a location until they walk out according to Eva Ennamorato the communications specialist for the city “We’ve had over 50 of registered voters request an absentee ballot so we’re certainly seeing less people at the polls so that’s encouraging”  Ennamorato said Wauwatosa normally has 10 polling locations but they have cut that number down to seven  Poll workers are sitting and standing behind Plexiglas barriers at all locations and all workers are wearing protective gloves Many workers are also wearing protective masks  Hand sanitizer is also being dispensed to voters before and after voting  Ennamorato said they have received multiple calls from voters who have not received their absentee ballot yet They are telling those people to vote in person The town of Delafields three polling locations were not consolidated today to ensure less traffic in the locations according to clerk Dan Green For the 2016 presidential election the town had 625 absentee ballots This time around the clerks office has had 2660 absentee ballots returned —  Polling locations in Stevens Point and Hull were mostly quiet midTuesday morning but the village hall in Plover saw a steady stream of voters in a quickmoving line Plover voters took their places in line at designated spots set up to enforce social distancing with some wearing masks and some not Some voters came out of a sense of civic duty some never received their absentee ballot and others went to the polls while running errands Aubrie Mules 30 stood in line with her toddler waiting to vote “I think it’s very important to vote Despite everything I’m here with my toddler” Mules said Ron Rozner 64 said he didn’t receive his absentee ballot but felt safe going to the polls while out running errands despite finding the ongoing COVID19 outbreak scary He said he thought few people would be at the polls given that Plover isn’t nearly as crowded as a major city and that the county has only seen a handful of cases Jenny Peterson 43 didn’t receive her absentee ballot in time either Peterson said she thought the election should have been postponed because of the ongoing uncertainty with the flood of absentee voting and the public health emergency caused by the new coronavirus “I don’t think we should be voting today” she said Jeff Pothof chief quality and safety officer for UW Health in Madison viewed photographs taken at polling places around the state and was left with two strong very different impressions Boy Im somewhat inspired by the people who despite the risks are going out and voting he said However its nearly impossible to maintain social distancing throughout the process of going to the polls and voting You can see some people quite close to each other some wearing masks some not I mean people are trying You can see that the poll workers are trying and the people voting are trying Asked about the challenge of running an election in the midst of a pandemic Pothof said Talking with providers here in Wisconsin and across the country they look at a decision like this with incredulity — that they would hold an inperson election during the greatest public health crisis in our history —  At least 750 absentee ballots in Milwaukee are missing witness signatures and will not be counted and that number is expected to rise as the day goes on said Neil Albrecht executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission Speaking during a virtual news conference Albrecht said his office will report the number of ballots cast after polls close today but it will not report election results until next week after all absentee ballots have been received and counted As for inperson voting Albrecht said Milwaukee voters are waiting in line for as long as 2½ hours to cast their ballots We have moved forward with an election but we have not moved forward with democracy in the state of Wisconsin he said The city has only five voting centers that are open Tuesday a dramatic drop from the 180 polling places typically open on election day Albrecht said each of the five opened essentially on time and that National Guard members Milwaukee police officers and Milwaukee Health Department staffers have been helping at the voting sites But he acknowledged the average wait time was between 90 minutes and 2 hours Asked why the city wasn’t able to open more polling places with the help of the National Guard Albrecht said he didnt know until yesterday exactly how many members would be able to help at Milwaukees polling places He added that the city ended up getting about 170 members State Sen Lena Taylor a mayoral candidate in Milwaukee had harsh words for state and local leaders at Riverside High School one of the five polling places open Tuesday in Milwaukee Its unacceptable that my colleagues in Madison did not believe it important to demand that people have a safe and fair way to go to the polls said Taylor a Democrat We are leaders We should not be putting Wisconsinites in this situation If I was the majority leader I would have called the Legislature in and let the votes land the way they would land Its unacceptable Gov Tony Evers called lawmakers into special session on Saturday in order to consider postponing the election but the GOPcontrolled Legislature quickly adjourned without any action or vote On Monday GOP leaders went to the state Supreme Court which quickly overturned Evers lastminute move to delay the election on his own In an interview Taylor was also asked by reporters how she would have handled the situation differently as mayor I would have pulled individuals together earlier she said I would have  never closed the early voting I would have done more early voting locations I would have put more ballots out so that individuals could get those at sites I would have organized to help people in the lowincome housing and people who are at sites where they normally vote in their sites I would have helped the disabled and nursing homes not cancel individuals who normally go out to those sites I would have done everything to franchise people not disenfranchise people As Wisconsin’s primary draws national attention two highprofile voices from the right and the left weighed in on their Twitter feeds this morning On the right President Donald Trump urged Wisconsin voters to turn out for conservative state Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly calling him a “respected Republican” who is “tough on crime loves your Military Vets Farmers  will save your 2nd Amendment” On the left former First Lady Michelle Obama urged voters to drop their absentee ballots at their polling sites or in the mail And she urged inperson voters to “prioritize your safety and the safety of others Voting started strong at South Division High School in Milwaukee on Tuesday but it slowed by late morning By 1130 am the line was barely out the door A handful of poll workers stood ready to assist voters with curbside voting but few drove up Poll worker Natisia Martinez said about 15 to 20 cars had used the curbside voting area since polls opened at 7 am Poll workers wore masks and some wore gowns and face shields “Most people thank us for being out here” said poll worker Shane Mattner 31 “I volunteered because the mayor said he needed younger people” Emilio De Torre director of community engagement for ACLU of Wisconsin was at the school to observe and document any problems “People seem to literally be taking their life into their hands to attempt to vote” he said De Torre observed a 10minute wait at South Division while others from ACLU saw delays of 30 to 45 minutes at both Hamilton and Marshall high schools an hour and a half at Washington High School and two hours at Riverside High School De Torre said not everyone in line was keeping at least six feet apart He encouraged anyone having problems voting to contact the Election Protection Hotline at 8666878683 About two dozen cars waited in line for curbside voting outside Alexander Hamilton High School midmorning Tuesday with volunteers handing out and collecting ballots through car windows Despite the option hundreds came inside the school to vote in person The room was full the windows open for ventilation A team of masked city health officials and other volunteers watched as masked poll workers took inperson votes often from people whod chosen not to wear masks After every vote workers used alcohol wipes or disinfectant to wipe down the equipment the tables even the pens All workers had been told to change their masks every four hours All had been given at least five pairs of protective gloves Most but not all of the voters appeared to take the health warnings seriously Weve had some people swear at us in line and say its a government hoax said Julie Katrichis director of clinical operations for the Milwaukee Health Department  The National Guard is here in civilian clothes Theyre helping promote a steady flow and physical distancing Still officials acknowledged the difficulty of keeping large numbers of voters and volunteers safe in the midst of a pandemic Theres no way to keep people 100 safe Katrichis said Were just doing the best we can This was not our preference to have inperson voting But the publics cooperation has been so crucial Aaron Lipski assistant chief of the Milwaukee Fire Department was working the polls in a mask and full Tyvek suit that is made to keep particulate matter light oil and liquid away from the wearer Its an extreme challenge because nobodys ever done it before Lipski said of running an election in a pandemic Were learning as we go today Asked if he thought the voting was more dangerous for poll workers or voters Lipski said I guess the epidemiologists will figure that out in a couple of weeks Id say everybody passing through in these close proximities is at risk In the village of Palmyra where a   is among the races on the ballot a total of 83 voters had visited the polls by 930 am said Palmyra Village ClerkTreasurer Laurie Mueller The village’s lone polling location was shifted from village hall to the community center at PalmyraEagle MiddleHigh School to provide more space she said and some but not all voters were wearing masks Mueller said a volunteer at the door is spraysanitizing everyones hands as they enter and voters are being instructed to take a pen to vote and then either throw it away or take it home with them Poll workers outfitted with masks and gloves are working behind sneeze guards made by the village’s public works employees There are Xes on the floor at 6foot intervals   “We have a person wiping down the poll booths after everyone votes and then randomly wiping down other areas in the voting location” she said Along with the new location and safety provisions Mueller said there’s clearly a different vibe at the polls “There’s not a lot of visiting and chitchatting” she said “It’s pretty much come in and do your business and move on which is good We don’t want people hanging out” The school board election comes about a month after the   a costsaving move identified by the board after the state rejected its dissolution attempt in January Posters across social media — including one shared by the chairman of the state Democratic party — have claimed ballots can be emailed now to voters who don’t want to get one in person That is not the case said Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney That deadline passed last week The deadline for mailed or emailed ballot requests was Friday Until that date voters could request a ballot by email fax or through the commission’s website The only way for residents to cast a vote today even those who previously requested an absentee ballot that hasn’t yet arrived is by going to their local polling place in person Ben Wikler chair of the state Democratic Party tweeted Monday about email still being an option but he later deleted it “He was wrong” Magney said On their oneyear engagement anniversary Casey Hughes and Kayla Haessler spent the morning waiting to vote at Riverside High School in Milwaukee The couple arrived at 730 am lining up blocks away from the school entrance and said they were given masks by the Milwaukee Health Department an hour later Two and a half hours later they were inside the school waiting in line on Xs marked with tape to guide social distancing  — Rory Linnane Taking a page from the City of Milwaukee  the city of Oshkosh began offering curbside voting Tuesday According to a post on the city access channels Facebook page poll workers will bring ballots out to vehicles wait while they are filled out and take them inside to enter into the voting machine  City Manager Mark Rohloff has said he anticipated a low turnout given the city had sent out over 10000 absentee ballots in the past few weeks In Winnebago County clerks had sent out 38830 absentee ballots as of Tuesday morning according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission Bucking the trend in other cities Appleton kept all 15 of its polling places open Tuesday At 9 am at St Bernard Catholic Church on the citys southwest side turnout was low with just a handful of voters and a short waiting time Eight poll workers manned the stations which were spread out throughout the room There were taped Xes on the floor and signs directing voters to maintain a proper distance with others In a morning blog post the Wisconsin Election Commission said there were no reports of polling places unable to open on Tuesday It said the National Guard was deployed to assist in the elections and that   which offers information on polling places races on ballots and more was operating well To our understanding the National Guard members have all reported to their municipality or county this morning the post said We have a National Guard liaison in our office today to help with coordination and deployment should an emergency arise Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned voters heading to the polls in Wisconsins primary Tuesday to take the needed precautions to stay safe saying that he knows that people in the past have died for the right to vote I say as a black man that I know that people have died for the right to vote Adams said during an interview with the TODAY show Tuesday This is very important to our entire country and if people are going to go out there and vote then please do it as safely as possible Wisconsin is holding its primary Tuesday amid the coronavirus pandemic Wisconsin Gov Tony Evers a Democrat tried to postpone the election until June 9 and expand absentee voting However his executive order was overruled by the Wisconsin Supreme Court At Green Bay West High School more than 100 people had already lined up to vote shortly after polls opened each keeping a safe distance from each other to reduce the risk of the spread of the coronavirus Terry Sipes who normally would vote at St Elizabeth Seton School said she attempted to vote by mail but her absentee ballot did not arrive in time She checked online at 5 am to make sure the landscape hadnt changed after the state and US Supreme Courts in separate rulings ordered the election to take place and overturned a lower courts order to extend the time for clerks to send out and count absentee ballots Absentee ballots must be either postmarked today or returned to a polling place or local clerks office by 8 pm today Sipes said nothing was going to keep me away from voting in person once it was clear that inperson voting would take place First of all there is no way I would not vote today No way Sipes said of her decision to vote Tuesday Just the fact that we have the right to vote and if we dont exercise that right to vote were screwed as a country Green Bay is operating just two polling places today at East and West high schools Polls are open until 8 pm Ryan Findlay voted at South Division High School just after polls opened at 7 am He posted this on Facebook This is just my experience at my polling place  but the volunteers here did an amazing job Everyone in masks and gloves keeping everyone in line six feet apart offering hand sanitizer to everyone as they walk in the door everyone gets their own pen voting booths all staged six feet apart and wiping down the booths after every use If you’re on the fence or feeling uneasy today maybe this will help a bit At the Polish Center of Wisconsin 6941 S 68th St in Franklin poll workers wore gloves and masks At the entrance to vote there was a box of pens that voters used to fill out their ballot and were told to keep Next to the box was a large jug of hand sanitizer  There were pieces tape on the floor roughly six feet apart marking where people should stand when checking in to vote When voters presented their photo ID they placed it on a long narrow strip of plastic so poll workers could move the ID toward them to inspect and hand it back without touching anything After voters were finished filling out their ballot a poll worker sanitized the booth the voter used  No I voted stickers were given out to reduce the chance of spreading the coronavirus   As of Tuesday at 730 am Wisconsinites have returned 864750 absentee ballots out of 1282762 requested There was surge of nearly 140000 absentee ballots returned since the numbers that were reported on Monday Among the states three largest counties Milwaukee County had returned 124960 absentee ballots out of 203898 requested or 61 Waukesha County had returned 97298 out of 128286 requested 76 and Dane County had returned 122302 out of 178828 requested 68 Wisconsin is now reporting 864750 absentee ballots returned for April election — that is more than the number of absentee ballots cast for president in Wisconsin in 2016 And most of those 2016 absentees were inperson early votes Most of these April 2020 absentee ballots are mail Another factor to consider during the many issues facing the April 7 election Rain According to the   Wisconsins chances of precipitation increase in the evening jumping from 22 percent in the 3 pm hour to 52 percent in the 5 pm hour before leveling off again as darkness falls Temperatures meanwhile will elevate into the upper 60s and top out in the low 70s for the evening In New Berlin local police said they are assisting the election committee and voting citizens at all seven polling places Our goal is to keep everyone safe by using good social distancing guidelines the police said in a Facebook post While these are not laws we will be asking for everyones assistance today to prevent the spread of COVID 19 Our officers will be wearing glasses N95 masks and gloves to do their best to protect themselves Please respect their distance in these uncharted times Photos from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel photographer Mike De Sisti show the scene at Riverside University High School in Milwaukee Marcia Triggs a City of Milwaukee Health Department disease intervention specialist hands out masks Michael Claus 66 was among the several hundred people who showed up early to vote at Riverside People died for my right to vote so if I have to take a risk to vote thats what I have to do he said Im kind of disappointed in our representatives who are trying to suppress our right to vote by having us about during a pandemic Health concerns have left Wisconsin polling locations shortstaffed many have closed or been consolidated The remaining workers — and volunteers whove stepped up to fill the void — will be following guidelines such as cleaning voting stations and wearing masks and gloves But they worry about the possibility of contracting the virus while ensuring that the election moves forward I think that this is just a signal that we need to figure out a system so that people can vote in every location said Amy Sholis wholl be volunteering as a poll worker in Fitchburg on Tuesday Im happy that there are people willing to step in and put their lives on the line she said but maybe that isnt the best system to rely on to make sure the democratic process remains intact "},

{"6960": "President Donald Trump’s attack on his own health experts’ guidance for safely reopening schools cracked open for public display a power struggle within the administration that has been building for months Trump blasted the guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday as “very tough  expensive” and “asking schools to do very impractical things” But CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield said on Thursday the guidance would stand and his staff would provide some new documents to clarify the recommendations   Wednesday’s flareup punctuates a conflict escalating for months with the nation’s top scientists publicly sidelined in the Trump administration’s initial coronavirus response Earlier disagreements delayed the release of the reopening guidance for schools and businesses Public health leaders who worked at the CDC under prior presidents said they had never seen anything like this week’s open discord Those signals can impair the guidance and the White House coronavirus task force itself the experts said  It undermines leadership for everyone involved” said Dr Jeffrey Koplan vice president for global health at Emory University and a former CDC director who bristled at the idea that expense should drive school decisions I don’t remember hearing that for the airports and bars” Its public health malpractice to say Open without worrying about anything’ he said  The CDC’s current recommendations which urge America’s frequently overcrowded classrooms to put six feet of distance between every student desk have seen increasing scrutiny as communities grapple with how to safely resume classes as early as next month  The nation’s pediatricians for example recently called out the CDC’s sixfoot guidance It said such stringent distancing could do more harm than good by forcing schools to reduce classroom capacity The start of a new school year comes as many states especially in the Sunbelt region confront a surge in coronavirus cases after reopening everything from restaurants to day camps The Trump administration’s loose guidance gave states and localities wide leeway on how to end a nationwide shutdown during the early weeks of the pandemic  The school question is particularly fraught Children have not been sickened by the new coronavirus as adults yet spreading it remains a concern with reopening schools The nation’s experiment with virtual education in the spring was widely panned as a failure showcasing inequities in the nations digital divide and asking many parents to serve as their children’s teachers while also juggling their work  Vice President Mike Pence who leads the White House coronavirus task force said on Thursday new documents would be issued next week supplementing the original guidelines He had previously cited those same plans at a press conference earlier in the week The White House did not respond to questions seeking clarity about how the supplemental documents which have not yet been released might impact the previous recommendations The CDC pointed to Redfield’s comments in an interview with ABC on Thursday that the agency would “provide additional information to help the schools be able to use the guidance that we put forward” Devin O’Malley press secretary for Pence declined to comment on how these guidelines which the White House has now labeled inadequate passed through the task force’s review process  “This week the administration and task force have elevated the conversation around reopening schools to the national level” O’Malley said pointing to the federal government’s role in helping local communities safely reopen schools  The CDC’s school reopening guidelines first published in May were part of a larger battery of recommendations for reopening the country safely that had previously received scrutiny and approval from the task force Administration officials had labeled earlier versions overly prescriptive after reports that they shelved guidance  USA TODAY has reported multiple instances since February in which CDC officials at odds with the White House felt pressured to bend public health guidance or ignore scientific evidence  Recently the   blaming Latinos for regional spikes in new coronavirus cases The White House also has pushed for a return to the failed strategy of relying on temperature screenings to detect coronavirus infections in airlines passengers despite the strong objections of CDC scientists  “Hyperpoliticized messaging makes it hard to adapt to and use the sciencedriven information” said Alonzo Plough a longtime former public health director in major US cities now the chief science officer and vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation He also serves as an independent scientific advisor to the CDC’s Center for Preparedness and Response “It costs us in terms of increasing case counts and mortality”   The politicized role of the CDC in the coronavirus pandemic prompted nearly 350 public health organizations to sign a letter last week asking Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to affirm the agency’s role in providing evidencebased scientific guidance “It is a scientific organization that functions best as an apolitical agency trusted to guide the strategy of our nation to be healthier and safer” noted the letter signed by groups representing the nation’s pediatricians and state health officers “We must amplify the unfettered voice of CDC not stifle it” Nancy Cox the CDCs former director of the influenza division who worked at the agency for almost 30 years said the public pushback from the administration is selfdefeating because the guidelines currently in place are in line with those of European countries that successfully reopened schools  Im just speechless” Cox said of Trump’s criticism via Twitter She noted that such disagreements usually occur out of public view to avoid confusing people Ive never seen anything quite like what happened yesterday”  The school guidance has been a touch point for Trump who wants to bring students back to campuses Public health experts are also increasingly concerned about the toll on children’s wellbeing with many depending on schools to provide everything from nutritious meals to safeguards against abuse But with the start of the school year weeks away the US lacks a blueprint for a safe return The nation’s largest school system in New York City on Wednesday announced plans to limit classroom instruction to one to three days per week in the fall staggering schedules to reduce classroom crowding Florida Governor Ron DeSantis a Trump ally wants to see instruction five days per week which his education department required this week via an emergency order Localities are still weighing their options as the state sees a surge in coronavirus cases The CDC’s reopening guidance does not envision a normal school year for America’s campuses and presents logistical challenges for the nation’s school districts which range widely in the size and diversity of their student populations and the funding available to serve them    It encouraged schools to space desks out by six feet – the recommended distance for physical distancing in many settings to limit the spread of the COVID19 virus – and suggested that school buses when possible run with empty rows between students The  offering an alternative to the CDC’s distancing recommendations It highlighted more recent evidence suggesting that three feet of distance between desks could be adequate especially when coupled with face masks If elementary schools strictly impose sixfoot distancing it noted the “harm may outweigh potential benefits”  Dr Nathaniel Beers a pediatrician who helped to develop the AAP’s guidance explained that the CDC’s strict distancing recommendations could reduce the number of students attending class by 50 percent forcing shorter or fewer instructional days “That has huge ramifications” he said “Our goal was to make sure that we were encouraging a robust conversation at the local level about what was possible and what the decisions meant” State officials relying on the CDC to sift through the science on how to reopen schools are now left waiting for the updated recommendations We have seen what happens when you reopen states economies too quickly said Dr Marcus Plescia chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials noting public health experts share the president’s desire to resume classroom instruction safely “We don’t want to reopen school and they have another setback and disaster”"},

marketing boon signaled the emergence of Abbott as a frontrunner in the arms race to develop what the current and former FDA commissioners have called gamechanging tests Broadscale coronavirus results could allow Americans to return to normal armed with knowledge of the disease’s spread Realities in labs and clinics across the country show that even the most promising test improvements still trail the massive surge in diagnostics the country needs according to those who have been denied access to prompt testing – and even those able to get their hands on the Abbott machines In frustration many are striking out on their own President Trump called the 66pound ID NOW instrument   It delivers positive tests in five minutes and negatives in about 13 Trump and those around him pressed the portable ID NOW units into service at the White House this week with Trump saying he took the Abbott test on April 3 and was negative Visitors expected to be near the president or the vice president are being given the rapid nasopharyngeal swab test including members of the press corps attending the daily task force briefing In the outside world experts say rapid tests likely will play a smaller role one more often aimed at the sickest patients who stand to benefit most from the fiveminute positive results “These tests are much lower throughput but for the sickest patients in the ICU or arriving in the emergency room you want that result sooner than hours or days” said Frederick Nolte director of clinical laboratories at the Medical University of South Carolina Even inside Abbott the message has been much more subdued than the administrations hype Spokeswoman Darcy Ross said the company and its CEO have been careful not to overpromise acknowledging their pointofcare rapid tests will only be a part of a testing solution for coronavirus and are aimed at health care workers and first responders Allocation of the soughtafter instruments and the tests that feed them has been done in coordination with state and federal officials but customers ultimately determine how our tests are allocated Ross said So far the company has shipped about 500000 of the rapid tests which run on instruments that sell for 4500 apiece to all 50 states Washington DC Puerto Rico and the Pacific Islands In addition it has shipped about a million tests worldwide that run on a different instrument – m2000 RealTime molecular lab tests – to the more than 200 alreadyoperational machines nationwide Those tests take about eight hours to return results “We see it as part of the

Steve Hahn   in rapid diagnostics  “This is big news and will help get more of these tests out in the field rapidly” he said  Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb echoed that sentiment with an all

day with a turnaround of eight hours CEO Tomislav Mihaljevic told MSNBC Oschner has several of the Abbot ID NOW instruments currently in use The same technology rapidly detects influenza and strep

other cases he said it’s not critical to have an immediate result Alex Billioux assistant secretary of health for the Office of Public Health in Louisiana said the quick tests could be useful for

get out of it Alere sued in 2016 to enforce the agreement Abbott responded with a countersuit The two stood down in 2017 before the cases went to trial  Since the president put Abbott on the national stage investors have boosted the company’s stock price 35 percent Wall Street analysts say coronavirus testing will add 1 billion to the Illinois companys revenue this year While slowdowns in other health sectors will dent Abbott’s growth projections still show the company emerging from 2020 with 34 billion in revenue The rocky acquisition of Alere and its ID NOW tests look fortuitous in hindsight said Edward Jones analyst Ashlyn Evans She said despite public attention and the crush for development she expected Abbott to take advantage of a global footprint in the months ahead “Headlines can be flashy but they are developing lots of different tests” Evans said “As a leader in pointofcare diagnostics this huge demand will only benefit Abbott” Abbott points to its long history with diagnostics in health emergencies It developed the first FDAapproved test to screen blood donors for HIV in 1985 The company’s roots trace to 1888 and Wallace Abbott’s pharmacy and remedy development in Chicago The company cranked out penicillin during WWII acquired popular baby formula brand Similac in the 1960s developed the wellknown immunosuppressive drug Humira in 2002 and has recently been on the cutting edge of continuous glucose monitoring for diabetics Abbott spun off its pharmaceutical development with the creation of sister company AbbVie in 2013 But despite that spinoff the company still endured some ugly investigations into its work with anticonvulsant drug Depakote and other products In 2012 Abbott pleaded guilty and agreed to pay 15 billion in criminal and civil liability tied to unlawful promotion of Depakote to elderly dementia patients in nursing homes In 2018 Abbott and AbbVie also paid 25 million to settle with the federal government over allegations the company had employed kickbacks and unlawful promotion of the anticholesterol drug TriCor dating back to 2006 before the split While the White House continues to promote Abbott’s fiveminute test the companys other testing instrument the m2000 could end up playing a much bigger role in addressing the scarcity of testing American labs rely on about 200 of the m2000 machines nationwide for various other tests like HIV and hepatitis Oschner which has one in Louisiana is considering buying a second In South Carolina the machine is seen as a workhorse said Nolte the Medical University lab director He uses the machine to do about 500 coronavirus tests per day Nolte said he called Abbott to order an ID NOW test instrument and was told it would be unavailable since the units were first shipping to hardesthit states Nolte heard the same from Cepheid which has produced its own rapid test He also says a third company BioFire Diagnostics will be competing for the rapid testing market in t coming weeks As of Friday the FDA had received applications for more than 270 test developers and already granted emergency use authorization to 32 for new diagnostic tests Though he sees developing technology and capacity moving in the right direction Nolte worries the FDA’s emergency authorizations for the companies could have negative consequences He said the tests’ true sensitivity and specificity to the virus is unknown without comparing them in rigorous testing A flood of false positives and negatives could lead to disastrous public health outcomes “The FDA tried to lock this down and put down some guard rails then things with the virus were getting out of control and a lot of fingers started being pointed about the lack of tests” Nolte said “That pressure and all the publicity led to the FDA and White House starting to take the guardrails off “I don’t know how to say this and not sound like I’m on both sides of the fence—but we’ve gone too far It’s frightening”"},

{"2778": "WASHINGTON – A series of White House attacks on Dr Anthony Fauci underscore President Donald Trumps dilemma over how to handle a highprofile adviser within his administration who has a penchant for straight talk and whose popularity exceeds the presidents own  Supporters of the president have aired their frustrations over Faucis prominence in the administrations coronavirus response in recent weeks but medical experts fear a clash of messages could dilute public health warnings The White House added to the confusion about its broadsides on Fauci by disavowing an oped by trade adviser Peter Navarro on Wednesday Navarro wrote an opposing view to a USA TODAY   that called Fauci a “national treasure” and said efforts to muzzle him would be hazardous USA TODAY typically publishes an opposing view to its editorials from an outside voice   “We went directly to Navarro who we know has been critical of Fauci” said Bill Sternberg editorial page editor at USA TODAY “We have no information on whether he attempted to clear this with the White House” The White House on Wednesday sought to distance itself from Navarro’s comments Navarro’s   published Tuesday evening includes some comments about Fauci the trade adviser had  – comments the White House did not repudiate at the time White House director of strategic communications Alyssa Farah wrote in a Wednesday tweet that Navarros   was not approved by the White House and was the opinion of Peter alone Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office Wednesday about Navarros oped Trump said Thats Peter Navarro but I have a very good relationship with Dr Fauci Asked again about the oped when leaving the White House Trump said Were all on the same team Including Dr Fauci  Trump said Navarro made a statement representing himself  He shouldnt be doing that he added  Fauci commented on the controversy in a series of   published with The Atlantic later Wednesday  “I can’t explain Peter Navarro Fauci said of the criticism He’s in a world by himself” Fauci called the attacks on him from within the White House bizarre and said it hurts the president to do that  When the staff lets out something like that and the entire scientific and press community push back on it it ultimately hurts the president he said  Fauci said he told White House chief of staff Mark Meadows it was a big mistake but Meadows did not offer an apology Complicating the situation for Trump and allies who have been attacking Fauci is the high degree of trust Fauci has with a broad swath of Americans A poll from Morning Consult and Politico released Wednesday showed American voters giving Fauci high marks for his handling of the coronavirus response with 62 of voters saying Faucis work was excellent or good By contrast only 36 of voters said Trump was doing an excellent or good job in handling the pandemic In Washington many Republican lawmakers have pushed back on attacks on Fauci Speaking to reporters in Kentucky on Wednesday Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he had total confidence in the 79yearold infectious disease expert   said that any focus on Fauci is a distraction from the countrys recovery from the coronavirus  Getting in a contest with Dr Fauci about whether he was right or wrong doesnt move the ball forward he said  We dont have a Dr Fauci problem Graham said We need to be focusing on doing things that get us to where we need to go So I have all the respect in the world for Dr Fauci I think any effort to undermine him is not going to be productive quite frankly Navarros comments in the opposing view piece echoed previous criticisms leveled by Trump against the longtime career civil servant In an interview last Thursday with Fox News Sean Hannity Trump said Fauci had made a lot of mistakes but called him a nice man The president appeared to step back from the criticism in a Monday roundtable with people who have been helped by law enforcement saying he had a very good relationship with Dr Fauci  I find him to be a very nice person I dont always agree with him Trump said  But as the White House sought to distance itself from Navarros oped other top Trump allies and staff have ramped up their public attacks on Fauci One of Trumps top allies in the House Rep Andy Biggs RAriz denounced Fauci and coronavirus task force leader Dr Deborah Birx in a Monday tweet accusing him of having decimated the American economy and society with their policy decisions  Biggs who leads the conservative Freedom Caucus has written close to a dozen opeds criticizing Fauci and Birxs response to the pandemic and his antiFauci posts have been retweeted by some other House Republicans as well  Stephen Moore a conservative economist and a member of the presidents task force to reopen the economy told USA TODAY he and his team at the Committee to Unleash Prosperity are compiling a policy memo to highlight Faucis record as a longtime government health official claiming hes been wrong on predicting the course of pandemics Hes become a big problem for Trump because he keeps contradicting what the White House is saying Moore said Obviously hes had his run and now the White House is trying to distance themselves from him And thats become a PR nightmare A recent newsletter for the Committee to Unleash Prosperity previewed Moores memo which is expected to argue that media coverage of Fauci has rarely offered any context beyond glowing profiles of the doctor and his clashes with Trump which is why its incumbent upon the White House to point out how frequently fears voiced by Fauci proved unfounded Moore said while he doesnt have a problem with coronavirus guidelines such as social distancing or wearing masks Fauci has been a very negative influence for the country and for the White House in his remarks on curbing plans to reopen the economy  White House officials have said Fauci is one of several health experts who advise the administration and that the president is balancing public health advice against the economic toll coronavirus has taken on the country  Its very unusual that someone like Fauci would be able to last as long as he has given how often he has contradicted what Trump is saying and sometimes even does it at while theyre at a press conference Moore said Its time for him to go away The Trump administration is facing problems with its clash of messages on coronavirus guidance said Dr Richard Besser who was acting CDC head during the H1N1 pandemic and is now the president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation  Amid this mixed messaging and political infighting his advice to Fauci was stick to the science  Asked what health officials should do if their opinions are ignored Besser said it should not change what you said  Science was not the only factor in decisionmaking Besser said but its critically important that you dont compromise or distort what the science says as youre making policy decisions There needs to be a discussion between those experts and those who are elected to make policy decisions but you should never have your guidance undercut by those who are in political office he said Inside the White House aides appear at odds over how to manage the Fauci problem  White House Press Secretary  about tensions between Fauci and the president When asked about a statement released by the White House last weekend asserting that several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr Fauci has been wrong on things McEnany told reporters it was a response to specific questions by the Washington Post But the pointbypoint list of criticisms of Fauci was circulated to several news organizations in addition to the Washington Post and mirrored several of the criticisms leveled by Navarro As McEnany insisted relations were fine between her boss and his top health expert Dan Scavino the White House director of social media came under fire for posting a cartoon on Facebook portraying Fauci as a faucet flushing the US economy down the drain Sorry Dr Faucet he posted At least you know if I’m going to disagree with a colleague such as yourself it’s done publicly – and not cowardly behind journalists with leaks Asked in a Tuesday   with Dr Abdul ElSayed on Crooked Media if he would ever leave the administration out of frustration Fauci said Walking away from it is not the solution I think it would make things worse  Adm Brett Giroir who oversees coronavirus testing  on Tuesday the members of the coronavirus task force have a great collegial relationship and pushed back on accusations that government health officials are lying about the pandemic  We may occasionally make mistakes based on the information we have but none of us lie Giroir said contradicting a Twitter post by former game show host Chuck Woolery shared by Trump accusing government officials and doctors of lying about the coronavirus crisis Giroir said guidance may be updated as experts learn more about the virus including whether to wear a mask but that the task force is honest We are completely transparent with the American people he said  Woolery later walked back his comments and noted his son tested positive for the coronavirus  In a Sunday interview on NBCs Meet the Press Giroir said “I respect Dr Fauci a lot but Dr Fauci is not 100 percent right and he also doesn’t necessarily and he admits that have the whole national interest in mind  “He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view he said  But health experts are puzzled about attempts to undermine one of the nations top doctors as the    Dr Howard Koh former assistant Health and Human Services secretary under the Obama administration argued Faucis presence is need now more than ever  Time and again the country has always turned to Tony to give the toplevel scientific insight and guidance going forward he said of Fauci who has been a national voice on global health crises ranging from the HIVAIDS epidemic to Ebola  In a time like this with the worst pandemic weve had in a century we need Dr Fauci front and center every day For critics who say Fauci has changed his thinking on coronavirus guidance Koh said its the role of a public health expert to make the best recommendations possible understanding that things could always change and evolve Every step of the way he has been open and honest about what is known and what is not known he added And I have phenomenal respect for the fact that then hes willing to change when the data and the knowledge changes thats what a good scientist does  The  said Monday it is extremely concerned and alarmed by efforts to discredit Fauci  Taking quotes from Dr Fauci out of context to discredit his scientific knowledge and judgment will do tremendous harm to our nation’s efforts to get the virus under control restore our economy and return us to a more normal way of life the organization said in a statement Ron Klain the former Ebola czar under the Obama administration and a campaign adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden said attacks on Fauci are part of a broader White House strategy Deny the danger doubt the science disparage the truthtellers That doesn’t put Tony Fauci at risk but it has put all the rest of us in peril – and it is why the US response is failing so badly even as other countries succeed in getting COVID under control he said  While Trump has a history of removing officials who have fallen out of favor with the president supporters of Fauci note that hes survived six presidencies – both Republican and Democratic  Klain who said he spoke to Fauci nearly every day during the Ebola response said its unlikely Fauci is concerned with White House criticism Dr Fauci has devoted his life to fighting deadly illnesses having faced down those threats I doubt the absurd and juvenile attacks from the White House concern him said Klain Even if Fauci loses his platform Besser said he hopes he sticks around Hes a brilliant scientist and he has had an uncanny ability to not just survive but thrive in administrations of both parties he said"},

{"1567": "COLUMBUS Ohio – Students wont be in classrooms next week Prominent sports events from   to   have been canceled or postponed Churches and synagogues are livestreaming services  Life as we know it   in America And its changed   The Midwestern state has been leading the nations response to COVID19 the infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus While President Donald Trump was slow to shut down public events including the Republicans own campaign rallies Ohio Gov Mike DeWines administration imposed the nations most restrictive ban on large gatherings He then closed all schools for at least three weeks DeWine a Republican made those decisions before anyone died of COVID19 in Ohio and with just a handful of confirmed cases concentrated in the northeastern part of the state Those decisions earned DeWine the ire of sports fans frustrated parents and those who claimed coronavirus was a mediamanufactured crisis But they earned him praise from unlikely sources Democratic Sen Sherrod Brown and Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper who ran against DeWine for state attorney general in 2014  The approaches by DeWine and POTUS could not be more starkly different    “This is certainly no ordinary time DeWine said Monday when the states first three cases of coronavirus were confirmed It is important for us to take aggressive action to protect Ohioans The actions that we take now will in fact save lives That we are sure of” On Monday DeWine 73 was running over an hour late to a news conference about a mental health pilot program When he finally took the lectern he was flanked by Lt Gov Jon Husted and Ohio Department of Health Director Dr Amy Acton in a crisp white lab coat Three Ohioans had just tested positive for COVID19  Now coronavirus wasnt a problem for faroff Wuhan China or even Washington state It was an Ohio problem DeWine and Acton had been preparing for this moment for weeks – meeting with medical professionals sounding the alarm at public appearances and studying Italys disastrous response  In some ways DeWine has been preparing for this moment for much longer  Acton was the last Cabinet member DeWine selected in 2019 wanting to make sure he had the right person  Before Acton the state health department had been led by two directors who were not medical doctors DeWine thought it was important to change that  Acton 54 earned her medical degree from Northeastern Ohio University completed her internship and residency and then earned a master’s degree in public health She spent seven years teaching global public health at Ohio State University In daily press briefings Acton is DeWines explainerinchief But perhaps drawing on her days in the classroom she does so with clarity and empathy often sharing her own feelings and personal prevention steps Shes explained complex health concepts with analogies Swiss cheese stars in space extinguishing a fire on your stove top Fridays public briefing included a short history lesson on planning for pandemics ranging from the Spanish flu to H1N1 in 2009 On the front end of a pandemic you look a little bit like an alarmist You look a little bit like a Chicken Little – the sky is falling Acton said On the back end of the pandemic you didnt do enough For casual observers it might seem DeWine is doing too much But the states multistep response – an expert panel a statewide summit ample media accessibility – is how he approaches big issues such as human trafficking and opioid abuse As a lifelong politician DeWine has cultivated relationships with reporters across the state And he is no stranger to worldwide media firestorms  In August DeWine  yelling Do something in Dayton after a mass shooting in the citys Oregon District He was in the spotlight as the states top cop when   Ohios preparation for the novel coronavirus didnt start this week In early February   tested negative for coronavirus Acton conveyed a cautionary message then The risk is to those who have traveled abroad She advised people who had traveled and felt ill to call their doctor In late February Acton traveled to Washington DC to meet with health officials from other states the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House By that point Acton and DeWine were talking daily sometimes multiple times a day Their message morphed into a guide to coronavirus symptoms – fever cough shortness of breath Acton described the coronavirus as flulike – many people will have it and just feel sick for a little while but some will need hospitalization Much was still unknown the pair said at a Feb 27 news conference in Cleveland but they made a big promise that day We will communicate what we know when we know it Soon after DeWine convened a panel of 15 medical professionals including leaders from the states major hospitals Now the 31st floor of the Riffe Center where the governor has his office has transformed into a war room with twicedaily conference calls with his panel and calls to a publichealth expert in Boston to assess the pandemic and its threat As DeWine rolls out bans closures and orders he notes that they are based on the advice of experts The experts have been telling him the virus is here but were not seeing it because there hasnt been enough testing The aggressive measures are an attempt to slow the spread and reduce a big spike in infections that could overload the health care system   that Acton revisits at each briefing “Mistakes that I have made throughout my career have generally been because I didn’t have enough facts I didn’t dig deep enough DeWine said So I made up my mind I was going to have the best information the best data available” DeWine knows that other governors are watching what Ohio does In todays media environment Kentucky or Indianas leaders might know Ohios actions within 30 seconds He doesnt mind explaining why Ohio is taking these dramatic steps He took a couple of national media interviews at the end of the week to break it down But really the reasons are simple he said “We’re basing this on science”"},

developed its own US forecast for the spread of the coronavirus It’s one model that states are utilizing as they consider the duration of directives on social distancing and restrictions on business With support from the US Energy Department the Los Alamos model builds upon a decade of past experience in forecasting contagions including the seasonal flu the Ebola virus and mosquitoborne Chikungunya Last year Los Alamos statisticians beat out more than 20 teams in a CDC competition aimed at improving flu forecasting using supercomputing power The lab’s “Dante” model was most successful in predicting the peak and shortterm intensity of the unfolding flu season – and became the basis for the new COVID19 model Hospitals in parts of the state will be able to conduct

each others records related to the global superpower For President Donald Trump the focus on former Vice President Joe Bidens record on China comes as he   of his administrations response to the coronavirus pandemic He has also ramped up his criticism of China’s handling of the initial coronavirus outbreak On the other side Biden is using Trumps previously complimentary remarks about China as part of the argument that he is better qualified to lead the country through the pandemic and the recovery  By pinning blame for coronavirus on China Trump is looking to find traction as public opinion of his handling of the crisis   Biden has sought to exploit those openings while touting his own dealings with the nation as vice president And as the rhetoric escalates advocates are also urging caution about the focus on China given a   Experts said the response from Biden signals a willingness to take a page out of Trumps playbook to get in front of the presidents attacks  When someone punches you you punch them back harder – thats kind of 101 out of the Trump campaign from the primary and the general in 2016 said John Della Volpe director of polling at Harvard Universitys Institute of Politics To me that was an element of that strategy from Biden But you also have the relevant information of record over the last 90 days And the presidential campaign isnt the only race being touched by the escalation in Chinarelated rhetoric A 57page strategy   for Senate Republicans campaign arm   on by Politico advised candidates when asked about Trumps handling of the coronavirus pandemic “Don’t defend Trump other than the China Travel Ban – attack China The elevation of China as a campaign issue escalated over the month of April  The Trump campaign took aim first slamming in tweets and ads Bidens initial criticism of Trumps ban on travel from China Trump allies have   the former vice president as Beijing Biden while the president has increasingly accused China of concealing the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic before it spread globally  We are not happy with China Trump said at a Monday coronavirus task force news conference adding that his administration would be pursuing investigations into Chinas handling of the pandemic  In turn the Biden camp has attacked Trumps praise of China early in the coronavirus pandemic as Americans were beginning to getting sick  Trump praised the Chinese government instead of taking action to combat the coronavirus read a Monday email from the Biden campaign that extensively quoted from a Politico article   15 times Trump praised China as coronavirus was spreading across the globe  The Trump campaigns first volley launched this month an online ad called     It highlights Biden saying This is no time for Donald Trumps record of hysterical xenophobia after Trump limited air travel from China in January though Biden later   his position in support of the travel restrictions The ad then pivots to the business dealings of Joe Bidens son Hunter in China It is in our best selfinterest for China to be able to prosper the elder Biden is shown saying in a clip from a 2011   at Sichuan University in Chengdu China as ominous music plays A caption then appears No Just Bidens interest But the Biden campaign quickly pushed back using Trumps words tweets and policy decisions to portray a president who had a blind eye to China A little over a week later the Biden campaign   its own ad and videos on social media to present its side of the story  The Biden campaign accused Trump of trying to hide that he failed to act providing several rebuttals   It includes Bidens   before the outbreak spread in the US where he wrote Trumps actions left us unprepared for a pandemic remarks from a debate where Biden demanded American health authorities be allowed into China in a call for transparency and reporting of 15 instances where Trump praised China including a Jan 24 tweet praising Chinas efforts and transparency Trump rolled over for the Chinese a voice over in the the ad says Look around it continues later noting the millions of people out of work and tens of thousands killed by COVID19 Donald Trump left this country unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime In a campaign memo distributed to Democratic officeholders earlier in April Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield unveiled four key talking points to frame Trumps response to the coronavirus Atop the list The Chinese government He praised its leader and did not fight anywhere near hard enough to get the facts the memo reads In response Trump campaign deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews said Trump has always been resolute in taking early action again pointing to Trumps travel restrictions on China In contrast before and during the coronavirus crisis Joe Biden stood up for China dismissed them as an economic threat and initially opposed President Trump’s China travel restrictions she said in a statement  The focus on China however seems to have occurred simultaneously with a shift in public opinion on China and Chinese people  A poll released last week by Pew Research Center   about twothirds of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of China the highest ever proportion since Pew started asking the question in 2005 And a poll   Tuesday by the Center for Public Integrity and Ipsos showed about 3 in 10 Americans in the poll sample blaming China or Chinese people for the pandemic  University of California San Diego professor of political economy Victor Shih told USA TODAY the criticism of China follows a broader negative trend towards China in American politics  Things already were trending in a negative direction even before the coronavirus Shih said noting the ongoing trade war between the United States and China but the ongoing Chinabashing was doing real harm to the status of Asian Americans overall but especially Americans of Chinese descent  Pew Research Associate Kat Devlin told USA TODAY it was just within the last two years that Pew had witnessed such a negative change in its data lining up with the ratcheting up of rhetoric about the trade war between the two countries  Devlin noted that a partisan shift had happened in their data too In the past Republicans had expressed more negative views of China but in the last two years were now seeing majorities of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic also holding these unfavorable views The attacks from both the Trump and Biden campaigns have not been without some criticism  Trumps ad includes an image of former Washington Gov Gary Locke who is Chinese American prompting criticism of the Trump campaign Locke   the Trump campaign of fanning hatred and the Biden campaign called for the ad to be taken down   Bidens ad received positive reviews from   who praised Biden for punching back  But others particularly from the progressive left and some Asian American groups disagreed with the Biden campaigns messaging and the focus on China from both campaigns    responded to the Biden ad on Twitter saying Biden was trying to outTrump Trump  Christine Chen executive director of Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote called the Biden ad a misstep and the Trump ad irresponsible for including Locke   I understand the instinct for a campaign to respond directly to an opposing campaigns ad Chen said and while I do not believe the Biden campaign meant to be xenophobic the ad was still a misstep  Rep Judy Chu  DCalif the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus told USA TODAY there was space for a conversation criticizing the Chinese Communist Party but making China as a whole a centerpiece of a political campaign and doing so in a way that blames China for our problems is only going to encourage more anger and xenophobia at a time when both are dangerously high  I encourage all parties to refrain from antiChina broadsides that put Asian Americans in harm’s way she said "},
{"2405": "The captain of an aircraft carrier is asking the US Navy to step in to evacuate and isolate its crew as cases of the   have broken out among members In a fourpage letter dated Monday and first obtained by the   Navy Captain Brett Crozier of the USS Theodore Roosevelt said that decisive action was required to prevent deaths from the coronavirus and that the sailors on board were currently unable to comply with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to keep them safe because of the ships close quarters Crozier wrote that we are not at war and therefore cannot allow a single Sailor to perish as a result of this pandemic unnecessarily Coronavirus cases were first reported on the ship last week and continued to grow prompting the Navy to announce it would conduct testing on all of the approximately 5000 sailors aboard  The Navy  March 24 that three sailors had tested positive and been airlifted to a hospital in the Pacific Five more sailors were diagnosed Wednesday and by Thursday that number had jumped to 23 sailors according to a Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly We expect additional positive tests and those sailors who test positive will be transported to the US Naval Hospital Guam for further evaluation and treatment as necessary Adm Michael Gilday chief of naval operations said in a statement last week in response to the reported cases Gilday made clear the Roosevelt remained capable of its missions We are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region Gilday said last week  But Crozier stressed that there was an inordinate focus on testing for the virus which he noted cannot stop its spread and that more should be done to prevent the outbreak instead Because of the ships conditions Crozier said all sailors on board must be considered to have come in close contact with the virus and should be individually isolated Crozier said in his letter that only a fraction of the crew had been taken off the ship and that a group of sailors whose coronavirus tests initially did not return positive displayed symptoms within the next three days The letter outlines the conditions on the ship that facilitate the spread of the virus including the high number of sailors in a small space shared restrooms meals prepared and served by exposed personnel and tasks that require close contact He wrote that the sailors needed to be placed in isolation for 14 days to prevent the spread of the coronavirus  Due to a warships inherent limitations of space we are not doing this The spread of the disease is ongoing and accelerating Crozier said Citing an anonymous senior officer on board the Chronicle reported that the number of positive coronavirus cases on the ship is now between 150 and 200 Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly told   on Tuesday that we dont disagree with Crozier and that the Navy is taking all the appropriate steps I heard about the letter from Capt Crozier this morning I know that our command organization has been aware or this for about 24 hours and we have been working actually the last seven days to move those sailors off the ship and get them into accommodations in Guam Modly said noting that bed space was an issue A source who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY that the Navy is moving quickly to ensure the health and safety of the crew of the Roosevelt and is pursuing options to address the commanding officer’s concerns In a phone call with reporters Tuesday Adm John Aquilino Pacific Fleet commander would not confirm the number of cases among sailors but said the top priority is keeping them and their families safe None of the sailors are seriously ill he said and the Navy is working with local officials in Guam to secure hotel rooms for isolation The challenge for the Navy is how to balance that priority with the need to maintain readiness for warfighting should a crisis situation occur Aquilino said the number of sailors required to maintain operations would remain on the ship and others would be rotated through 14 days of isolation then retested before putting only healthy ones back on the ship Crozier requested that about 90 of the thousands of individuals aboard be moved ashore to isolate while 10 remain to operate and sanitize the ship We understand the request we’ve been working it in advance We continue to work it and I’m optimistic that the additional quarantine and isolation capacity that is being discussed will be delivered shortly Aquilino said but declined to answer questions about specific numbers remaining on board and being rotated out Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed US nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure Crozier wrote Keeping over 4000 young men and women on board the TR is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those Sailors entrusted to our care This will require a political solution but it is the right thing to do We are not at war Sailors do not need to die Crozier said Aquilino said he and the ships captain are on the same page but that Croziers disagreement  Croziers disagreement or his concern is associated with the pace that we get sailors off not that were not going to get sailors off"},

double maybe even triple testing in Ohio virtually overnight” said DeWine who called on the FDA to “prioritize companies that are putting a slightly different formula together for the extraction

three weeks out the Trump campaign is scrambling to find a fresh option for what will probably be the mostwatched speech of Trumps reelection campaign Though the White House grounds have emerged as a favorite advisers are considering historic sites in battleground states mirroring an event on July 3 when Trump spoke at   according to aides familiar with the planning Trump said in a tweet Monday that he had winnowed the list to the White House and Gettysburg  We have narrowed the Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech to be delivered on the final night of the Convention Thursday to two locations  The Great Battlefield of Gettysburg Pennsylvania and the White House Washington DC We will announce the decision soon Trump posted  Republican strategist Scott Jennings said the COVID19 pandemic has created problems for every event planner and the presidents reelection campaign is no exception A lot of things have been thrown into chaos so Im sympathetic he said Trump promoted the virtues of the White House during an interview Wednesday on Fox  Friends saying he would probably deliver the speech there noting that the venue would be the easiest and leastexpensive option Trump said he was not locked in on that choice  I think it would be a very convenient location it would be by far the least expensive Trump told a news conference Wednesday It would be very costconscious by comparison to any other location   Trump is pushing for a big event for his acceptance speech Aug 27 He said Wednesday that other speeches including by first lady Melania Trump would be delivered from different locations  In weeks of meetings aides said advisers have tossed around a number of possible backdrops – the Liberty Bell Gettysburg the Gateway Arch in St Louis a military facility – that could provide dramatic television pictures for Trumps speech They have talked about a prominent battleground state such as Florida or Pennsylvania Though some advisers are wary of Trump holding his speech in a city with a Democratic mayor such as Philadelphia all of the potential sites outside the White House are shadowed by a familiar problem COVID19 Many states have restrictions on crowd sizes and are wary of big events so aides are looking for a unique way to present Trumps speech Trump hasnt held a rally since his event in which drew a lowerthanexpected turnout and fueled controversy

presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is separate from the scaledback convention    Democrats who announced months ago that most of their convention will be virtual faced similar logistical challenges   that he scrapped plans to travel to Milwaukee to accept his partys nomination and will deliver his speech from his home in Delaware Because of COVID19 restrictions in North Carolina a

the convention Aug 24 the day of the nomination vote but only to greet the delegates and thank them for their work officials said Officials close to the president are interested in recapturing the energy they felt the president gained from the Mount Rushmore speech last month a Republican with knowledge of the planning said on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal details One option that has been discussed is Gettysburg Pennsylvania site of a famed Civil War battle as well as the speech by President Abraham Lincoln honoring the dead and sanctifying the Union causes Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania in 2016 polls show Biden with a singledigit lead there  Aides plan surprises for the week leading up to Trumps speech including speeches from prominent Republicans such as Melania Trump Though she enjoys support within the GOP the first lady has rarely appeared on the campaign trail on her own or alongside the president    If nothing works Trump retains the reserve option the White House It wouldnt be a first In 1940 President Franklin Roosevelt delivered a speech via radio to the Democratic convention that nominated him for an unprecedented third term Some ethics groups might object to the idea of using the White House for such a political event The Hatch Act forbids government officials from engaging in political activity on government property though the president is exempt from that law The White House is considered a residence rather than an office building Jordan Libowitz communications director for the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said Giving a political speech of this magnitude and visibility on the White House grounds creates the appearance that its a governmentsanctioned event something multiple laws were written to avoid Though the Hatch Act does not apply to the president Libowitz noted that other government employees would likely be necessary to handle the event  He added While many ethics laws like the Hatch Act do not apply to the president they could apply to the other government employees who might be attending or working on the event Trump dismissed those concerns Wednesday Some administration and campaign aides have questions about a White House acceptance speech Could aides who work for the government legally plan and set up such an event Or would campaign officials have to do that In addition to the closely watched convention speech aides plan ways to satisfy Trumps eagerness to get back out on the campaign trail One likely way is an alternative form of the rallies the president enjoys so much to be held at airports with a limited number of boisterous supporters Trump and his team roadtested the airport rally format last week in Tampa Florida where the president accepted an endorsement from the Florida Police Benevolent Association At Tampa Bay International Airport a few hundred supporters – appropriately spaced out but few wearing masks – greeted Air Force

planned     and   President Donald Trump supported protesters Sunday saying that “some governors have gone too far” without naming them “I have never seen so many American flags at a rally as I have at these rallies” Trump said during a daily news conference “They want to get back to work” But   on Sunday that protests were largely in states with Democratic governors that shouldn’t be exaggerated “But I think of it largely as a distraction and the president’s embrace of it as a distraction from the fact that he has not appropriately done testing treatment contact tracing and quarantine” Pelosi said Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said protesting stayathome orders could backfire if easing restrictions leads to the spread of more illness “If you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike you’re going to set yourself back” Fauci told ABC News on Monday “So as painful as it is to go by the careful guidelines of gradually phasing into a reopening – it’s going to backfire That’s the problem” In Tennessee Gov Lee announced Monday that the “vast majority” of businesses in 89 counties would be allowed to reopen May 1 but that he would work with business leaders and health officials six metropolitan counties to develop reopening strategies “While I am not extending the safer at home order past the end of

{"2862": "Senate Republicans are on the defensive as dissatisfaction with President Donald Trumps handling of the coronavirus pandemic puts them   in the Nov 3 election That presents them with a crucial strategy decision Do they inch away from Trump and risk alienating his fervent supporters who are at the core of the party Or do they maintain a united front that could make it harder for them to win over more moderate voters who are souring on the president Seven months ago congressional Republicans gave Trump a bulwark of support during his impeachment trial with all but one of them — Sen Mitt Romney of Utah — voting to acquit More recently GOP senators have shown some willingness to push back on the president but they are doing so selectively – on issues such as mask wearing and the trustworthiness of mailin voting – and most of them studiously avoid direct criticism that could trigger his wrath Sen John Thune of South Dakota the No 2 Republican in the Senate has contradicted the presidents claim that mailin voting will lead to widespread fraud Thune said the practice has been used in a lot of places for a long time and is secure Thune and John Cornyn a Texas Republican running for reelection were among several lawmakers who expressed wariness this week about Trumps idea of holding his formal GOP nomination speech at the White House – a break from decades of holding such events off the premises Yet Republicans are keenly aware that Trumps loyal political base is essential to retaining their 5347 majority in the Senate Turning against the president in swing states such as Colorado Maine North Carolina or Arizona is foolish GOP strategists said If they do that it will be suicide for the Republicans said John Feehery a former top congressional aide If you are seen as turning your back on the president a Trump voter will turn their back on you and you will lose the election On the other hand there has been anxiety within the GOP lately as Democratic presidential candidate Joe   I think the president’s combative style has appealed more to rural and exurban voters who are suspicious of the establishment David Kochel a former chief strategist for Jeb Bushs 2016 presidential campaign told USA Today  He has more support among noncollege voters than past GOP candidates but there is no question he has had a more difficult time with collegeeducated suburban voters as evidenced by the midterm elections Trumps handling of the coronavirus pandemic is a dominant theme in an election year when he and Republicans had hoped to run on the message of a strong economy Instead job losses and business closures caused by the pandemic have stolen away the presidents most effective reelection argument to upscale voters Kochel said This summers resurgence in COVID19 cases has given some GOP senators another reason to keep their distance In late May   and chided a reporter who wore one to a Rose Garden news conference suggesting the journalist was doing so to be politically correct The president rarely wears a face covering in public While some Republican lawmakers also forgo masks many others do the opposite and urge their constituents to follow federal health guidelines In June when the White House decided to pull back on federally supported testing sites some Republican senators up for reelection questioned the logic “Frankly I didn’t really understand what they were thinking    … At a time cases are spiking we’re gonna pull back When the White House took aim at Dr Anthony Fauci by trotting out a series of talking points against him Republican Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina   We dont have a Dr Fauci problem Graham who narrowly leads his Democratic challenger in recent polls told reporters We need to be focusing on doing things that get us to where we need to go So I have all the respect in the world for Dr Fauci I think any effort to undermine him is not going to be productive frankly Even on the culture wars the Republicancontrolled Senate parted ways with Trump this summer when it easily passed a defensive bill calling for the   Trump had threatened a veto but ultimately backed down Republican pollster Whit Ayers said this is part of a more subtle signaling to certain voters that will continue during the 2020 election cycle The Republican Senate candidates in swing states are going to need to emphasize their own independent contributions to their state and talk about how they are better than the Democratic nominee to represent the values of their state he said Most GOP senators running for reelection in 2016 outperformed thencandidate Trump in their respective states So when an old video of the real estate mogul bragging about groping women was released only weeks before the election it was easier for the handful of incumbents who did rebuke him to do so While in office the president has maintained a tight grip on the party in part because of his willingness to use his platform on Twitter to attack those he sees as disloyal but also because of his popularity with the base Nine of 10 Republicans approve of the job the president is doing a number that has stayed relatively constant during his tenure   And yet there are some disagreements Just last week Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans   Meanwhile Trump has faded from some Senate Republican campaign ads as COVID19 cases and deaths have begun to spike again Theres not been a lot of overt distancing because the necessity to win all the Trump voters limits the amount of distancing that a Republican Senate candidate can achieve Ayres the pollster said The pushback from GOP senators is rare enough that even Trump seems surprised when it happens A reporter asked the president Wednesday about Sen Thunes concerns about the legality of holding his acceptance speech at the White House John Thune did right Trump responded The Republican John Thune Well Okay Democrats meanwhile want voters to judge Senate Republicans and Trump as a pair Republican incumbents are at risk because of their own toxic records in Washington and refusing to hold the president accountable is another example of that failure Stewart Boss spokesman for the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee said  Their glowing praise for Trumps inept response to this public health and economic crisis shows they aren’t listening to voters and are unwilling to be independent voices for their states” A   conducted in June found twothirds of suburban women said they did not approve of Trumps overall job performance including 58 who strongly disapprove But such polls have not scared off Republicans such as Sen Thom Tillis The North Carolinians campaign made clear to the Associated Press in June that he is looking forward to campaigning with Trump  A recent poll by Morning Consult showed Tillis who has had trouble with the conservative base in the past trailing Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham by 7 percentage points What may be more telling however is that he lags behind Trump by 10 points when their respective reelection contests are compared Republican Sen Cory Gardner of Colorado trails Democratic challenger John Hickenlooper by 6 percentage points in the same Morning Consult survey But he slightly outpaces Trump by about 3 points Last month Gardner joined Ivanka Trump the presidents daughter and senior adviser at a childcare event in The Centennial State Instead of repudiation GOP candidates have chosen a more subtle approach that emphasizes bipartisan cooperation or their leadership on state issues It is normal for US Senate candidates to run on their own records and the voters expect you to do so Brad Todd a Republican media consultant told USA Today They cant make their own weather but they can make their own sails Todd said that means GOP campaigns have accepted that the national dynamic around Trump COVID19 and countrys economy is already known to most voters He said rather than alienating the presidents core base Republican Senate campaigns must seek to build off of the existing coalition What I would call regular Republicans Trumponly voters who are marginal and dont turn out very often and mostly suburban swing voters who tend to be rightofcenter on policy but not always crazy about the presidents methods Todd said Republican campaign officials working across multiple states say their emphasis is on winning over persuadable voters by drawing a contrast with Democrats on the economy  The National Republican Senatorial Committee the GOPs Senate campaign arm previewed its upcoming ad blitz in several races including North Carolina A memo from the committee highlighted plans to bombard Tillis Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham for what it says is his coziness with the farleft This race will not be easy and Tillis has ground to make up but Tillis has already shown he’s ready for this fight and his record of leadership is a stark contrast to Cunningham’s the NRSC memo said The document noted how Democrats have a favorable map and have spent more than 200 million in this cycle Despite that and an incredibly favorable environment the race for the Senate majority is still dead even the NRSC memo said That is a testament to the strength of our candidates One name never mentioned in the memo Trump whom the NRSC instructed candidates not to defend earlier this year at the outset of the coronavirus outbreak But even subtle distancing from Trump is unlikely to go much further than it has some analysts said In 1996 Republican nominee Bob Dole was trailing Democratic President Bill Clinton by double digits GOP operatives began to trot out a late message that assumed Clinton would win and instead stressed how voters should care about the congressional election outcome That did not make the Dole campaign happy at all but they nevertheless tried to separate themselves from Bob Dole in

{"1775": "I’m convinced that in a former life President Donald Trump was a brilliant defense attorney Getting him to give a direct answer to a question is like trying to nail a JellO mold to a wall This has enabled Trump to turn his pandemic updates into daily propaganda showcases Trump can stand in front of reporters for hours at a time appearing to answer questions but instead spinning a tale in which he emerges as a savior while the country is burning  Since my overthecounter antacids are no match for a Trump news conference I typically get most of my news from online newspapers But in preparation for this column I committed to watching the presidents Friday and Monday briefings   Sometimes Trump is asked one question and answers as if he had been asked a completely different question Sometimes Trump ignores the question altogether and responds with a web of exaggerated selfpraise And sometimes Trump simply lies  Maybe I miss crossexamining squirrelly witnesses who are trying to escape their own misdeeds Or maybe a month of stayathome compliance has exacerbated my obsessive compulsive disorder Either way I’ve been jotting down a list of times Trump evaded a reporter’s question along with my backseat driver’s crossexamination suggestions on how to push him back onto the track The list is longer than a CVS drugstore receipt but here are a few  What authority do you have to reopen right now The same way that it’s up to the states to shut it down it’s up to them to reopen What authority do you have      I have absolute authority to use it  Would I do it if I saw a state that was out of control and they didn’t have the stayathome policy I would do it in a heartbeat  Mr President I’m not asking whether you have the authority to shut down states Heres my question — Do you believe you have the authority to reopen states over the objection of governors      Then why did Patricia Kane the executive director of the New York State Nurses Association say   And why are there photos of nurses at New York Mount Sinai West hospital wearing   because they don’t have personal protective equipment  The governors have said — last night they had a group of governors 14 governors They were together someplace and they said It’s been unbelievable what’s happened    Mr President could you tell me which 14 governors you’re referring to who said that they have all the ventilators and personal protective equipment they need  And could you please tell me where this meeting of 14 governors occurred last night  If your medical experts come back to you sir and say before May the 1st   do you listen  I will certainly listen  Will you take that advice There are two sides  I will listen to them very carefully though  Listening to them is not the same as following their recommendation Will you commit to keeping the stayathome guidelines in place past May 1 if that’s what your medical experts advise   On March 6th you said anyone who wants a test can get a test Now you’re saying that there — that you would be open to reopening the government without having a national testing system  There’s still issues with testing going forward      Vast areas of our country don’t need this  You don’t have to test every single person in Iowa to say Let’s open up and let’s get the tractors moving and let’s get the corn  I’m not suggesting you send tests where theyre not needed I’m asking why places like New York California Louisiana and Detroit have leaders saying they don’t have sufficient tests I’m also asking for a specific date by which the federal government can ensure these places will have the tests they need  Today you tweeted The Invisible Enemy will soon be in full retreat Given it’s invisible without widespread testing how would you know  At a certain point in the nottoodistant future it will be gone …Youre going to see nobodys getting sick anymore It will be gone and it wont be that much longer  Mr President I’m sure everyone appreciates your optimism but that is a big promise Specifically when do you estimate this will happen A month Three months By the end of the year Do Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx agree  Is there a priority to get testing at foodprocessing plants all across the country  Well you’re asking that because of    This is very complex This is a very brilliant enemy You know it’s a brilliant enemy They develop drugs like the antibiotics You see it Antibiotics used to solve every problem Now one of the biggest problems the world has is the germ has gotten so brilliant that the antibiotic can’t keep up with it  Mr President are you aware that antibiotics have no effect on a disease like COVID19 More to the point will you commit to ensuring that in the next seven days all food processing plants have testing available for their employees to ensure our food chain is safe for Americans   You didn’t close down the country   Should you have closed it down earlier  I closed down from China  It’s not about January  Excuse me I closed it down from China And by the way some people think I should have waited longer and maybe ridden it out  You limited travel   but didn’t issue stayathome guidelines   Those are the 45 days when the virus spread across this country Those are the 45 days that could have saved tens of thousands of American lives Why didn’t you issue those guidelines earlier   I have immense respect for the journalists who unearth the endless well of negligence and corruption that come from an administration careening out of control But Donald Trump is the presidential equivalent of Harry Houdini He has an innate ability to escape the chains of truth that should hold him in the spotlight long enough to reveal the emperor has no clothes On Monday Paula Reid of CBS News gave the president a run for his money with a series of   about the administrations delay in responding to the pandemic We need more of that Going forward journalists must consider that capturing a shape shifter in his true form is tough The only way to do it is through pressure — lots of pressure"},

Tuesday that the state is looking at 15 to 20 sites including Memorial Hospital Care New England’s CEO Dr James Fanale said his organization is working with the state to figure out the best geographic locations for coronavirus care sites Care New England closed Memorial in 2017 citing low patient counts and steep financial losses As businesses considered nonessential close statewide to fight the coronavirus health officials are coming under increased scrutiny over information the state isn’t gathering or releasing about the spread of the virus For a brief time last week the Department of Health and Environmental Control released the number of COVID19 cases in each ZIP code But less than a day later officials replaced it with a simple listing of each ZIP code with at least a case State health officials also are not tracking how many health care workers are infected and have been reluctant to share the addresses of known cases with emergency dispatchers Local authorities want that information to better protect first responders and conserve protective gear in short supply DHEC officials say eventually it all comes back to their desire to get the public to understand that for every diagnosed COVID19 case a shortage of tests means there are a lot of people with the virus undiagnosed and so people need to act like anyone they encounter is infected and protect themselves “There are unrecognized cases everywhere” State Epidemiologist Dr Linda Bell said Gov Kristi Noem on Tuesday signed nine emergency bills passed by the Legislature to address the outbreak of the coronavirus Lawmakers passed the bills just hours before Noem’s signing They met in a marathon session that stretched from Monday into Tuesday voting remotely through a conference call system The measures make a slew of changes like postponing local elections from midApril until June waiving state requirements on schools due to the coronavirus and adjusting the state budget to distribute 93  Officials want tourism businesses to stop soliciting tourists in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus The mayors of five cities in Sevier County urged leisure businesses to halt guests through midApril the Sevierville Police Department said in a post on Facebook WBIRTV reports that just a few weeks ago tourists packed Sevier County even after some big attractions closed down and the public

part of a group trip to Mexico that had not been canceled by the travel company A woman who was in hospice care in a longterm facility became the fifth person to die in the state after contracting the coronavirus health officials said Tuesday The woman died in the WeberMorgan County area and no one else has tested positive in connection with her state epidemiologist Angela Dunn said Authorities said she was younger than 60 Meanwhile a case of the virus reported in central Utah means there’s at least one in every health district statewide Dunn said Nearly 900 people in Utah have the virus

and prescription drugs to stop the sale of nonessential products Whenever possible stores such as Walmart Target and Costco must stop the sale of nonessential items and require online or telephone ordering delivery and curbside pickup “Large ‘big box’ retailers generate significant shopping traffic by virtue of their size and the variety of goods offered in a single location” Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary Lindsay Kurrle said Tuesday “This volume of shopping traffic significantly increases the risk of further spread of this dangerous virus to Vermonters and the viability of Vermont’s health care system” Among the items that cannot be sold in person include clothing consumer electronics books furniture and sporting equipment The Virginia Department of Corrections announced late Tuesday that three offenders had tested positive for COVID19 marking the first confirmed cases among inmates in a state correctional facility The inmates are incarcerated at the Virginia Correctional Center for Women in Goochland the department said in a statement Three employees and one contractor have also tested positive the department said One of those employees works as a correctional officer at Indian Creek Correctional Center in Chesapeake and one employee works in the Norfolk Probation and Parole office according to the statement The other two work at the Goochland facility one as an officer in training and one as a contract nurse the department said All corrections facilities “are operating on modified lockdown in order to minimize contact between groups of offenders from different buildings” the statement said Officials said 130 Washington National Guardsmen were preparing Wednesday to support food banks across the state including in King Pierce Chelan and Franklin counties Karina Shagren a spokeswoman for the Washington Military Department said the hope is to have soldiers and airmen in place starting Friday and that they will be used to fill critical staffing needs Shagren said many food banks are operated by volunteers who fall into the atrisk categories so members of the National Guard will ensure food banks have the personnel necessary to keep them up and running and ensure they’re able to continue to provide food to those who need it Meanwhile UW Medicine which runs Harborview Medical Center and hospitals and clinics around Seattle has announced changes to its mask policy after employees objected to its directive that disallowed or discouraged health care workers from using surgical masks when they were not interacting with coronavirus patients Gov Jim Justice on Tuesday acknowledged that his directive to have police monitor roads and check in on travelers from coronavirus hotspots might be unconstitutional but he said it will continue for safety reasons Justice has issued an executive order mandating that people entering the state from places hardhit by the virus must quarantine for two weeks or face an obstruction charge saying authorities will watch roads and conduct home checks to make sure people comply “If they don’t quarantine themselves for 14 days you know I’m going to take a big time issue with it and I may lose at the end of the day but I’m going to try to protect our people” Justice a Republican said in response to a question about the legality of the directives The instruction triggered constitutional concerns almost immediately with the leader of the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia saying the order was overly broad and could violate constitutional rights on unreasonable searches and seizures Gov Tony Evers released another package of proposals to address the coronavirus pandemic Wednesday as a new poll showed broad support for the actions he’s taken already to close schools and businesses and limit gatherings to slow the spread of the disease The Marquette University Law School poll showing Evers with 76 support for his handling of the pandemic so far came just after Republican leaders criticized his administration for not presenting more data including how many people have been hospitalized with COVID19 Shortly after their comments the state Department of Health Services reported for the first time that 26 of confirmed COVID19 patients had been hospitalized Republicans and Evers were working toward an agreement that could be voted on by the Legislature as soon as next week Republican leaders said they had agreed to temporarily waive a oneweek waiting period for unemployment benefits something Evers had pushed for The Legislature will likely hold its first special session in more than 15 years to allocate emergency federal funding to address the coronavirus pandemic and possibly other matters

{"1102": "Dr Robert Redfield called Nevada’s chief medical officer on a Saturday night in early March with an extraordinary request  Adam Laxalt the former attorney general of Nevada until 2019 and booster for President Donald Trump believed he was exposed to the coronavirus while attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland But he was not showing symptoms and could not get approved for a test through a local hospital back home according to interviews and internal communications USA TODAY received through records requests On the phone call Redfield asked the medical officer Dr Ihsan Azzam to get it done Azzam who had never met or spoken with Redfield before was stunned At the time testing capacity around the country was scarce and people without symptoms often were not a priority  “It wasn’t the protocol” Azzam told USA TODAY in an interview “This is a VIP person We got a call from the CDC director who is advising that we test him for COVID19”  The next morning Azzam contacted the county health department in Reno and fasttracked Laxalt’s test Redfield called back hours later to thank him Azzam said The special treatment is a stark example of how political influence has penetrated the CDC during the COVID19 pandemic creating challenges for local health authorities It came at a time when his agency knew thousands of Americans needed testing but could not get it due to supply shortages Redfield’s intervention on Laxalt’s behalf also sheds light on how some of those with powerful connections — including celebrities and star athletes — have received preferential care since the beginning of the crisis “That’s privilege” Richard Whitley director of the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services told USA TODAY Whitley also acknowledged that there may have been added confusion at the hospital originally over whether or not Laxalt was requesting a test for COVID19 or the flu Laxalt who is the Trump campaigns Nevada cochair responded in an email “After CPAC it was clear I met the criteria for testing I wanted to make sure I wasn’t a risk to my community I obtained a rapid test and result Fortunately I tested negative” After publication Laxalt told USA TODAY in an email that he was feeling ill at the time and a test was warranted He   in which his physician stated he believed Laxalt met the criteria to receive a test because he had been exposed and showed upper respiratory symptoms Testing at that time was difficult as testing capacity in our region was still limited his doctor wrote White House spokesman Judd Deere told USA TODAY in an email that the White House “was not involved” in arranging the test for Laxalt He referred reporters to the CDC which did not immediately respond to requests for comment Earlier this week USA TODAY  trying to fight the virus on the ground Redfield has been criticized for capitulating to White House political pressure and failing to stand up for the scientists inside his agency For instance White House officials have been screening the CDC’s weekly coronavirus reports and   Sen Patty Murray DWashington questioned Redfield about concerns of politics coloring the agency’s public health activities at a hearing this week of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee “Why have you not done more to push back on President Trumps political interference and his efforts to downplay this” Murray asked Redfield said the agency’s science had not been compromised and would never be on his watch  “Were going to continue to give Congress and the nation the best public health advice” he said “Were not going to let political influence try to modulate that” Redfield   that a vaccine may not be widely available until next year and even then wearing a face mask could offer more protection Trump later in the day disputed those remarks at a White House news conference saying he had called the CDC director and thought his remarks were mistaken  The  as the CDC issued a statement withdrawing Redfield’s claims on the vaccine timeline before retracting the withdrawal an hour later  At the time of CPAC held Feb 2629 at a resort in National Harbor Maryland Trump Redfield and much of the GOP establishment were still publicly downplaying the coronavirus threat But the first cases of community spread were emerging which told CDC officials that the virus was circulating across America the agency would later acknowledge   Last week journalist Bob Woodward disclosed that President Donald Trump told him in early February that his administration knew by then that the virus was spreading through the air and killing people at a higher rate than the flu but Trump publicly minimized the risks The weekend after the Maryland conference the American Conservative Union announced that one of the attendees had tested positive for COVID19 Trump and Vice President Mike Pence both spoke at the event where Laxalt posed for photos with Donald Trump Jr Sen Josh Hawley and Rep Kevin McCarthy currently the GOP house leader  In Nevada state health officials were incensed that Redfield had circumvented the public health system and diverted resources to help a wellconnected politician Laxalt is the grandson of the late Paul Laxalt Nevada’s former Republican governor US senator and a close friend of President Ronald Reagan  The state has trended increasingly Democratic in recent years but still could be competitive in the November election Trump held a campaign rally near Reno and other Nevada locations last weekend Campaign aides scrambled to find venues for the events after local officials blocked their initial plans because they would have violated coronavirus health safety guidelines  Laxalts test raised other concerns back in March Because he and the CDC had not gone through the typical reporting structure before he was tested local officials in Reno did not immediately know about his exposure They could not immediately trace for more possible exposures or issue a quarantine  “They would have minimized further exposure” Nevada state epidemiologist Melissa PeekBullock told USA TODAY “That’s what we were trying to do to prevent spreading We had no opportunity to intervene” Testing capacity in the US for the coronavirus remained limited in March after the CDC had botched the rollout of the initial test the month before While Trump and federal officials were claiming that testing was widely available supplies were so limited that local and state health officials still influenced where resources went In Nevada anyone referred by a doctor was still being interviewed by health officials to determine if his or her situation was urgent enough to warrant testing PeekBullock said On March 7 the day Redfield called Azzam there were between 300 and 600 confirmed positive cases nationwide There were two in Nevada By then Maryland had three confirmed cases On March 12 Whitley the state health director   Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar to tell him what had happened The documents which USA TODAY received via a public records request do not disclose Laxalts identity “The lack of appropriate communication has delayed the public health response in order to stop further transmission of COVID19 in our state” Whitley wrote adding that CDC’s backdoor maneuvers “resulted in both frustration and inefficient use of our limited public health resources”  Azar did not respond  Two weeks later Laxalt penned an oped in the Reno Gazette Journal part of the USA TODAY Network about Trump’s response to the pandemic  “I cannot stress enough” Laxalt wrote “how fortunate we are that the Trump administration has proven time and again it will always have the Silver State’s back”"},
