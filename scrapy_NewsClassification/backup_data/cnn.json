needed help White House officials and others close to the President describe a distinct shift in Trumps demeanor and   over the past 48 hours a stretch that saw markets tumble the US case count top 1200 and  On Wednesday morning he began pushing for an Oval Office address though aides working on the coronavirus response hadnt had one on their radar Advisers debated the wisdom of doing so believing it could lend urgency and weight to one of the most precarious moments of Trumps presidency  The President told reporters during a meeting with bankers he would likely deliver a statement at 8 pm ET on Wednesday but didnt offer specifics Later he  Even as aides say Trump appears to be taking the pandemic and its economic ramifications more seriously he has continued to publicly downplay the health crisis and contradict federal public health officials His primetime address on Wednesday will be a major test of his willingness to finally meet the seriousness of the moment Trumps focus remains on the economic ramifications of the outbreak which are worsening by the day Some close to the President still believe he hasnt fully grasped the gravity of the health situation itself and remains in denial over whats unfolding across the nation And several people who have urged the President to take a more serious approach  and stop brushing off sobering warnings from his own health officials  said his recent unease stems more from negative coverage than a sudden reckoning about the outbreak But as the President returned to the White House on Monday afternoon from a weekend spent in Florida some aides described a new mandate that more needed to be done to contain economic fallout from a crisis hes repeatedly sought to minimize The gravity of the moment was pretty clear a senior White House official said In another sign of movement Jared Kushner Trumps soninlaw and senior adviser has become more involved in the last few days He has joined the President for several meetings on the topic and huddled with other top advisers about the administrations response a White House official and other sources familiar with the matter said One Trump ally said Kushner is becoming more involved because of concerns about how the administrations coronavirus task force  now headed by Vice President Mike Pence  is being run But there is also some quiet eyerolling among some Trump allies who point out it was Kushner who urged the President last month to downplay the situation when coronavirus concerns first caused selloffs on Wall Street Kushners new role also comes at a time when his power in the West Wing is at a premium Outgoing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has been diminished and the incoming chief of staff Mark Meadows is in selfquarantine and has yet to set foot inside the White House Kushners decision to take a role in the coronavirus efforts is just the latest example of the Presidents powerful soninlaw taking his seat at the table on the crisisofthemoment And it is the latest expansion of Kushners portfolio which has included everything from IsraeliPalestinian peace USMexico relations trade negotiations and prison and immigration revisions Some White House officials worry Trumps intense focus on the economic fallout of the coronavirus is distracting from efforts to limit the actual spread of the disease One person close to Trump said he is still willfully disregarding top lines from his briefings about how serious the spread is and how much worse it can get On Wednesday Trumps public meetings focused on the health of the economy including an afternoon session with the heads of large American banks It was a similar group of American executives who tried appealing to Trump in January that the emerging virus posed a potential threat to their businesses  and the American economy  People familiar with the discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos said the President met their concerns with the equivalent of a shrug insisting the virus was contained to China and would not pose a threat It was a very different conversation on Wednesday as Trump raised the prospect of new stimulus measures to contain further economic damage in the United States Still Trump seemed optimistic rather than fatalistic about the future If we get rid of the problem quickly everything solves itself he said Deep questions remain about the administrations ability to contain the actual spread of the virus and early missteps like a delay in distributing test kits are continuing to hamper response efforts Some of Trumps aides privately worry he spent too long downplaying the crisis and will have trouble pivoting Trump has repeatedly sought outside advice on the response to the coronavirus Aides are used to this and often try to head off what they regard as bad advice in advance While Trump continues to insist the media is overhyping the crisis and trying to harm him politically he has told advisers he wants take dramatic steps to help mitigate the economic fallout and try to reduce fears Ultimately it has required a steady parade of the Presidents allies and advisers to convince him the coronavirus outbreak presents an existential threat to his political prospects and will require major intervention by the federal government to eventually contain Trump spent the weekend at MaraLago stewing over the media and Democrats criticism of his handling of the coronavirus outbreak but the weekend also gave him a glimpse into his friends and allies own concerns about the financial impact of the viral outbreak During his stay at his private Florida club Trump was confronted by member after member who warned his response to the virus was being viewed as inadequate While few told Trump directly that he needed to take it more seriously the message was clear his appearance of nonchalance was playing poorly and would eventually threaten his presidency One weekend guest at the club Fox News host Tucker Carlson began his program on Monday with a blunt message that seemed aimed at his No 1 viewer In crisis its more important than ever to be calm Carlson said But staying calm is not the same as remaining complacent It does not mean assuring people that everything will be fine We dont know that Instead its better to tell the truth That is always the surest sign of strength Trump was also surprised when at least three Republican lawmakers with whom he enjoys close ties  Reps Matt Gaetz Doug Collins and Mark Meadows who he recently named his new chief of staff  entered selfquarantine after coming into contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus at a conservative gathering last month While Trump has not expressed worry about his personal health following those cases and has resisted being tested for the virus himself he privately appeared startled that people close to him were being so directly affected by the outbreak Trump remains in search of something big to buoy the economy He has focused on a payroll tax cut and the dual benefits he believes it carries helping the economy amid the current economic uncertainty and putting more money in Americans pockets through the November election a senior White House official said But even some of his top officials have opposed such a step and it received lukewarm reception on Capitol Hill after Trump floated it during an appearance in the White House briefing room on Monday Trumps team was caught off guard when he announced he was doing a news conference because they recognized it was unlikely he would have anything concrete to announce by the end of the next day Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Larry Kudlow urged a more targeted approach instead of a broad step such as a payroll tax cut but Trump stressed that he wanted economic action that would help businesses and families across the country A payroll tax cut  an idea he had picked up recently during a meeting with Sen Steve Daines  was at the top of the Presidents wish list While Kudlow and Mnuchin pushed back the President found support in other aides namely his pugnacious trade adviser Peter Navarro who egged Trump on to Kudlow and Mnuchins dismay Trump has repeatedly tried to include aides who are not on the coronavirus task force in the administrations response This has irked some officials who are formally on the response team After the meeting in the Oval Office Monday Trump designated Navarro to join the other economic advisers on stage during a press briefing Even as Trump has begun to recognize the seriousness of the situation he has struggled to shed the rosecolored glasses informing his public statements in favor of sober assessments about the worsening pandemic Were doing a great job with it And it will go away Just stay calm It will go away Trump said as he left a lunch with Senate Republicans on Tuesday The next day one of the governments top public health experts Dr Anthony Fauci stripped all flourish to deliver this assessment Bottom line its going to get worse Trump has not only continued to publicly downplay the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic but he has also focused most of his public remarks on defending himself from the perception that his administration has mishandled the outbreak With coronavirus cases spiking doctors complaining of slow and insufficient access to tests and disruptions to everyday life increasing daily Trump has chosen to repel those facts with attacks on the news media and Democrats in Congress Trump has repeatedly touted the great job his administration has done repeatedly attacked news coverage of coronavirus as fake news and focused on his administrations early move to cut off most travel from China rather than addressing the disturbing rise in coronavirus cases in the US today As you know its about 600 cases its about 26 deaths within our country And had we not acted quickly that number would have been substantially more Trump said Within 24 hours cases in the US surged past 1000"},

{"3047": "Trump also repeated his incorrect suggestion that he has the power to decide when governors lift their pandemicrelated restrictions And he argued that people should have told us about the virus omitting the fact that he continued to downplay the virus for weeks after public warnings   We fact checked these items below  As part of the administrations threephase recommendation for reopening the country Trump said some states could be ready to enter phase one of the reopening process as soon as Friday because when it comes to coronavirus you have states without any problem He added that some states are at a point where there is almost nothing in terms of coronavirus cases and that you have states with few cases and those few cases have healed  Wyoming which has the fewest cases of any state has reported 288 cases While Trump was hesitant to name which specific states could be the first to reopen none of them have close to zero cases according to the latest   from Johns Hopkins University Further testing issues have raised   that cases or deaths are being undercounted so its difficult to know the accuracy of the existing data   Trump has made similar false claims in past briefings In early April he   that certain states specifically those without stayathome orders were not in jeopardy or at risk from the coronavirus The number of coronavirus cases in all those states except Wyoming have since more than doubled though two of them  Wyoming and North Dakota  remain among the five states with the least amount of cases Trump said of state governors If they need to remain closed we will allow them to do that And if they believe it is time to reopen we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task and very very quickly depending on what they want to do  Trumps comment was similar to his  that he was authorizing the governors to lift their restrictions as they pleased Experts say that the governors have a longestablished constitutional authority over public health matters and do not need the Presidents permission to implement or maintain pandemicrelated closures  On Thursday Trump did not repeat his  that he has total authority over the state restrictions or his  that we have the right to do whatever we want But he was still implicitly suggesting that he has power he does not have  You can read a longer fact check on this subject    The President again expressed frustration that coronavirus warnings should have been told to us a lot sooner   I was angry because this should have been told to us It should have been told to us early It should have been told to us a lot sooner Trump said People knew it was happening and people didnt want to talk about it I dont know why But were going to get to the bottom of it  When pressed about whether he meant China Trump deflected Im not saying anything Im saying people should have told us about this They should have told the rest of the world too  For context One day after the World Health Organization   the coronavirus outbreak a   the Trump administration   who visited China from entering the country  But Trump   to downplay the seriousness of the disease likening it to the flu nearly a month later At the   on February 26 Trump made all of the following comments This is a flu This is like a flu Now you treat this like a flu Its a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for And well essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner  A   into the Trump administrations coronavirus response also   that Trump repeatedly ignored warnings from top health advisers about the spread of the lethal disease  You can read more about Trumps claims that it was unknown how contagious the coronavirus was   and more on Trumps false claim that the pandemic crisis was unforeseen    The President defended the countrys coronavirus testing capacity saying that a recent drop in the number of commercial lab tests was the result of new and better testing solutions come online     As these new and better testing solutions come online we are seeing this additional capacity reflected in the numbers For this reason the number of tests processed in commercial laboratories has dropped from approximately 100000 to roughly 75000 tests over the last week Trump said     He continued The reason it dropped it because we have so many other tests and we dont even have to go through the laboratories But the laboratories have tremendous additional capacity and states feel free to use that capacity        Between April 7 and 14 there were about 576000 newly completed tests reported by American Clinical Laboratory Association  which represents commercial labs such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics In the sevenday period before that from March 31 and April 7 there were about 673000 newly completed tests reported by ACLA member labs Those numbers represent an approximate 14 decrease in the newly completed tests performed by ACLA member labs     Social distancing has slowed the spread of the disease potentially resulting in fewer requests for tests The White House recently revised down projected coronavirus death totals and even hotspots like New York have   a flattening of the infection rate curve    Meanwhile in a statement on Wednesday the ACLA said testing capacity was not an issue Other groups however have reported problems In a Monday letter to the White House Coronavirus Task Force the Association of American Medical Colleges which represents medical schools and academic facilities said labs are facing critical shortages     The federal government   to the states new Abbott Laboratory testing devices that can quickly produce coronavirus test results in minutes But hamstringing efforts the devices were accompanied with only enough test kits to test around 115 people in each state    The precise reason for the weektoweek drop in testing at commercial labs is not clear and multiple factors could have contributed to the decline But ultimately the US is still short of the testing capacity needed before steps can be taken to reopen the economy and return to normalcy "},
{"6911": "This week as another   hes talking to the President in person Florida Gov Ron DeSantis traveled to Washington on Tuesday to meet with Trump in the Oval Office as the expiration of his state lockdown order nears on May 1 He said during the meeting he would unveil his reopening plans on Wednesday And he made sure to compliment the President and his handling of the crisis praise Trump returned in spades It was a meeting of two likeminded politicians who have both been criticized for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic The similarities were evident during a lengthy questionandanswer session in the Oval Office both lamented the coverage theyd received in the press and sought to project momentum on   despite persistent shortfalls As he has repeatedly over the past month Trump harkened back to his early decision to restrict some travel from China and Europe as evidence of how hed handled the crisis But DeSantis suggested those restrictions hadnt made a significant impact in Florida If you look at our outbreak not a lot of it is tied to that he said suggesting more cases were imported to Florida from other US states like New York Instead DeSantis said he had raised concerns about coronavirus infecting more individuals in the United States from Latin American travelers and that he would like to see those travelers receiving rapid tests before boarding their flights into the US Trump indicated his administration is working with airlines to conduct temperature checks and coronavirus tests on international passengers coming into the United States When the President raised the prospect of cutting off Brazil DeSantis suggested something more constrained Well not necessarily cut em off but its just if youre going to fly to Miami then the airlines should give you the Abbott test and then put you on the plane he said Would you ever want to ban certain countries Trump asked You let us know Trump has encouraged governors to be aggressive in their reopening plans telling state leaders in a conference call on Monday   Some governors have been less willing to loosen restrictions on businesses and gatherings as testing continues to lag and outbreaks persist DeSantis visiting a hospital in Tampa on Monday said the return to normal would be methodical slow and data driven  He repeated in the Oval Office that the first steps toward reopening would likely resemble the states current status For Florida going from where we are now to phase 1 is not a very big leap he said I think we will be able to be a small step for us We will approach it in a very measured thoughtful and datadriven way Thats what most of the folks throughout the state are looking for In the past DeSantis has taken his cues from the President who tweeted ahead of their Oval Office meeting Many States moving to SAFELY  QUICKLY reopen Once a holdout on issuing mandatory stayathome orders in Florida DeSantis cited Trumps own toneshift on coronavirus when he ultimately declared a lockdown at the start of April It is a very serious situation DeSantis said at the beginning of the month When you see the President up there and his demeanor the last couple of days thats not necessarily how he always is The Republican governor had come under harsh criticism for allowing spring breakers to crowd beaches and resorts as other states were entering mandatory shutdowns and restricting access to public spaces He defended his actions seated next to Trump on Tuesday taking another cue from the President in lashing out at the press Everyone in the media was saying Florida would be like New York or Italy and that has not happened he said We had a tailored and measured approach Trump and DeSantis have remained in close touch throughout the crisis They spoke at the start of the month as DeSantis was considering his statewide order And they were in contact as Trump contemplated slapping travel restrictions on New York and its neighbors DeSantis complained to the President that some people from that area were bringing coronavirus south to his state The personal relationship has appeared to help DeSantis secure from Trump badly needed personal protective equipment and other supplies even as other states struggled to have their requests fulfilled Trump said Tuesday he and DeSantis had consulted during the crisis about ventilator needs in Florida agreeing that the news media and certain Democratic governors were overplaying shortfalls DeSantis said hed conferred with Trumps soninlaw and senior adviser Jared Kushner on the issue and they agreed Florida didnt require additional shipments of ventilators from the federal government Trump has placed ample responsibility on individual governors for planning their own states reopening plans and on Monday unveiled a federal strategy than places much of the onus on states to scale up testing  a requirement health experts say to safely returning to normal But even as Trump issues Twitter declarations for states to liberate he has cautioned some governors that they are moving too quickly Last week after Georgia Gov Brian Kemp announced a plan allowing businesses like nail salons and bowling alleys to reopen Trump initially told him on a telephone call he supported the plan But after members of Trumps coronavirus task force  principally Dr Deborah Birx the White House coronavirus response coordinator  cautioned that Georgias reopening plans rebutted the federal guidelines Trump had unveiled a few day earlier he reversed course I told the governor of Georgia Brian Kemp that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities which are in violation of the phase one guidelines for the incredible people of Georgia Trump said during a news conference last week He suggested he would intervene if he saw something totally egregious DeSantis perhaps hoping to avoid a similar public intervention has been vague about his own plans for reopening He will receive recommendations from his own state task force and said Monday he would adopt a phased approach indicating the first moves toward reopening would amount to baby steps But many in Florida where tourism and hospitality represent major economic drivers are itching for a loosening of restrictions And Trump who himself is now a Florida resident is highly attuned to the states politics as his reelection nears Polls over the last month have shown former Vice President Joe Biden with a modest lead over Trump in the state though it remains a close race"},

{"7580": "The President gets regular briefings on agriculture sales to China and monitors those figures almost as closely as his White House pandemic team tracks statistics on the coronavirus which  by Saturday Publicly Trump is downplaying the importance of trade during the global pandemic Describing a Thursday night phone call with President Xi Jinping about the coronavirus the President said This whole invisible enemy has taken over the world Nobody cares about trade But behind closed doors White House officials say Trump continues to emphasize farm product sales to China even as he grapples with the most significant crisis of his presidency and a looming presidential campaign His focus on the issue reflects his increasing concern about protecting Americas economic health  a central plank in his reelection campaign  as well as public health It is also deepening the dissonance between the messages Trump and his most senior Cabinet officials are sending Trumps top trade negotiators had priorities that differed from the Presidents during trade talks with China prior to the signing of a Phase One deal in January several sources familiar with the discussions told CNN  Now while some administration officials blame Beijing for the coronavirus outbreak and after   the President has adopted a noticeably softer tone weighing criticism of the Communist Party against the importance of trade negotiations between the two countries    That link was on display last week during a coronavirus task force briefing when the President was asked whether Beijing bears responsibility for the outbreak that originated within its borders While Cabinet members like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have spoken of a coming time for recriminations Trump responded by talking about exports to China  I was told by our great secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue that Chinas been buying a lot of our farm product And Im looking at different pricing but China has despite all of this  been buying our agricultural product he told reporters Administrations officials say theres concern in the White House that the pandemic may lead China to back out of promises made in the Phase One trade deal   over two years  Chinese purchases of American pork corn and other products are crucial to farmers in traditionally Republican states the President wants to win in Novembers election  states where farmers have already been hit hard by Trumps tariffs on China Boosting agriculture sales is also key to Trumps campaign promises about shifting the trade deficit with China as well Trump has long been adamant about the need for China to buy US farm product frequently grilling his trade negotiators to ensure that happens  He has remained fixated on that issue even as the coronoavirus outbreak continues to spread across the US receiving regular updates from Perdue on how much China has been buying in the weeks since coronavirus reached US shores Two days before Trump referenced agriculture sales to China from the White House podium US exporters reported daily sales of 756000 tons of corn and 340000 tons of wheat to China The corn sales represent the highest weekly volume to China since 2011 and that data will be included in an April 2 report according to the Department of Agriculture   Those numbers which Agriculture Department officials say are   but are not considered a replacement for monthly data from the Commerce Department have reinforced Trumps view that preserving positive trade relations with China is a top priority   But pressing China to buy American farm products was not the top priority for US officials leading recent Phase One trade negotiations who instead focused on a number of other issues in their talks including theft of advanced technology copyright infringement and cyberspying During those discussions US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would frequently cover all the essentials of the deal then acknowledge later on that they had to throw in a mention of agriculture purchases simply so they could tell the President theyd done so according to several people familiar with the discussions Still the Trump administration has toiled over what to do about the agriculture purchases China committed to as part of the Phase One trade deal since the coronavirus outbreak reached US shores The President and several administration officials have raised the possibility that the implementation of certain elements of the Phase One deal will be delayed only increasing uncertainty around Chinas commitments to purchase US agriculture exports In the leadup to the Phase One deal China had been cautious saying that it would buy US agriculture products in accordance with market conditions and World Trade Organization restrictions  This raises the concern that China may renege if economic conditions dont support the purchases at target levels The agriculture purchases which hold significant political weight among many farmers in traditionally Republican states have therefore been viewed by some analysts as more of a campaign promise than an economic reality Yet Trump has continued to tout US sales of farm product to China as a metric of success and to signal that protecting trade relations with Beijing remains a priority amid increasing tensions between the two countries  The President has stuck to that strategy even as some of his closest allies including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo continue to charge that Beijing failed to identify stop or warn about the virus early on several sources said Trump has refrained from directly attacking his counterpart President Xi in an effort not to damage what he views as a close personal relationship that is key to any trade deal He has also pulled back on using the name China virus or Wuhan virus though Pompeo and others continue to do so The two leaders spoke by phone Thursday night for the first time since early February Both leaders reiterated their commitment to cooperate to protect lives and livelihoods The two leaders agreed to work together to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and restore global health and prosperity the White House said in a readout of the call Pompeo however has shown no sign of following suit and toning down his own rhetoric a rare instance in which the top US diplomat has appeared to publicly break with the President   A push by the US State Department to include the phrase Wuhan virus in a joint statement on coronavirus by Group of Seven foreign ministers on Wednesday was rejected resulting in separate statements and division in the group  In an interview with Fox News on Thursday night shortly before the call with Xi Trump again highlighted his administrations focus on trade with China and his desire to preserve positive relations with Beijing    We now have a great piece of the trade deal and now we will start phase two and that will be great and we are taking in billions and billions of dollars a year in tariffs and they are paying for it because they devalue their currency and other things So lets get along with China Trump said"},

{"8049": "Researchers at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health suggest the case tally in the US does not capture the total burden of the pandemic because testing has been primarily restricted to individuals with moderate to severe symptoms due to limited test availability  The report published in the journal   says the US may have experienced over 64 million cases of Covid19 by April 18 At the time there were 721245 confirmed cases the researchers said As of Wednesday more than 63 million coronavirus cases have been reported and 190763 people have died according to  We know that in the US earlier on in the epidemic the people who were getting tested had moderate to severe symptoms said Jade BenjaminChung one of the studys coauthors and a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Berkeley Public Health And we know that since then we have a larger number of asymptomatic people who are affecting the total number of infections but may not be included in confirmed case counts The findings supports previous statements by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that indicate the number of cases in the country is far greater than thought In June CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield said testing likely missed 90 or so of cases Dr Francis Collins director of the National Institutes of Health and Dr Jerome Adams US Surgeon General pledged in a Senate hearing Wednesday they would get the Covid19 vaccine if and when one is deemed safe I am ready to roll up my sleeve as soon as they say its effective Collins said when asked if he would get the vaccine in public view The two took questions from senators during the Senate Health Committee hearing on vaccines Adams and Collins assured the senators and the American public that the vaccine process was being led by science not partisan politics I want the American people to hear me say this There will be no shortcuts This vaccine will be safe It will be effective Or it wont get moved along Adams said And when a vaccine is either approved or authorized by the FDA I and my family will be in line to get it The comments come as the US continues to see widespread Covid19 infections particularly in areas where   Over the last seven days the US has averaged over 36000 daily new coronavirus cases according to Johns Hopkins University The US should be performing as many as 200 million Covid19 tests every month well into next year to have any chance of controlling the pandemic experts say in a new report That number is far beyond the countrys current capacity according to the report released Wednesday by the Rockefeller Foundation and the DukeMargolis Center for Health Policy The US will likely need very large numbers of all types of Covid19 tests well into 2021 to contain outbreaks while returning toward normal activity with a particular need for more screening tests that have very fast turnaround times the report reads Public health experts across the country have for months said testing will play a critical role in helping to reel in the pandemic Getting enough people tested  and getting their results back quickly  will aid contact tracers in tracking down Americans exposed to the virus and help control outbreaks  Fewer than 30 million tests are currently reported monthly in the country the report says As the virus ran unabated across American communities over the summer some officials said contact tracing was nearly impossible with the lack of testing capacity and the uncontrolled spread  Adm Brett Giroir the testing lead for the White House Coronavirus Task Force has said repeatedly the US cannot test its way out of the pandemic  Echoing other officials claims the report from the team of experts says more testing is vital At present infection rates a basic screening strategy will require approximately 200 million tests each month for students and staff at the nations primary and secondary schools and residents and staff at nursing homes for them to open safely and in stages the team wrote But things could turn around Testing capacity is improving and companies are working to develop fast and cheap onthespot tests that  if distributed widely enough  could make a difference the report says  By October 2020 based on recent and announced expected market entry pointofcare tests will rise to at least 70 million tests per month the team wrote By January the US could reach nearly 200 million tests monthly And more growth is possible the experts said  Meanwhile AstraZeneca said Tuesday it has   one of three

put on hold AstraZeneca had just announced the   in the US last week The stop may be temporary and the illness may not have been caused by the vaccine The company is making sure before it goes ahead with more testing The company didnt give details on the illness This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials while it is investigated ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials the company said in a statement In large trials illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully the company said Collins the NIH director said the AstraZeneca hold is due to spinal cord problem Collins said the pause is not at all unprecedented Indeed pausing in vaccine trials is very common according to Farrar of the Wellcome Trust and Dr Melanie Saville Director of Vaccine Research and Development at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations CEPI In many ways I think it shows that the oversight of the trial is working well Farrar said There are two other vaccine candidates in Phase 3 trials one developed by Moderna another by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech All three have US government funding and backing  The PfizerBioNTech vaccine could have its candidate ready for regulatory approval by midOctober Ugur Sahin CEO and cofounder of BioNTech said in an   with CNN It has an excellent profile and I consider this vaccine  near perfect and which has a near perfect profile Sahin said Pfizer and BioNTech say they plan to provide 100 million doses of their vaccine candidate BNT162 by the end of the year and up to 13 billion doses in 2021 Modernas Phase 3 trial started more than a month ago on July 27 The US government has a   for the company to deliver 100 million doses once the vaccine is approved  AstraZenecas pause on trials could give the public more confidence that companies are sticking to the safety first rule despite the push from President

{"7597": "The President spoke at a news conference on Wednesday about the worldwide health emergency that has seen the virus sweep into South Korea Italy and every continent but Antarctica sounding as if the danger had already passed rather than was yet to arrive The risk to the American people remains very low Trump said as he unveiled his big announcement   will head the government effort The Presidents optimistic performance came   said a patient in California who has the novel coronavirus might be the first person to be infected who did not travel to an afflicted region and was not exposed to another known carrier The case raises the ominous possibility that the virus is already moving through the community In anxious times including health emergencies presidents are called upon to show authority and credible planning and to inspire confidence and national unity among Americans The task is especially complicated for Trump given the three years of divideandrule politics he has used to cement power which has deepened mistrust among voters who do not support him His upbeat electionyear tone contrasted sharply with predictions from his government experts who are warning of possible severe disruption to American life if the outbreak swells into a pandemic He enlisted some of those officials who he touted as   in a rare appearance in the White House briefing room amid rising criticism that his administrations response to the virus is too little too late  Trumps main message was that there is   The President also claimed credit for his own wise steps that he said had kept Americans safe  no thanks to Democrats he said who have branded his approach to a possible pandemic as small ball Weve done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum the President said crediting his early curbs on travel from China Had I not made a decision very early on not to take people from a certain area we wouldnt be talking this way  I took a lot of heat some people called me racist His comments taken literally ought to have quelled any sense of panic But the Presidents incessant political gamesmanship will make it difficult for many viewers to shed suspicion he was minimizing the situation for personal gain  Trumps main aim Wednesday seemed to be to minimize the threat He went out of his way to compare the novel coronavirus to the seasonal flu  and marveled that so many Americans succumb to that ailment each year Presidents get judged on their handling of national crises And Trumps appearance left many questions unanswered Among them is whether he will be guided by science or politics in fighting the virus Another is whether he has the capacity to rally the nation behind him if things take a turn for the worse Its not a given that Trump has the selfdiscipline to manage the emergency and avoid counterproductive political grandstanding  The President can be sure of staunch support from his base whatever happens so any sense that a botched response could do for his presidency what the disastrous Hurricane Katrina relief effort did for George W Bush may not materialize The imprecision of Trumps language Wednesday did not exactly inspire confidence when he was asked if Americans should brace for a severe coronavirus outbreak I dont think it is inevitable I think we are doing a really good job There is a chance it could get worse There is a chance if could get fairly substantially worse Nothing is inevitable the President said in a vague summary of scenarios He also preferred to focus on the cases of small numbers of Americans repatriated from Japan and China who developed the virus and are in quarantine rather than the specter of a possible largescale US epidemic that his officials fear Were going to be pretty soon at only five people We could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time Trump said Yet health experts have said it is all but certain the coronavirus will end up being transmitted within the US given its rapid spread around Asia and Europe and across the world  Government health experts onstage with Trump had to tread a difficult line  between honoring their professional assessments and avoiding angering the President who dislikes being contradicted   Our aggressive containment strategy here in the United States has been working and is responsible for the low levels of cases that we have so far However we do expect more cases and this is a good time to prepare said Anne Schuchat principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases delivered the sobering news that even with an unusually accelerated process of development and testing it could be a year to a yearandahalf before a vaccine becomes available His assessment contrasts with Trumps hints that inoculations are just around the corner As is often the case in Trumps presidency nonpartisan career officials were forced to stand by his side as he unleashed flaming attacks on political opponents  in this case House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who had suggested to CNN earlier that he did not know what he was talking about on the coronavirus I think Speaker Pelosi is incompetent  She is trying to create a panic and theres no reason to panic because we have done so good Trump said with Schuchat  wearing a neutral expression  beside him in the camera shot A dividing line in tone and professionalism became clear between the politicians who took time out for obligatory praise of Trump and the professionals The Presidents early and decisive actions including travel restrictions have succeeded in buying us incredibly valuable time Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Pence whose new responsibility might turn into a poisoned political chalice if the outbreak reaches America and exacts a heavy toll also lauded Trump  From the first word of an outbreak of the coronavirus the President took unprecedented steps to protect the American people from the spread of this disease he said Confusion about the exact division of responsibilities between Pence and Azar suggests a not entirely smooth plan Im still chairman of the task force Azar said adding I was delighted that Id get to have the vice president helping me Delighted Such a hierarchy did not seem to be what the

{"5630": "After holding a press briefing on the fight against the coronavirus almost every day for the last month President Donald Trump has decided hes done For now What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions  then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately   They get record ratings  the American people get nothing but Fake News Not worth the time  effort That decision came   after weeks of cajoling and pleading by top Trump officials who saw his faltering poll numbers directly tied to his boastful and bitter performances at these daily briefings The obvious problem with Trump ending them is that the public is less aware of how the fight against the virus is going While Trump dominated these daily pressers  especially in recent weeks  there were still always actual updates provided by the likes of Vice President Mike Pence as well as Drs Anthony Facui and Deborah Birx Its not clear whether the administration will still make these experts available to the public even as Trump retreats from the daily spotlight Of course this is Donald Trump we are talking about A President more codependent on the media than any in history The real question then may be how long can Trump resist talking to the media before he reverses his current reversal  Ive had Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren ranked consistently in the  for Joe Biden in 2020 The reasons are obvious Shes a hugely popular figure with liberals nationwide and would help Biden energize that wing of the party come fall But increasingly theres chatter that picking Warren would come with a major potential downside Republican Gov Charlie Baker would be tasked with picking her Senate replacement  and he would almost certainly pick a Republican That would hand the GOP a bonus seat at the start of 2021  and trigger a special election in the summer for Warrens full term The rules in Massachusetts work like this Baker has the right to appoint an interim senator but also must call a special election for the seats between 145 and 160 days after the vacancy occurs If Warren was the VP pick and resigned on the day she and Biden were inaugurated January 20 2021 the soonest a special election could be held is Tuesday June 15 2021 and the latest June 29 2021 That would mean that for the first six months of Bidens presidency Republicans would have an extra seat which could be hugely important if the margin for control in the Senate was tight And yes Democrats would be favored to win Warrens Senate seat in a June 2021 special election even against Bakers appointed Republican But special elections are weird things  and   will be on Democrats minds Other potential VP picks Sens Kamala Harris California and Amy Klobuchar Minnesota represent states with Democratic governors making their selections far less problematic for Biden With the vast majority of states still adhering to stayathome and social distancing guidelines to limit the spread of coronavirus a clear partisan divide has emerged over how long we can keep it up One in four Republicans 26 said they could keep up the current social distancing for less than a month longer according to a new   Roughly half 14 of Democrats said the same  Those numbers are likely to play a role in  if not drive  decisions being made by governors across the country in coming weeks They suggest that governors in solidly Republican states may run an increasingly large political risk the longer they keep strict social distancing  and broader quarantine measures  in place There have already been a series of protests around the country aimed at loosening restrictions  and given Trumps recent return to   sort of rhetoric it seems likely that support for ongoing social distancing practices will continue to erode among Republicans Of course the decision on when to reopen a states economy isnt purely a political one Health considerations most especially the possibility of a significant bump in coronavirus cases have to be carefully weighed as well But the more Republicans voice frustration with social distancing the more likely that governors in GOPfriendly states are likely to speed up their calendars to reopen  For weeks allegations made by Reade a former Senate staffer that she was sexually assaulted by the thenDelaware senator in the early 1990s have been circulating in mostly conservative circles But Reades claim appeared to jump to a new level in recent days when   that purported to show Reades mother asking King for advice about how to handle problems her daughter had while working for a prominent US senator Im wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington the woman asks King My daughter has just left there after working for a prominent senator and could not get through with her problems at all and the only thing she could have done was go to the press and she chose not to do it out of respect for him The woman does not mention Reades name her own name or that of Biden   that she is certain it is her mothers voice  and some of the details of the call it was from San Luis Obispo California where her mother lived at the time seem to suggest it was indeed Reades mother who died a few years ago Biden has not said anything publicly about these latest allegations and his press team referred CNN back to a previous statement by deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press What is clear about this claim it is untrue This absolutely did not happen Heres the deal Given the progress the MeToo movement has made in recent years in pushing society to believe women its deeply hypocritical for Democrats  as many have done  to simply dismiss the Reade allegation Nor does the fact that   more than a dozen women fundamentally alter the need for Biden to directly address this Given the seriousness of the allegations  and the emergence of the 1993 phone call to Larry King Biden himself should step forward and address this headon Does he remember Reade Did they ever interact Had he ever heard of this allegation from her prior to a few weeks ago All questions that someone running for president should answer Remember that Biden isnt running to be Trump hes running in his words to restore dignity and honor back to the White House That process starts here  As Trumps job approval ratings sink  after a brief spike at the outset of the coronavirus crisis  members of his party are starting to get skittish about what it means for them at the ballot box this fall Wrote   True But the really truly scary reality for Republicans is not just Trumps numbers but this They are attached at the hip with him  no matter what happens in the next six months Early in Trumps presidency there was occasional acts of rebellion within the ranks  former Arizona Sen Jeff Flake being the most visible  all of which were eliminated after failing to garner any real support among establishment figures wary of Trump Now the die is cast There is no realistic chance  given how steadfastly the likes of Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell Kentucky and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy California have stood behind Trump amid his many many ups and downs  that they could possibly hope to distance their endangered incumbents from him now And that is very bad news for the likes of Colorado Sen Cory Gardner and Maine Sen Susan Collins  both of whom represent states Trump lost in 2016  as well as potentially Arizona Sen Martha McSally North Carolina Sen Thom Tillis and Georgia Sen Kelly Loeffler who represent states where Trumps winning margin four years ago was narrow In the House Trumps current numbers  and the inability for any GOP candidate or incumbent to distance themselves from him and his policies  make retaking the majority in November look increasingly like a long shot This is the deal Republicans made for themselves threeplus years ago Now they have to brace for a very large potential downside to it  and one they have very little ultimate control over"},

can do to help the industry tariffs are at the bottom of the list said Joe McMonigle senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management and a former Energy Department official The United States imported just 401000 barrels of oil per day from Saudi Arabia in January according to the US Energy Information Administration Thats down 44 from a year ago and among the lowest monthly total since the mid1980s Russia sent 95000 barrels to the United States in January Crude prices spiked by a record 32 last week on hopes of Moscow and Riyadh will declare a truce and massively cut their production Trump has done his part to raise expectations saying last week that Saudi Arabia and Russia could slash production by an astronomical 15 million barrels per day  The big picture Even if OPEC and Russia agree to cut production and even if they are joined by other major producers prices may not increase much in the near term Thats because of whats happening on the other side of the market equation  demand Demand for crude oil is collapsing at an unprecedented rate because of the coronavirus and theres not much Trump Russian President Vladimir Putin or Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed

markets Like other major economies around the world the United Kingdom has launched a massive rescue plan designed to help companies and workers through the pandemic After years of austerity the government is now spending at a prodigious rate and needs to finance those outlays Britain intends to auction £45 billion 56 billion in government debt in April alone Thats the highest monthly total on record according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies What the government said Thursday is that the central bank will step in and buy those bonds if they cant be absorbed by debt markets Now this will only be done on a temporary basis But monetary financing had been publicly opposed by the central bank in recent weeks suggesting some real doubts had emerged over whether the United Kingdom was going to find buyers for all that debt  Why does it matter Central banks have been buying bonds in the secondary market for years via quantitative easing programs But thats been done without such an explicit link between government spending plans and a commitment from the central bank to buy the resulting debt In a world of fiat money trust is key and so far investor faith in the institutional integrity of the system remains intact said Andrew Mulliner global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors As bonds investors any move to a more permanent form of direct financing of the

{"3347": "The states lab had been working through the night and one of his cabinet secretaries was on the line telling him 21 of the 42 crewmembers and passengers tested for   aboard the Grand Princess Cruise Ship which was idling in international waters off Californias coast had tested positive Newsom hung up and immediately called Donald Trump his frequent adversary reaching the President around 4 am PT to discuss the alarming results and their next steps according to California aides involved in the response By 6 am Newsom had fully activated the Golden States emergency operations center in the outskirts of Sacramento and begun orchestrating the unloading of more than 2000 passengers      That early morning call marked a new phase in the collaborative relationship that Newsom has built with Trump behind the scenes The governor has resolutely set politics aside Though there has been forcefulness on both sides Newsom has tried to cultivate what one aide referred to as a relationship defined by mutual aid respect understanding in the midst of disaster Cognizant of balancing Trumps penchant for punishing his critics with Californias reliance on the federal government for personal protective equipment ventilators medical stations and emergency funding Newsom has warmly praised the Trump administration for its assistance during his neardaily briefings while reeling off a dizzying litany of facts about the states readiness for the crisis  In the past the pair has sparred in public over everything from the cause of Californias wildfires to the states stringent environmental regulations Last year Trump mocked the 52yearold Newsom as the donothing governor in California Newsom for his part has insisted his state will stand up to a bully But their tone has shifted in the midst of this crisis as states scramble and compete with one another for supplies with lives on the line Newsom convinced   to send the USNS Mercy hospital ship to Californias aid by outlining a dire scenario in a letter to the president We project that roughly 56 percent of our population  255 million people  will be infected with the virus over an eightweek period  At this delicate diplomatic moment Newsom has nimbly steered around questions that would lead to direct confrontation with Trump including their disagreement over whether life can return to normal by Easter We are clearly operating under a different set of assumptions Newsom said when asked about Trumps desires during a recent briefing He added that in their many conversations in recent weeks it has been clear to him that the President understands the unique challenges faced by states like New York California and Washington state  I have no trepidation that whatever he decides to do from a national prism will not get in the way of our efforts here at the state level to do what we need to do to hit this head on bend the curve get people back to work as quickly as we can Newsom has indicated that he does not intend to lift the stayathome order anytime soon  With his telegenic appearance his reputation as a policy wonk and his welldocumented ambition Californias Democratic Governor has long been viewed as a likely presidential contender His political future now hinges on how well California fares in this unprecedented crisis He has faced the cameras as one of the countrys most proactive governors  the first in the nation   For the moment California has avoided the apocalyptic scenes that are unfolding in places like New York City but officials warn that the situation will soon get much worse It is unclear how pervasive the coronavirus outbreak has been in California because the state has lagged behind in test results a problem that stems from the limited availability of tests and a shortfall of key ingredients like reagents and swabs needed to conduct them In one of his first coronavirus briefings Newsom compared the test kits sent by the federal government to printers without ink  As of 2 pm Wednesday   of coronavirus and 65 dead  As the state has ramped up its testing capability the number of people who had been tested rose exponentially midweek to 77800 with results pending on more than 57400 tests  State officials said Wednesday that coronavirus cases in California are now doubling every three to four days similar to the rate in New York and that they expect a surge in patients within the next week or two As in other parts of the country medical professionals across the state have sounded the alarm about the shortage of masks gowns and gloves Newsom said Wednesday that California has distributed 245 million masks with another 100 million on order That is a significant number but it is still insignificant to meet our needs  But the situation has put Newsom at odds with his longtime ally the California Nurses Association Our members have not received in their hands the necessary protection to take care of patients said Stephanie Roberson government relations director for the California Nurses Association We need the masks and currently they are not getting to our members Newsoms daytoday counts on the current availability of critical equipment like N95 masks was an example of one of the many metrics he has been tracking since the early days of the crisis Given the complexity of the problems inherent in meeting the needs of a diverse state of 40 million Newsom plunged into the logistical minutiae of the crisis from the beginning  As someone who has struggled from dyslexia since he was a child Newsom has tackled the coronavirus response as he has many other policy topics with a focus on mastering the information through his many conversations with experts repeatedly studying important policy points to internalize them  He is perpetually armed with policy papers covered with circled words facts and scribbled notes which one advisor described as the unique method Newsom uses to ensure the information sinks in    John A Pérez the former California Assembly Speaker and current Chair of Californias Board of Regents who identified himself as a fellow dyslexic said he and Newsom use some of the same methods to absorb information  Neither of us is overly dependent on written material in the moment of delivering a message Pérez said Its really figuring out how how to internalize the facts so that you can really process them in your head because you cant always trust your eyes to process them on paper  You just have to own the information and really know it because you cant process it on the page the same way others can Perez said And as a result I think you do more hard work Newsom has gotten high marks from leaders across the state But US Rep Ro Khanna noted it was northern California mayors and county leaders who laid the groundwork for the statewide shutdown with their initial orders which came three days   I credit most our local mayors Santa Clara and Alameda County leaders and the Bay Area for setting the example of how to tackle Covid19 Khanna said He said that those city and county leaders were first to act on a shelter in place which I am glad our Governor has also called for The shortage of ventilators and masks is unacceptable period Our Silicon Valley tech leaders mayors and governor are stepping up to fill a vacuum in our national leadership But we still need national leadership No state can mobilize resources to the extent the federal government can US Rep Anna Eshoo who represents Silicon Valley credited Newsom with being creative through his use of executive orders and aggressive in his cold calls to business leaders  Gov Newsom deserves an A plus right along with the governor of Washington state and Andrew Cuomo Eshoo said This has become a selfhelp undertaking and that should not be the case I think he has risen to the occasion   Since that overnight call to Trump about the coronavirus cases aboard the Grand Princess Newsom has embedded with his top aides at Californias emergency operations center in Sacramento There they ran through the worstcase scenario that could hit California and began unfurling the states pandemic plans Since then aides and leaders close to the governor say he has been continually on the phone with a wide array of medical experts CEOs pharmaceutical companies and state officials attempting to troubleshoot the problems that were beginning to erupt in the state  In the rush to meet the moment as Newsom often says he and his team temporarily leased shuttered hospitals including Seton Medical Center in Daly City which began accepting up to 220 coronavirus patients on Wednesday and St Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles which can house an additional 366 patients when it comes back on line On Wednesday  the same day that unemployment claims in California hit one million people just more than a week and a half period  Newsom  from Citigroup JPMorgan Chase US Bank and Wells Fargo along with some 200 statechartered banks credit unions and servicers to give Californians affected by  a 90day grace period to make mortgage payments In his briefing he repeatedly called out Bank of America as the only one of the big banks that had not yet agreed to the 90day period part of his effort to nudge them along  Newsom also exacted a promise from Tesla CEO Elon Musk to procure   and tapped Apples Tim Cook to donate 1 million masks to the state of California Musk delivered more than 1200 ventilators to Los Angeles this week and Newsom said he was working overtime with companies in his supply chain to try to start working up ventilator components Knowing the state had a stockpile of older ventilators that needed to be refurbished the California governor reached out to KR Sridhar the CEO of Bloom Energy which produces power   who agreed to quickly get many of them back into use after the manufacturer told state officials it would take a month Describing some of those efforts last week Newsom said he had spoken to more scientists researchers engineers Nobel Laureates and CEOs in the prior 48 hours than I have quite literally in years  He continues to chide Californians who are not obeying the stayathome order insisting that social pressure will be more effective than the hammer in coaxing them to stay home After seeing pictures of younger Californians out on the beaches over the weekend Newsom bluntly addressed them during one of his briefings Those young people who are still out there on the beaches thinking its time to party Its time to grow up time to wake up Newsom said   Though Newsom is younger than many of the other governors grappling with the coronavirus he honed his crisis management skills over many years of government service  from his early tenure on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to his stint as San Franciscos lightningrod mayor and then as lieutenant governor under Jerry Brown who was at first brusque and dismissive of the much younger Newsom He has touted his understanding of the pressures on small businesses from his own experience opening his own wine shop in 1992 on Fillmore Street in San Francisco with the investment help of Gordon Getty a longtime friend of his fathers which he and his partners ultimately expanded into the profitable slate of restaurants and wineries known as the Plumpjack Group But coming from a politically connected family on his fathers side the allure of politics proved irresistible to Newsom  Willie Brown the veteran Speaker of the California State Assembly and San Francisco mayor helped Newsom get his start by appointing him to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1997 Newsom rose to national prominence in the debate over gay rights a year after he succeeded Brown as mayor of San Francisco  when he began issuing marriage licenses to samesex couples  a move that was halted by the courts The controversial unions immediately became a national flashpoint  Some gay rights advocates worried that the brash San Francisco mayor had risked their carefully calibrated legal strategy nationally When it erupted into a major presidential campaign issue some leading Democrats including California Sen Dianne Feinstein suggested it had contributed to John Kerrys loss in 2004 Feinstein a mentor to Newsom   that she believed it did energize a very conservative vote I think that whole issue has been too much too fast too soon she said And people arent ready for it   Newsom was at the forefront on other progressive issues including tackling homelessness in San Francisco throughout his tenure as mayor  and he has continued to champion the issue as governor proposing more than 1 billion early this year to expand housing healthcare substance abuse treatment and mental health services for the homeless population  His two years as governor have been defined in part by Californias defiance of Trump and the states pride in serving as the center of the resistance to Trump administration policies In Trumps State of the Union speech this year the President cited California as an example of a state with government systems that are totally out of control costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money Newsom responded during a February 11 appearance on ABCs The View  Were going to stand up to a bully he said  arguing that the state was prospering with a 215 billion operating surplus and noting that one in seven of the jobs created in America since 2011 originated in California  We are the most unTrump state in America and we are also the most diverse state in America 27 of our state foreignborn Newsom said Its hard for him And were also suing him Sixtyseven lawsuits and were beating him across the board over and over and over again Now in a turn of fate Newsom and the commanderinchief are working together "},

services including stopping the movement of troops between installations worldwide and canceling training exercises and even delaying some basic training for recruits All that comes at a cost including weariness among troops who were expecting to be rotated back to the States or lack of familiarity with missions or equipment because training cannot take place Jonathan Hoffman US assistant secretary of defense for public affairs told reporters last week the Pentagon makes daily risk assessments with an eye to regaining full operational capability more quickly But some analysts have suggested that in the South China Sea even shortterm pullbacks can create an opening the PLA could take advantage of I think China is exploiting the US Navys coronavirus challenges to improve its position in the South China Sea by giving the appearance it can and will operate there at will while the US is hamstrung said Carl Schuster a retired US Navy captain and a former director of operations at the US Pacific Commands Joint Intelligence Center China claims almost the entire 13 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory and it has aggressively asserted its stake in recent years in the face of conflicting claims from several Southeast Asian nations The US has long accused Beijing of militarizing islands there via the deployment of military hardware and construction of military facilities Schuster used the recent sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat to illustrate how China will push its position The fishing boat sank last Thursday in water near the Paracels also known as the Xisha islands in the northern part of the sea Both China and Vietnam claim sovereignty over the island group China said the boat sank after it rammed a China Coast Guard vessel that intercepted it in Chinese waters Vietnam said its fishing boat was operating legally and blamed the sinking on the Chinese Both sides acknowledge the fishing boats crew was rescued by the Chinese ship Many analysts have noted that Vietnam appears to moving closer to the US as a result of tensions in the South China Sea In fact the   before the coronavirus cases turned up on board The fiveday port visit in early March only the second by a US aircraft carrier to Vietnam since the Vietnam War was in commemoration of 25 years of USVietnam diplomatic relations It involved cultural and sports exchanges as well as ironically a professional exchange focused on cooperating on infectious disease prevention However Schuster noted that the incident with the fishing boat may send a message to Hanoi that it has cozied up to the US at a time when the US is not in a position to respond to Chinese actions In a story posted on its Englishlanguage website Friday the PLA said that the outbreak of Covid19 has significantly lowered the US Navys warship deployment capability in the AsiaPacific region Aircraft carriers with their complement of 90 warplanes and helicopters are the US Navys most visible and among its most imposing assets But with the Roosevelt quarantined in Guam for an indefinite period it is unclear how easily it can be replaced in its South China Sea role While the US has 11 aircraft carriers in its fleet the nuclearpowered ships require extensive overhauls and longterm maintenance at regular intervals making few available to deploy at any one time   showed only five carriers available as of March 30 One of those is the Roosevelt another is the Reagan two others are deployed in to the Persian Gulf to respond to possible threat from Iran and the fifth is on the US East Coast  Moving a carrier from one spot on the worlds oceans to another can leave vulnerabilities in the area it departed According to Schuster the perception that US readiness has been impacted could embolden China as to carry out an increased number of exercises in the South China Sea such as those carried out in March China has consistently pushed back at the suggestion it is attempting to use the pandemic to gain geopolitical influence  At at press briefing on April 3 Chinas Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying described the spread of the virus as a war But when fighting an intense battle does anyone think of how much prize they will get after the war The most important thing is doing your best and racing against time to achieve the final victory said Hua  We would like to share Chinas good practice and experience with other countries but we will not turn it into any kind of geopolitical weapon or tool she added  The US State Department has taken issue with that In a statement Monday spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus called the incident with the Vietnamese fishing boat just the latest in a long string of PRC Peoples Republic of China actions to assert unlawful maritime claims and disadvantage its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea We call on the PRC to remain focused on supporting international efforts to combat the global pandemic and to stop exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states to expand its unlawful claims in the South China Sea the statement said Meanwhile the PLA has consistently maintained that it doesnt face the same kind of coronavirus concerns the US does noting a month ago that   with Covid19 There is widespread international skepticism about that claim But according to Schuster China enjoys some advantages in controlling or at least concealing the number of infections it has in its naval forces While the US Navy fleet is scattered across the Pacific far from its home shores and operating longer patrols most PLA Navy ships are at sea under 30 days at a time and operating close to their bases said Schuster enabling them to replace known infected crewmen off the ship with known healthy sailors from other ship Nor do their South China or East China Sea deployments include foreign port visits The ships go out do a five to 10day exercise and return to a military home port where

{"762": " had escalated while he was abroad setting off a chain reaction of concern and criticism including a stock market selloff that had erased more than 15 trillion in wealth over the prior two days  a dangerous sign for the US economy and Trumps reelection prospects On the way back to the White House Trump decided it was time to take the reins himself he would hold a news conference that evening confident in his ability to bend the public narrative to his will Yet as the day went on and plans for the news conference came together uncertainty reigned By 430 pm the jetlagged President had only just come down to the Oval Office from the residence and to the assembled officials who were there it was still unclear what he intended to say at the news conference which was just two hours away said one senior Republican who was in the White House Earlier in the week Trump had privately told allies he was close to taking the coronavirus response efforts out of the hands of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar two sources familiar with the matter said Despite denials from the White House that he was   to lead the federal response when Trump stepped up to the lectern in the White House briefing room thats effectively what he did by putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge The Pence decision was made shortly before the news conference and came as a shock to Azar according to a senior Republican official Pence a frequent defender of Azar during his rocky relationship with the President had agreed to step in though there didnt appear to be much of a choice Senior people who work for the vice president were caught by surprise by the announcement according to one official who spoke to CNN For weeks some of Trumps aides and allies have tried to impress upon him the seriousness of the coronavirus situation warning him of the threat to the global economy and  by proxy  his reelection prospects according to people familiar with the conversations  Motivated by devastating losses on Wall Street Trump finally decided to heed that advice Yet its unclear how much it helped  His instincts led him to downplay the seriousness of the threat once again on Wednesday undermining the predictions of his own top health officials standing behind him and fueling concern over his administrations ability to coordinate a response to a complicated problem  The financial fallout has also gotten worse  The markets provided an initial verdict on Trumps performance Wednesday  Dow futures moved from positive to negative during the news conference Markets opened deep in the red on Thursday By the time the market closed that afternoon the Dow had   bringing the total amount of wealth erased over the past week to more than 2 trillion  Congressional Republicans who   over the White House response to the coronavirus were left scratching their heads  One House Republican told CNN the falling stock market was the only metric you needed to look at to see how poorly that was handled   We trust the President but we really trust the Presidents experts It would be a lot better if publicly they were more aligned the member said  Interviews with more than 20 sources across Washington  including lawmakers White House officials health experts and diplomats  paint a picture of deep concern over the widening coronavirus outbreak and the Trump administrations readiness to handle the crisis  As recently as last week Trump was telling confidants that he doesnt foresee the virus making a big impact in the US And on Wednesday he repeated his belief that it could be slowed by warmer weather despite no evidence to support the claim Now the White House is confronting what some officials describe as the biggest governing challenge of Trumps presidency Mindful that a botched response would spell potential political ruin efforts have scaled up rapidly in the past several days and one official said the response was nearing an allconsuming endeavor For the past month there have been daily coronavirus meetings in the White House Situation Room Yet its unclear how effective they have been  One person familiar with the discussions said the attendees at the meetings were often at a loss for how to solve the problems associated with the coronavirus and for weeks were focused primarily on ways to prevent anyone infected or definitively exposed to the disease  including American citizens  from traveling to the US Officials have delivered topline numbers and broadstrokes information about the outbreak without delving into nittygritty specifics a person familiar with the matter said believing Trump to be uninterested in deeply detailed updates  Some officials have blamed the cursory briefings for a breakdown in communication that has led to bursts of outrage by the President who has complained hes been kept out of the loop on key decisions regarding potentially infected Americans returning to the US  There is evidence things are improving Speaking to CNN on Thursday one government official working with the White House on its coronavirus response said There has been a sea of change since yesterday noting that the situation had gone from zero communication to multiple conversations on Thursday  This official noted that while the White House still didnt seem to have a full communications plan in place it was reaching out to get an understanding of what was needed including giving regular updates on travel State Department officials remain on edge given how unpredictable Trump is and that he is a known germophobe according to a source familiar with the situation Some predict he will suddenly make a rash decision such as barring incoming flights with people who could be infected  Some US diplomats stationed overseas in countries where there are coronavirus cases are asking to come home two sources say  Several people close to Pence fear that his appointment could spell political disaster for the vice president putting him in an impossible position given health experts warning that the virus will spread more in the US before the situation improves  Trump put Pence in because he thinks Pence will f it up a Trump adviser said describing some of the fears already being expressed by people close to the vice president  But one GOP official noted Pence has credibility on Capitol Hill a factor that could settle anxious lawmakers I think people trust Pence the official said Another GOP official said Pence was a poor choice to lead the response given   The source also said the President shouldve put someone with medical experience in charge    Its unclear whether Pence who has numerous campaignrelated events in the coming weeks will remain in Washington to coordinate or keep his campaign schedule  On Thursday Pence made a few additions to the Coronavirus Task Force including economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin He also appointed Deborah L Birx as White House coronavirus response coordinator  Birx an American physician and diplomat who serves as ambassadoratlarge and as US global AIDS coordinator was appointed to her current job during the Obama administration According to a source familiar with her situation Birx was able to develop a close relationship with the Trump White House in part because a Trump campaign official Matt Mowers became her chief of staff and remained in that role for almost two years Birx has overhauled the HIV strategy for the Trump administration and in 2018 she and Pence developed a relationship when she spoke at the World AIDS Day event at the White House   Birx did not ask for this job  the White House came to her sources said   The animating fear for Trump will likely be the continued economic fallout from the coronavirus The economy has slowed with each successive year of the Presidents term as his tax cuts have failed to sparked sustained business investment and his trade war has inhibited it That places the economic expansion at the mercy of consumers and their continued confidence The peril for Trump is that the coronavirus could yet tip the economy into recession Mark Zandi chief economist at Moodys Analytics currently puts odds of a 2020 recession at even money but says it would become probable if the crisis swells to a global pandemic  An American president has not sought reelection during a recession since Jimmy Carter in 1980 Carter lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan  Whether Trump understands the magnitude of that risk in unclear If inveterate optimists on his team like

night include some of Trumps Republican allies in Congress Sen Tim Scott House GOP Whip Steve Scalise Rep Matt Gaetz and Rep Jim Jordan former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and the Presidents eldest son Donald Trump Jr  The night will also feature speeches from private figures who have lent their voices to supporting the Trump administration or exhibited values the President has commended including the St Louis couple who were filmed brandishing guns at a group of protesters walking along the neighborhoods private street  Heres what to watch on Monday After a series of convention venue changes  from North Carolina to Florida and back to North Carolina again  the formal convention will kick off in Charlotte for one inperson event before moving the rest of the production to the nations capital  The formal presidential nomination process began in Charlotte on Monday morning attended by six delegates from each state and territory amounting to a total of 336 delegates according to the RNC RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel presided over the nomination process which concluded with Trump being formally nominated as partys nominee for President  Following

delivering his nomination acceptance speech Thursday evening from the White House  The President has struggled to outline his goals for a second term in the Oval Office but on the eve of the convention the Trump campaign announced a specific set of second term priorities which convention speakers will likely touch on during Mondays events and through Thursdays schedule  The Republican National Committee also confirmed on Sunday that it would not release a new platform during the 2020 convention  and in lieu of one the party will support Trumps agenda  Many of the goals in the list released on Sunday signaled a continuation of the Presidents priorities such as lowering the cost of drugs cutting taxes decreasing unlawful immigration into the US developing a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year and creating new jobs  But some priorities established a renewed level of importance to issues the President hasnt talked about as frequently including ending cashless bail establishing congressional term limits prosecuting driveby shootings as acts of domestic terrorism and establishing a permanent manned presence on the moon  The list of policy goals also places a specific target on China  devoting a section priorities to the issue which called for incentivizing the US to bring jobs back from China prohibiting federal contracts to companies who outsource to China and holding China fully accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world  Republicans are expected to counter the message Democrats set out to paint last week at the Democratic

convention Trump held a press conference to   the US Food and Drug Administrations emergency use authorization for treatment of convalescent plasma for coronavirus patients That announcement came days after the he accused deep state elements in the agency of stalling approvals to hurt his campaign The start of the convention also follows a series of major news stories unflattering for Trump  Last

{"5574": "Read the order here SUSPENSION OF ENTRY OF IMMIGRANTS WHO PRESENT A RISK TO THE UNITED STATES LABOR MARKET DURING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOLLOWING THE 2019 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK            BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   A PROCLAMATION          The 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID19 has significantly disrupted the livelihoods of Americans  In Proclamation 9994 of March 13 2020 Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease COVID19 Outbreak I declared that the COVID19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency beginning March 1 2020  Since then the American people have united behind a policy of mitigation strategies including social distancing to flatten the curve of infections and reduce the spread of SARSCoV2 the virus that causes COVID19  This needed behavioral shift has taken a toll on the United States economy with national unemployment claims reaching historic levels  In the days between the national emergency declaration and April 11 2020 more than 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment      In the administration of our Nations immigration system we must be mindful of the impact of foreign workers on the United States labor market particularly in an environment of high domestic unemployment and depressed demand for labor  We must also conserve critical State Department resources so that consular officers may continue to provide services to United States citizens abroad  Even with their ranks diminished by staffing disruptions caused by the pandemic consular officers continue to provide assistance to United States citizens including through the ongoing evacuation of many Americans stranded overseas       I have determined that without intervention the United States faces a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment if labor supply outpaces labor demand  Excess labor supply affects all workers and potential workers but it is particularly harmful to workers at the margin between employment and unemployment who are typically last in during an economic expansion and first out during an economic contraction  In recent years these workers have been disproportionately represented by historically disadvantaged groups including African Americans and other minorities those without a college degree and the disabled  These are the workers who at the margin between employment and unemployment are likely to bear the burden of excess labor supply disproportionately        Furthermore lawful permanent residents once admitted are granted openmarket employment authorization documents allowing them immediate eligibility to compete for almost any job in any sector of the economy  There is no way to protect already disadvantaged and unemployed Americans from the threat of competition for scarce jobs from new lawful permanent residents by directing those new residents to particular economic sectors with a demonstrated need not met by the existing labor supply  Existing immigrant visa processing protections are inadequate for recovery from the COVID19 outbreak  The vast majority of immigrant visa categories do not require employers to account for displacement of United States workers  While some employmentbased visas contain a labor certification requirement because visa issuance happens substantially after the certification is completed the labor certification process cannot adequately capture the status of the labor market today  Moreover introducing additional permanent residents when our healthcare resources are limited puts strain on the finite limits of our healthcare system at a time when we need to prioritize Americans and the existing immigrant population  In light of the above I have

{"8414": "Trump made the rare trip to Capitol Hill on Tuesday after promising major and dramatic economic steps But while sources familiar with the lunch said a multitude of options were discussed members emerged without a concrete plan After the hourlong meeting in the Capitol where the conversation included proposals of payroll tax holidays for workers targeted relief for hardhit industries  like airlines cruise ships restaurants and retail  tax cuts to help small businesses better afford sick leave for their workers and other proposals some GOP senators remained skeptical about quickly passing an expensive stimulus package  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a Democrat would have ball control on negotiations that could take place in the coming weeks and that Senate Republicans would defer to them to see if they could cut a deal   Ultimately its a decision between the President of the United States and Speaker Pelosi because she has to get something through the House explained Sen John Barrasso of Wyoming a member of the Republican leadership Several senators said the most pressing item for Congress to take up was passing a law to help certify additional masks for use in hospitals a bill thats sponsored by GOP Sen Deb Fischer of Nebraska Like this week Like right now Like yesterday said Republican Sen John Kennedy of Louisiana who said there was hope the Senate would pass it this week Sen Ron Johnson a Wisconsin Republican said that senators talked about a host of things we can do We talked about infrastructure we talked about that specific problem right now with a law regarding the certification of those masks We talked about obviously payroll tax relief Johnson said He wants action Johnson said about Trump He realizes this is an extraordinary event and might require extraordinary action During the lunch presentations were given by Mnuchin Vice President Mike Pence Larry Kudlow the director of the National Economic Council and Trump  But they were just a starting point as Republican members also threw ideas at the wall It was a conversation participants said  Some Republican senators have been skeptical of a payroll tax cut which would put extra cash into peoples pockets in hopes of boosting the economy Several lawmakers have questioned how effective it would be during the outbreak when more people are being encouraged to stay home According to several sources familiar with the lunch Trump floated the idea of a permanent payroll tax cut but also weighed having a temporary cut that lasted for several months  While some assumed it would be limited Trump suggested he wouldnt want the tax cut to expire before the November presidential election noting at one point that he would get credit from voters if it passed according to one person familiar Regarding the idea of a permanent tax cut Indiana Sen Mike Braun later told CNN Its probably something I wouldnt do One GOP senator said there was a discussion about a proposal to extend tax credits for small companies that want to provide family and sick leave to their employees a key issue during the outbreak since some workers who dont get sick pay might refuse to stay home when they are ill if it means missing a paycheck  The senator said they also discussed actions the administration could take on its own that would help the economy like waiving the requirement that people make their estimated tax payments The idea would be relatively inexpensive the senator said because interest rates are low and it would keep a lot of money in the economy that otherwise would have gone to pay quarterly taxes Trumps top economic advisers raised the idea of paid family sick leave and targeted relief for industries hardest hit by the outbreak like hotels airlines and cruise lines  A lot of Republicans emerging from the meeting were sensitive that the President is clearly troubled by the downturn in the stock market a fact that was clear during lunch Tuesday But Republicans are also struggling to square the Presidents worries with traditional Republican orthodoxy that government intervention in the economy  especially this early  could be seen as a shift in GOP policy given some of the Republican backlash to the bailouts of 2008 Sen Pat Roberts a Republican from Kansas said he wished there had been a bit more detail about what was actually on the table  I dont have a list I wish I had a list Roberts said adding that Trump was determined to get something done on the economy Sen Richard Shelby the chairman of the Appropriations Committee said GOP senators asked Trump how the package would be paid for but they didnt get an answer Some Republican senators were still cautious about the idea of an economic stimulus even after Trumps sell The bottom line is that some of these are not traditional Republican ideas Mandatory paid sick leave for example isnt necessarily widely accepted within the GOP conference and the length and scope of the payroll tax cut was also considered controversial for some Braun said he was skeptical of a package of economic stimulus items that were aimed at propping up large corporations from the oil industry to the airlines You got to be careful even here that we arent doing this based off of hysteria or overdramatization he warned  Braun added If it is aimed at small businesses you know I would probably look at it differently If it is trying to help an oil industry then I think they can take care of themselves Leaving the lunch Trump offered no details on the discussions but said Youll be hearing about it soon"},

according to an announcement broadcast on the ship and recorded on the video It would have been our preference to be the first to make this news available to you One passenger Debbi Loftus told CNN Friday she was watching MSNBC when she saw Pences briefing on the ship  I thought the passengers were supposed to be notified first she said adding that she was celebrating her fathers 84th birthday aboard the Grand Princess The fact that we werent told first made us quite upset and angry  Theres no excuse for this   Pence said Friday hes working with California Gov Gavin Newsom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a plan for the Grand Princess to return to a noncommercial port  All passengers and crew will be tested for

Princess  2422 guests and 1111 crew members Princess Cruises said They represent 54 nationalities  As of Friday afternoon California had 65 positive confirmed cases of coronavirus and one death The Grand Princess was on a twoweek trip from San Francisco to Hawaii and was scheduled to return Saturday  The ship was diverted toward San Francisco on Wednesday  with a planned stop in Mexico canceled    in Placer County His was the first coronavirus fatality outside Washington state in an outbreak thats killed   The man who hasnt been named publicly was 71  Placer County health officials said He was likely exposed to the virus on a Grand Princess cruise between February 11 and 21 from San Francisco to Mexico  Shortly after the Grand Princess  last month it started the latest cruise with some people from the February cruise remaining on the ship for the current cruise Some of those identified for testing included several who were on the Mexico voyage with the victim At least six passengers who disembarked from that February trip tested positive including the man who died The latest person to be infected was a Ventura County resident who has been quarantined at home with mild symptoms according to county officials  No guests were allowed to disembark until all test results were received Princess Cruises said in a statement The captain advised passengers Thursday night that more people than the initial 45 may be tested on Friday according to a video clip CNN obtained from inside the ship from passenger Teresa Duncan Johnson   Though all guests have been asked to stay in their

first coronavirus case in Hawaii was a passenger who traveled on the Grand Princess according to Gov David Ige The state is examining the manifest of Grand Princess passengers to contact those who stopped in Hawaii asking that they selfquarantine according to state Health Director Bruce Anderson  Three presumptive positive cases were found in Placer County California All three of those passengers were on the Grand Princess according to the countys health department Two of them had mild symptoms that have been resolved and the third currently has mild symptoms the health department said in a press release  All three are isolated at home and none required hospitalization the release said  There are 10 confirmed US cases of coronavirus who were on the cruise ship Newsom has

Democrats who dont want to be forced to take the vote I think theres a good chance well have an agreement But we dont need artificial deadlines We will get this done We will come in at noon and hopefully we will have an agreement by then Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer who made the objection said on the Senate floor McConnell blasted Schumers move as reckless and warned the markets will now be open for three hours before they can get some certainty a stimulus bill will pass the Senate A vote in the Senate is now expected at 1 pm As coronavirus hits the Senate — with   and several others   — tensions are running high on Capitol Hill While Republicans are urging quick action Democrats argue that Republicans are prioritizing corporate industry over American workers in the legislation During his remarks Sunday night McConnell criticized his Democratic colleagues saying if they did not reverse course tomorrow the vote they cast Sunday not to move the bill forward would cause more Americans to lose their jobs and savings Democrats have argued the Republican proposal is weighted too heavily towards corporate America Democrats registered their frustration with the package earlier in the day by lining up against a key procedural vote to advance it The vote was 4747 Lawmakers needed to clear a 60vote threshold to succeed The vote originally set for 3 pm ET was delayed until 6 pm as Democrats dug in against it and to allow for more time for negotiations A final bipartisan deal to respond to the toll of the spread of coronavirus has not yet been reached but talks are expected to continue into Sunday evening Senators were voting instead on a shell bill that McConnell is using as a placeholder until a final deal is reached   Further complicating matters there are now five GOP senators in selfquarantine or isolation  Kentucky Sen Rand Paul who has tested positive for coronavirus as well as Sens Mike Lee and Mitt Romney of Utah Cory Gardner of Colorado and Rick Scott of Florida  That means that the 5347 GOP majority is now reduced to 4847 A stimulus bill will need 60 votes to pass in the Senate meaning it will have to have substantial bipartisan support to get to 60 but the diminishing vote strength of the majority is on the minds of Republicans negotiating with Democrats to approve this mustpass bill  Two senators introduced   on Thursday to amend the rules to allow senators to vote remotely during a national crisis but McConnell has consistently opposed such a measure  McConnell has continued to urge swift passage of the legislation arguing that it is necessary to quickly enact relief measures as the nation reels from the impact of coronavirus  Schumer told reporters after the procedural vote was initially delayed that the legislation initially presented to Democrats had many many problems saying that it included a large corporate bailout provision with no protections for workers and virtually no oversight Schumer said however that Democrats want to move forward with bipartisan agreement adding that the stafflevel work is ongoing to change some problematic provisions with the legislation Earlier in the day Schumer had said there were serious issues with the current proposal and negotiators would be meeting soon to try and iron them out  Democratic Sen Elizabeth Warren echoed that message saying that there is great unhappiness in the Democratic caucus about the proposal as it currently stands The Massachusetts senator cited the proposed 500 billion fund for distressed companies which she complained lacked restrictions  This is not a bipartisan proposal Warren said This is a Republican proposal The latest pushback from Democrats comes as the Senate gears up to take a key procedural vote Sunday to advance the stimulus package  and amid the news that Sen Rand Paul of Kentucky has become   which has increased the sense of urgency among senators wary of being in close proximity  In addition House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sounded an ominous warning Sunday that she may not support an emerging   bill that had been on a fast track through Congress this weekend and that has   according to two people directly involved in the talks  Departing a meeting with the top four congressional leaders and   Pelosi said there is no deal yet and that the House will introduce its own bill   something that could significantly draw out the process to finalize legislation  The fate of a final proposal     is in the hands of the four congressional leaders all of whom gathered in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells office on Sunday  Pushback from Democrats has centered on not only the substance of the legislation but also on the process that Republicans used to come up with it arguing that they were locked out of negotiations at the start McConnell has   his approach   Thursday Republicans are in the majority in the Senate We wanted to put forward our proposal We feel like we have an obligation to do that as a majority and the Democrats of course need to be given an opportunity to react to it Democrats including Schumer argued however that that approach would risk delaying efforts to find quick agreement And as of Sunday afternoon no bipartisan agreement had yet been reached  McConnell struck an optimistic tone in a news conference after the meeting despite the fact that no bipartisan deal has been reached yet He said that negotiators are very close and that he is confident that they will get to yes  McConnell insisted that the vote on final passage is still happening Monday saying Make no mistake about it Well be voting tomorrow  I mean the wheel has to stop at some point and I dont want any of you to buy the notion that this isnt a thoroughly bipartisan proposal already McConnell added But Pelosi sounded a different message on her way into that critical meeting From my standpoint were apart Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol when asked if she expected a deal Sunday The Senate did consider input from Pelosi and House committees who worked through Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to provide it Schumer told reporters after the four corners meeting that lawmakers are continuing to talk Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said he hopes McConnell will think twice before he has a showdown vote this afternoon as bipartisan negotiations on the massive economic package continue Im anxious to see what Speaker Pelosi would put on the table Durbin said when asked about Pelosi saying she would introduce her own coronavirus funding bill Asked if he thinks Senate Democrats would vote against cloture on the economic stimulus bill Sunday the Illinois senator said hes not going to speculate as negotiations are still ongoing   On Saturday Schumer signaled he might accept the bill But on Sunday morning Democratic sources said they had uncovered numerous problems with provisions dealing with aid to workers and loan assistance to businesses   If Pelosi doesnt support the bill Senate Democrats could stall action on the bill by blocking a procedural motion set for a vote Sunday afternoon The Speaker also could change it when the bill goes to the House if it passes the Senate on Monday as Senate Republicans and the White House want That could slow getting out the muchneeded aid to workers and businesses Pressure would mount — from Wall Street to Main Street — on Pelosi and House Democrats if they dont adct quickly The scale of the package  which has grown by over a trillion dollars over the course of several days and by more than 500 billion just during Saturdays negotiations alone the people said  underscores the recognition of the urgency brought on by   that has all but shuttered the American economy over the last week Staff worked through the night  some in the office past 3 am ET people told CNN  to draft the legislative language to reflect the status of the negotiations between the four bipartisan working groups that have been cloistered in closed Senate hearing rooms for hours over the course of an urgent last few days  Republicans have expressed optimism that a deal is in the offing but there are still a handful of hurdles that have kept Democratic negotiators from fully signing on That said lawmakers on both sides acknowledge that a deal is imperative as soon as possible Mnuchin   and said lawmakers have a fundamental understanding that a deal has been reached to pass a massive stimulus bill as soon as Monday Democrats very much want to reach a bipartisan agreement to address this major health and economic crisis Justin Goodman spokesman for Schumer said in a statement Saturday night There is not yet an agreement and we still have not seen large parts of the Republican draft Key outstanding issues according to people involved in the talks and those who have seen the draft Republican proposal center on two fronts the total aid package that can be directed to the states and the restrictions included in the aid pool created for distressed large industries  That piece of the package has grown to more than 500 billion according to a person familiar with the Republican bill as its drafted to this point grants significant discretion to the Treasury secretary in terms of how the money must be used and the scale of the restrictions for the companies that receive loans as it relates to future stock buy backs  a key ask for Democratic negotiators  Democrats  for an expansion of stabilization funds for states and localities  a request from the National Governors Association While a significant amount of money has been included much of it through the addition of the supplemental emergency funds that has been fold into the bill Democrats have pressed for more as states face significant budget shortfalls in the months ahead  Democrats have however secured wins on several other key priorities including an expansion and enhancement of unemployment insurance to the tune of at least 250 billion the people said They have also negotiated significant funds to be directed toward health care providers and front line health workers  Bipartisan negotiators also reached an agreement in principle on a 350 billion forgivable loan package for small businesses that would be designed to keep employees paid even as business ground to a halt  The total cost of the package has been the subject of some confusion over the weekend with Larry Kudlow the director of President Donald Trumps National Economic Council saying Saturday it would end up around 2 trillion only to later clarify that included the legislative package plus the leverage deployed through a Federal Reserve lending facility  Now however the legislative package alone has reached 2 trillion the people

{"7359": "In both his public remarks and through private prodding Trump has pushed for more good news on the pandemic and has insisted that even developments considered minor by health experts be expanded into major announcements for which he can claim credit And hes looking to the Food and Drug Administration for the biggest one Facing one of the most critical moments in its tenure since it was founded over a hundred years ago officials inside the FDA say the tension is palpable A number of sources familiar with the internal workings told CNN the responsibility feels immense and the environment is akin to that of a pressure cooker In the last week alone FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn was forced to apologize for an overhyped   subsequently   and found himself on the receiving end of criticism from the West Wing   Thats a distant cry from earlier this year when Hahn  the man Trump is now pressuring for a solution to the crisis  wasnt initially included on his coronavirus task force When Vice President Mike Pence added a second round of officials to the group Hahns name still wasnt listed It wasnt until five weeks after the group was formed that Hahn was named a formal task force member   Yet if Hahn was once relegated to the periphery six months later he finds himself squarely at the center of what officials and experts see as a fullon press to deliver a silver bullet that can end the crisis  and rescue the Presidents reelection bid  In meetings focused on vaccine development throughout the spring and summer Trump has consistently pressed officials to speed up their timeline for developing a vaccine administration officials said saying the President appeared intent on being able to deliver at least the solid promise of an effective vaccine by the time he faces reelection Those efforts have only scaled up as Election Day nears and Trump has repeatedly complained that some officials at federal health agencies are actively   his reelection chances by slowwalking announcements that might project forward momentum  It will be delivered before the end of the year in my opinion before the end of the year but it really might even be delivered before the end of October Trump said about a vaccine at a Pennsylvania rally Thursday night How do you like that Wouldnt that be nice And you know why Not because of the election Itd be nice because we want to save people On calendars peppered with early voting deadlines and presidential debates some of Trumps advisers have circled October 22 when a once obscure panel of academics and researchers convened by the FDA will weigh the development authorization andor licensure of a coronavirus vaccine  Its unlikely the meeting itself will result in a clear directive officials said and the board doesnt have final say on when or how a vaccine is approved But the public session could prove critical to achieving what some in Trumps orbit have dubbed the holy grail  a Covid vaccine by Election Day  Administration health officials continue to insist that no vaccine or treatment will be approved for use  either through full authorization or an emergency use designation  unless it is safe and effective No one is pressuring the FDA to do anything Trumps press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Thursday This President wants to break through regulatory barriers to get a vaccine as safely to the American people as quickly as possible because lives are at stake but he will not in any way sacrifice safety in making sure that this is 100 airtight before the American people receive it McEnany said In reality government officials and others familiar with the matter describe a more complicated situation where scientific fact is introduced into a fraught political season and where the President likens any effort to slow down or deny approval for his preferred remedies to a personal attack  The result has created enormous pressure on the agency that will ultimately determine when a vaccine is approved for use At some point the FDA will face a decision on authorizing emergency use of a vaccine before it is formally approved  a move Hahn has repeatedly said is on the table Many health experts both inside and outside the agency say they believe it is likely a vaccine will be approved for limited emergency use potentially for frontline health care workers some time in the next several months  Some officials inside the administration are concerned Hahn who is described by his colleagues as eager to please could bend to the intense political pressure coming from the West Wing   While the independent panel of experts who is meeting on October 22 will weigh in on a decision its advice is not binding Hahn has said the group will give us their guidance on any decision that we make but has not committed to following their lead  Some health experts fear that leaves open the possibility the White House will pressure Hahn and Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar to approve use of a vaccine before Election Day  The White House pushed back on the idea that politics has come before data Every decision the FDA has made during the Trump Administration has maintained the agencies sic gold standard for safety and been datadriven to save lives and this false narrative that the media and Democrats have created that politics is influencing approvals is not only false but is a danger to the American public White House spokesman Judd Deere told CNN in a statement President Trump believes all Americans should have access to proven safe and affordable treatment options and the rapid research development trials and scientific approvals are emblematic of President Trumps highest priority the health and safety of the American people Hahn has also denied hes under pressure I have been asked repeatedly whether there has been any inappropriate pressure on the FDA to make decisions that are not based on good data and good science I have repeatedly said that all FDA decisions have been and will continue to be based solely on good science and data The public can count on that commitment he wrote in a Washington Post   in August  Already the FDA has found itself making awkward and embarrassing reversals on coronavirus treatments following intense pressure from the President But its decision on a vaccine will prove to be the higheststakes move the FDA makes in recent memory  Earlier this summer under pressure from Trump and aides like trade adviser Peter Navarro the FDA approved an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine only to   less than two months later after a large study showed no evidence of benefit for mortality or other outcomes such as hospital length of stay or need for mechanical ventilation The President instead used his personal testimony to tout it even though he had not tested positive for coronavirus   Then Hahn was forced to apologize after receiving withering criticism from medical experts who said he oversold the lifesaving benefits of convalescent plasma during a briefing with Trump announcing it had been granted emergency approval Experts said more data was needed to make a determination and even some of Hahns colleagues did not agree with granting the emergency authorization Hahn said the decision was made based on data not politics   Hahns apology became a news cycle that spanned several days and irritated White House officials who had not cleared the mea culpa beforehand A person close to the situation said Hahn was torn between protecting his reputation among government scientists and West Wing staffers who believed Hahn had nothing to apologize for   It also resulted in the removal of a spokesperson who had been placed at the agency only days prior After announcing her arrival in a sunny memo   from her role as chief spokesperson after she played a role in helping him prepare for the briefing Because she was a political appointee put at the agency by the White House presidential personnel office led by Trumps former body man Hahn couldnt fire Miller outright She remains at the agency in an undefined role  The push for a vaccine has not been limited to the FDA Pressure is on at every agency to come up with new announcements over the next two months that could signal the pandemic is nearing an end  Officials say that although there has not been one explicit edict to provide coronavirus deliverables by Election Day the implications of the administrations message are clear Those involved in the various efforts say it is plainly evident that Trump and his advisers hope to convince voters the pandemic is ending by the time ballots are cast in November  Everyone wants this to be over by then or at least to be able to point to a finish line one official involved in the federal response said They dont have to spell it out  Other officials placed the push for a vaccine within the Trump administrations larger approach to the coronavirus pandemic which has been marked by intense pressure from the top to push optimistic assessments and potential cures even when the science is lacking  Theres not any more undue pressure now versus the way things have been working from the get go a federal health official told CNN Theres an urgency right now to get the vaccination program up and running  The Trump administration is planning for a number of vaccine scenarios according to the official which include the possibility of a vaccine as early as late November Other scenarios include a vaccine by early next year or even as late as the back half of 2021 the official said  Whether the United States will have a Covid19 vaccine by October remains unlikely but not impossible Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases told CNNs Jim Sciutto on Thursday  These are all guesstimates Fauci said   Still it is clear which scenario the President and his team have set their hopes on In his speech accepting the Republican National Convention Trump made the development of a vaccine the centerpiece of a short section on the pandemic vowing his administration will produce a vaccine before the end of the year or maybe even sooner  Among the Presidents political advisers a vaccine developed in time for use by November 3 has been referred to alternately as the ultimate October surprise and the Holy Grail for the Presidents reelection prospects which have suffered badly amid the pandemic and ensuing economic contraction  As far back as the beginning of August senior leaders at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to start helping states with vaccine plans including a plan on how to help schools CNN previously reported that the agency was expected to come up with a vaccine plan for schools in at least four states by October according to a senior CDC official  In a letter this week the CDC told public health officials around the United States to prepare to    days before Election Day The documents do not necessarily mean a vaccine will be available in that timeframe and National Institutes of Health Director Dr Francis Collins said he did not interpret the letter to mean the CDC was preparing to jump the gun on a vaccine  The likelihood of that is pretty low Collins told CNN This is like the Boy Scout motto Be Prepared Still the revelation set off another round of worried criticism that the vaccine process may be politicized Too much of the evidence points to the Trump administration pressuring the FDA to approve a vaccine by Election Day to boost the Presidents reelection campaign Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Thursday  The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials on Thursday called on federal leadership to make safety and not politics a priority when considering the timeline of distributing a Covid19 vaccine in the United States  and to require the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials   The safety and efficacy of vaccines is paramount to protecting the health of the American public and to building confidence in our state and territorial immunization programs Dr Rachel Levine president of ASTHO said in a statement  Three vaccine makers have entered phase three clinical trials and one  Pfizer  said on Thursday it should have enough data to know if its product works by the end of October The pharmaceutical giants Chairman and CEO Dr Albert Bourla said the ongoing clinical trial for a Covid19 vaccine has enrolled about 23000 participants and some are already getting the second dose of the vaccine   Pfizer should be able to have enough events to say if the product works or not by the end of October Bourla said speaking to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations We have already worked on the rest of the file he said meaning if the vaccine is effective we are going to start submitting to the FDA While Trump has placed phone calls to some drug industry heads for updates on their progress including the CEO of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals which is developing an antibody treatment his current relationship with the pharmaceutical industry is contentious While he has repeatedly claimed that major drug executives are coming to the White House for a meeting to discuss a drug pricing initiative he has spearheaded the industrys chiefs have denied anything is on the books   Jared Kushner the Presidents soninlaw and senior adviser has taken an active role in the administrations vaccine development effort including in helping select Moncef Slaoui the former pharmaceutical executive to lead Operation Warp Speed  Officials who have participated in Operation Warp Speed meetings held regularly at the headquarters of the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington say the election has not been specifically mentioned by representatives from the White House which have sometimes included Kushner  But Kushner and his allies have pressed the team to work quickly to develop the vaccine His message along with others close to the President is that the lengthy timeline used to develop previous vaccines is unacceptable this time around given the dire effects the virus has had on Americans health and the US economy  Trump has complained this summer that career officials in his own government are working against him predicting they would purposely avoid announcing a vaccine until after Election Day Decrying a deep state intent on ousting him Trump has asked officials in the White House to ensure people who are loyal to him are overseeing the vaccine efforts people familiar with the conversations said Sources say Trump has at times blamed the FDA commissioner for this and described career health experts like Fauci as people he inherited  Concerned the FDA was being overly cautious in its public messaging the White House installed Miller as its chief spokesperson The move which came as a surprise to many inside the FDA was viewed by some career employees as an attempt to exert more political control over the administrations health efforts  Trump had previously complained bitterly to aides about some of the FDAs actions during the pandemic namely its reversal of authorization for hydroxychloroquine the antimalarial that is not proven to treat coronavirus   Inside the West Wing some officials have claimed that scientists working at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health are actively working to stymie Trumps efforts toward developing treatments and a vaccine in order to diminish his chances of reelection When word arrived at the White House last month that the FDA was preparing to issue an emergency use authorization on convalescent plasma for treating coronavirus officials quickly decided that Trump himself should announce it rather than issuing a more standard statement from the agency That caught some health officials by surprise because they did not view the authorization as a major development But after a series of phone calls between Trumps aides and FDA leadership it was decided that Hahn would come to the White House briefing room to join Trump for the announcement  even though some other administration health officials including Fauci and his boss at the NIH Collins  had raised concerns about it Generally NIH is not involved in decisionmaking at the FDA according to what Dr Anand Shah the FDAs deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs told CNN in midAugust  What resulted was an embarrassing debacle Nearly as soon as Trump and Hahn had delivered the announcement during a muchheralded briefing questions began to emerge about their claims of efficacy Hahn ultimately apologized for mischaracterizing how effective plasma treatment is known to be One medical expert in the administration described his comments as embarrassingly incorrect And this week a panel of NIH experts said in a statement There are currently no data from wellcontrolled adequately powered randomized clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID19 If the EUA on plasma is ultimately reversed it would mark another embarrassment for the FDA"},

resources to the global fight against coronavirus  But there are a number of potential hurdles ahead as lawmakers scramble to take steps to respond to the disease  To start Schumers request sets up a possible fight with the administration which earlier this week requested 25 billion and only 125 billion of it is new funding The White House and Senate Democrats are at least 6 billion apart when it comes to determining how much funding the federal government needs to combat the coronavirus epidemic Soon after Schumer proposed an 85 billion package a senior Trump administration official told CNN that the administration is very confident that its request for 125 billion in new emergency funds as part of a 25 billion total package will be sufficient to fund the US coronavirus response Its not just Democrats however who are calling the Trump administrations funding request insufficient Republican Sen Richard Shelby the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee said Tuesday that he worried that administration was lowballing the request One issue that officials are confronting at the moment is determining exactly how much funding is needed Capitol Hill sources told CNN that the Trump administration has already indicated that they know they will need more money down the line than initially requested  The fivepart request from Schumer includes 15 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention including for the Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund and Global Health Security 3 billion for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund 2 billion set aside for state and local reimbursements 1 billion for the USAIDs Emergency Reserve Fund and 1 billion for the National Institutes of Healths Vaccine Development program  Then theres the question of what House appropriators will do  and whether the House and the Senate will be in alignment  A House Democratic aide told CNN that they are still assessing what amount of funding is needed because of a lack of information from President Donald Trumps administration   Bipartisan bicameral meetings to work out the details of the coronavirus supplemental funding will begin today The strong desire of all four corners is to assemble a bill that robustly funds pandemic response and can earn bipartisan support the aide said The request from the minority leader comes as fears of the coronavirus and

{"3638": "In countries such as Italy men represent nearly 60 of people who tested positive for the virus and more than 70 of those who have died according to the countrys National Health Institute ISS Even in countries like South Korea where the proportion of women who have tested positive for the virus is higher than that of men about 54 of the reported deaths are among men  But while health officials are starting to take note of these staggering numbers the United States is not releasing the basic nationwide data that is crucial to understanding who is most vulnerable to the virus according to a CNN analysis  Dr Deborah Birx the White Houses coronavirus response coordinator said at a White House press briefing on Friday From Italy were seeing another concerning trend That the mortality in males seems to be twice in every age group of females Regarding this data on Italy Birx said in an interview with CNNs Wolf Blitzer Just having the knowledge of that helps us in the United States so we can be very specific in talking to the American people about who to protect and how to protect them  CNN has reached out to Birx for additional comment When CNN asked the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for data split by sex for US cases of coronavirus and deaths by coronavirus known as sexdisaggregated data the CDC did not respond  Comprehensive data about those who have gotten sick could help inform more effective responses to the crisis But public health researchers say that when governments such as the United States either dont collect or dont publish their data its impossible for experts to gain an accurate sense of whats going on  In collaboration with   a research institute examining gender inequality in global health CNN analyzed the   with the highest number of confirmed cases of Covid19 at the time of data collection  March 20 The aim was to see why men seem to be dying more than women From these 20 countries only six provided data broken down by sex for both confirmed cases and deaths  China France Germany Iran Italy and South Korea A further seven provided such data for the number of confirmed cases only No sexdisaggregated data could be located for the remaining countries The research has been submitted for publication and has not yet been peerreviewed The data is not comprehensive in all cases For example the figures for China only cover the period through the end of February well before community spread approached zero And no reliable data exists on the proportion of tests administered to men versus women in any country Furthermore there are undoubtedly cases of the virus that are not reflected in the national data for any country But across the countries for which we have data  spanning nearly a quarter of the worlds population  we found that men were 50 more likely than women to die after being diagnosed with Covid19 While necessarily partial and incomplete the results highlight what public health experts have been warning for some time theorizing that it is not only biology but also gendered behaviors  the different ways in which men and women conduct their lives  which may play a significant role in the different mortality rate for respiratory diseases  When we look at the data what were seeing is that in every country with sexdisaggregated data  there is between a 10 and 90 higher rate of mortality amongst people diagnosed with Covid if they are men compared to if they are women says Sarah Hawkes professor of global public health at University College London UCL and codirector of Global Health 5050  If I was designing clinical guidelines I would very much want to understand why some people seem to have a much higher risk of mortality than others It might for example lead to a difference in the way in which we administer clinical guidelines amongst people who have preexisting health conditions that lead to risk of death along with those with chronic lung disease who are more likely to be men Hawkes also noted that reporting sexdisaggregated data on epidemics has been requested by the World Health Organization since 2007 but many countries fail to do so As the US data was not publicly available on a national level CNN went state by state to request the data but many did not release it Even states such as New York and California where the outbreak is particularly severe did not provide CNN with the requested data despite several attempts In some cases CNN located the data in press releases from local counties care homes and hospitals  Im pretty sure that in a country with the sophistication of the health system and the surveillance system that the United States has that its not that theres an absence of data says Hawkes  I am fairly sure that down to the smallest districts across the US people have the data What weve not seeing happening it seems is a collation a collection of that data at state and national level with the speed which one might hope to see from the perspective of global health research Historically coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS tended to affect men disproportionately according to Dr Luis OstroskyZeichner infectious disease specialist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Texas  During previous epidemics males were reported to have a worse clinical outcome   in Hong Kong They also had a higher risk of dying from MERS in  From an evolutionary perspective some research suggests that women have a stronger immune response against viral infections than men because they spend part of their lives with a foreign body inside  their offspring  thus granting them a survival advantage It might have to do with hormonal changes OstroskyZeichner said There is actual research in animals that has shown there may be a biological basis for the sort of increasing susceptibility in the male gender and not only that but also an increased severity and response to the virus  Initial reports of people with severe Covid19 disease have found that they were likely to have underlying health conditions such as hypertension cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease according to Global Health 5050 These conditions tend to be more common among men in the six countries analyzed as well as globally the institute said possibly because of riskier lifestyle choices  If Covid19 is following the same kind of patterns that we see across a range of other diseases what we know is that men tend to have across their life courses  greater risks of exposure to behaviors that will lead to adverse health outcomes in the long term says Hawkes  So in most countries for example what we see is that men smoke tobacco and drink alcohol at far greater rates than women do she said  Smoking is a clear example of how such behavior differs between men and women  China has the   with around 316 million adult smokers But while over 50 of Chinese men smoke less than 3 of women do according to the  In Italy 7 million men smoke as opposed to the 45 million women according to 2020 data released by the National Health Institute ISS The institute   that upon admission to hospital a third more Covid19positive smokers had a more serious clinical situation than nonsmokers  For these smokers the risk of needing intensive care and mechanical ventilation is more than double If youve got a group of men who have been smokers in their lifetime and then get it Covid19 and now have chronic lung disease as a result of the smoking and then get exposed to corona infection it seems as if they are more likely to suffer from severe corona infection and be at risk of death Hawkes said  Other studies have shown that Italian men also have higher rates of   than agematched females while Chinese men tend to have   and are more likely to have Type 2 diabetes  All these factors contribute to possible complications if they get the coronavirus researchers say  But the lack of data on how many men died of novel coronavirus as opposed to women Global Health 5050 researchers say feels like a missed opportunity for governments to implement public health policies that target certain groups of people who are significantly more vulnerable than the rest of the population What Covid19 reveals is a classic case of failing to use data for decision making For every patient there is a record of their sex But that data is not collated and analyzed with a gender lens Dr Kent Buse cofounder of GH5050 and chief of strategic policy directions at UNAIDS told CNN The same view is shared by Arthur Caplan a bioethicist at New York University All data establishing risk ability to recover infectivity is crucial in a pandemic he told CNN Data ought to be collected transparent as to methods and disseminated promptly For as long as this data is not made publicly available it cannot be analyzed by outside experts like Global Health 5050 for clues on why men seem to be dying more from Covid19 "},

made clear Kushner was wrong As of early Friday morning the stockpiles home page had   Strategic National Stockpile is the nations largest supply of lifesaving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out When state local tribal and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency Organized for scalable response to a variety of public health threats this repository contains enough supplies to respond to multiple largescale emergencies simultaneously These sentences were gone as of Friday afternoon In their place were new sentences that emphasized that the stockpile is meant as a temporary backup for states own supplies The revised page   The Strategic National Stockpiles role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies Many states have products stockpiled as well The supplies medicines and devices for lifesaving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a shortterm stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available The Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response ASPR which manages the stockpile would not comment on the record Speaking on condition of anonymity a spokesperson said that the edit had been in the works before Kushners remarks This is language we have been using in responding to inquiries for weeks now ASPR first began working to update the website text a week ago to more clearly explain to state and local agencies and members of the public the role of the SNS the spokesperson said  Jeremy Konyndyk who served under former President Barack Obama as director of the US Agency for International Developments Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance told CNN before the edit that the original home page could not be a more literal refutation of Jareds claim He called the edit absolutely Orwellian Republican Sen Cory Gardner of Colorado sent a   to the inspector general of Health and Human Services on Thursday requesting an investigation into mismanagement being reported about the stockpiles supply of ventilators Gardner told Politico that the letter was not a response to Kushners comment but he also questioned the comment  I dont know what Kushner was talking about what he meant Gardner   to Politico noting that the stockpile is for the

name the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile The mission was to assemble large quantities of essential medical supplies that could be delivered to states and communities during an emergency within 12 hours of the federal decision to use the stockpile  Konyndyk said in an email that Kushners Thursday remark shows a total misunderstanding of the purpose of the SNS but more broadly shows a misunderstanding of how federal disaster response operates Most federal disaster support operates on the model that stateslocals lead in assessing need defining requirements and executing response operations The federal level supports them in that providing resources coordination expertise logistics etc as required Thats FEMAs basic operating model and its how the SNS is supposed to operate as

earlier than previously known Pretty amazing Trump told Woodward adding that the coronavirus was maybe five times more deadly than the flu   Trumps admissions are in stark contrast to his frequent public comments at the time insisting that the virus was going to disappear and all work out fine   The book using Trumps own words depicts a President who has betrayed the public trust and the most fundamental responsibilities of his office In Rage Trump says the job of a president is to keep our country safe But in early February Trump told Woodward he knew how deadly the virus was and in March admitted he kept that knowledge hidden from the public   I wanted to always play it down Trump told Woodward on March 19 even as he had   a national emergency over the virus days earlier I still like playing it down because I dont want to create a panic       If instead of playing down what he knew Trump had acted decisively in early February with a strict shutdown and a consistent message to wear masks social distance and wash hands   that thousands of American lives could have been saved The startling revelations in Rage which CNN obtained ahead of its September 15 release were made during 18 wideranging interviews Trump gave Woodward from December 5 2019 to July 21 2020 The interviews were recorded by Woodward with Trumps permission and CNN has obtained copies of some of the audio tapes     Rage also includes   from many of his former top national security officials including former Defense Secretary James Mattis former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Mattis is quoted as calling Trump dangerous and unfit to be commander in chief Woodward writes that Coats continued to harbor the secret belief one that had grown rather than lessened although unsupported by intelligence proof that Putin had something on Trump Woodward continues writing that Coats felt How else to explain the presidents behavior Coats could see no other explanation The book also contains harsh evaluations of the Presidents leadership on the virus from current officials               Dr Anthony Fauci the administrations top infectious disease expert is quoted telling others Trumps leadership was rudderless and that his attention span is like a minus number    His sole purpose is to get reelected Fauci told an associate according to Woodward  Fauci responded to the quotes in a Fox News interview on Wednesday saying he would question the account   If you notice others have said that You know you should ask others I dont recall that at all Fauci said adding that he didnt get any sense Trump was distorting things   Trump responded to the Woodward book at a White House event Wednesday afternoon defending his response to the pandemic and confirming he did not want to create a panic   Well I think if you said in order to reduce panic perhaps thats so Trump said The fact is Im a cheerleader for this country I love our country And I dont want people to be frightened I dont want to create panic as you say and certainly Im not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy We want to show confidence We want to show strength      Woodward reveals new details on the early warnings Trump received  and often ignored    In a January 28 top secret intelligence briefing national security adviser Robert OBrien gave Trump a jarring warning about the virus telling the President it would be the biggest national security threat of his presidency Trumps head popped up Woodward writes   OBriens deputy Matt Pottinger concurred telling Trump it could be as bad as the influenza pandemic of 1918 which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide including 675000 Americans Pottinger warned Trump that asymptomatic spread was occurring in China He had been told 50 of those infected showed no symptoms   At that time there were fewer than a dozen reported coronavirus cases in the US   Three days later Trump announced restrictions on travel from China a move suggested by his national security team  despite Trumps   that he alone backed the travel limitations    Nevertheless Trump continued to publicly downplay the danger of the virus February   Woodward views this as a damning missed opportunity for Trump to reset the leadership clock after he was told this was a onceinalifetime health emergency    Presidents are the executive branch There was a duty to warn To listen to plan and to take care Woodward writes But in the days following the January 28 briefing Trump used highprofile appearances to minimize the threat and Woodward writes to reassure the public they faced little risk   During a preSuper Bowl interview on Fox News February 2 Trump said We pretty much shut it down coming in from China Two days later during his   Trump made only a passing reference to the virus promising my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat Asked by Woodward in May if he remembered OBriens January 28 warning that the virus would be the biggest national security threat of his presidency Trump equivocated No I dont Trump said Im sure if he said it — you know Im sure he said it Nice guy   The book highlights how the President took all of the credit and none of the responsibility for his actions related to the pandemic which has infected 6 million Americans and killed more than 185000 in the US   The virus has nothing to do with me Trump told Woodward in their final interview in July Its not my fault Its — China let the damn virus out     When Woodward spoke to Trump on February 7 two days after he was acquitted on impeachment charges by the Senate Woodward expected a lengthy conversation about the trial He was surprised however by the Presidents focus on the virus At the same time that Trump and his public health officials were saying the virus was low risk Trump divulged to Woodward that the night before hed spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping about the virus Woodward quotes Trump as saying Weve got a little bit of an interesting setback with the virus going in China   It goes through the air Trump said Thats always tougher than the touch You dont have to touch things Right But the air you just breathe the air and thats how its passed And so thats a very tricky one Thats a very delicate one Its also more deadly than even your strenuous flus    But Trump spent most of the next month saying that the virus was very much under control and that cases in the US would   Trump said on his trip to India on February 25 that it was a problem thats going to go away and the next day he predicted the number of US cases within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero    By March 19 when Trump told Woodward he was purposely downplaying the dangers to avoid creating a panic he also acknowledged the threat to young people Just today and yesterday some startling facts came out Its not just old older Young people too plenty of young people Trump said   Publicly however Trump has continued to insist just the opposite saying as recently as August 5 that children were     Even into April when the US became the country with the most confirmed cases in the world Trumps public statements contradicted his acknowledgements to Woodward At an April 3 coronavirus task force briefing Trump was   and stating that it would go away I said its going away and it is going away he said Yet two days later on April 5 Trump again told Woodward Its a horrible thing Its unbelievable and on April 13 he said Its so easily transmissible you wouldnt even believe it     Woodward a twotime Pulitzer Prize winner conducted hundreds of hours of confidential background interviews with firsthand witnesses for Rage and he obtained notes emails diaries calendars and confidential documents including more than two dozen   Woodward is known to record his interviews with the permission of his subjects and sources    He writes that when he attributes exact quotations thoughts or conclusions that information comes either from the person a colleague with direct knowledge or documents     Trumps conscious downplaying of the coronavirus is one of numerous revelations in Rage The book is filled with anecdotes about top Cabinet officials blindsided by tweets frustrated with Trumps inability to focus and scared about his next policy directive because he refused to accept facts or listen to experts      Mattis is quoted as saying Trump is dangerous unfit has no moral compass and took foreign policy actions that showed adversaries how to destroy America After Mattis left the administration he and Coats discussed whether they needed to take collective action to speak out publicly against Trump Mattis says he ultimately resigned after Trump announced he was withdrawing US troops from Syria when I was basically directed to do something that I thought went beyond stupid to felony stupid     Woodward writes that Coats and his top staff members examined the intelligence as carefully as possible and that Coats still questions the relationship between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin Coats saw how extraordinary it was for the presidents top intelligence official to harbor such deep suspicions about the presidents relationship with Putin But he could not shake them   Trump has come under fire in recent days for reportedly   about US military personnel and veterans Woodwards book includes an anecdote where an aide to Mattis heard Trump say in a meeting my fing generals are a bunch of pussies because they cared more about alliances than trade deals Mattis asked the aide to document the comment in an email to him And Trump himself criticized military officials to Woodward over their view that alliances with NATO and South Korea are the best bargain the US makes I wouldnt say they were stupid because I would never say that about our military people Trump said But if they said that they  whoever said that was stupid Its a horrible bargain  they make so much money Costs us 10 billion Were suckers    Woodward reports that Trumps national security team expressed concerns the US may have come close to nuclear war with North Korea amid provocations in 2017 We never knew whether it was real Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is quoted as saying or whether it was a bluff But it was so serious that Mattis slept in his clothes to be ready in case there was a North Korean launch and repeatedly went to the Washington National Cathedral to pray      Trump boasted to Woodward about a new secret weapons system I have built a nuclear — a weapons system that nobodys ever had in this country before Trump said Woodward says other sources confirmed the information without providing further details but expressed surprise that Trump disclosed it    Woodward obtained the 27 love letters Trump exchanged with Kim Jong Un 25 of which have not been reported publicly The letters filled with flowery language provide a fascinating window into their relationship Kim flatters Trump by repeatedly calling him Your Excellency and writes in one letter that meeting again would be reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film In another Kim writes that the deep and special friendship between us will work as a magical force CNN has obtained the       Trumps soninlaw and senior White House adviser   with some unusual literary insights about his fatherinlaw Kushner is quoted as saying that four texts are key to understanding Trump including Alice in Wonderland Kushner paraphrased the Cheshire Cat If you dont know where youre going any path will get you there     Woodward pressed Trump on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmans role in the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi Once again Trump dismissed the US intelligence assessment and defends bin Salman He says very strongly that he didnt do it  Trump insulted his predecessors saying Woodward made former President George W Bush look like a stupid moron which he was Trump said of former President Barack Obama I dont think Obamas smart  I think hes highly overrated And I dont think hes a great speaker He also tells Woodward that Kim Jong Un thought Obama was an asshole    Woodward discussed the Black Lives Matter protests and suggested to the President that people like the two of them  White privileged  need to work to understand the anger and pain that Black people feel in the US You really drank the KoolAid didnt you Just listen to you Trump responded repeating his outrageous talking point that hes done more for the Black community than any president besides Abraham Lincoln     Woodward reports new details on Russias election meddling writing that the NSA and CIA have classified evidence the Russians had placed malware in the election registration systems of at least two Florida counties St Lucie and Washington While there was no evidence the malware had been activated Woodward writes it was sophisticated and could erase voters in specific districts The voting system vendor used by Florida was also used in states across the country      Rage is a followup to Woodwards 2018 bestselling book Fear which portrayed a chaotic White House in which aides hid papers from Trump to protect the country from what they viewed as his most dangerous impulses   While Trump slammed Fear he also complained that he didnt speak to Woodward for the book which resulted in his agreeing to extensive interviews for Rage    However on August 14 Trump preemptively attacked Woodwards new book tweeting The Bob Woodward book will be a FAKE as always just as many of the others have been     Throughout the book Trump provides insights into his view of the presidency He tells Woodward when youre running

every single day of the number of Americans who have lost their lives to this virus We dont lose that many Americans to a virus like the flu virus every year Birx said during a media appearance in Minnesota Knowledge about the importance of masks and social distancing has increased over the past six months she said This really needs to be a balanced message of We have power against this virus but it requires all of us to exert our power together  Birx said that people need to ensure they are taking their public mitigation efforts home with them when necessary Across the country experts have seen that people sometimes make assumptions when gathering in private that there couldnt be anybody that has infection there Birx said Because of this they dont wear masks when interacting which leads to the virus spreading among family members and neighbors Were doing a much better job in public in our public mitigations We have to take those home to private and ensure were also doing that

Presidents unusually serious demeanor and the ominous curve charts of his top public health officials struck a note of alarm missing from Trumps previous knockabout briefings The stark spectacle of a president especially one who spent weeks dismissing the virus warning of the imminent demise of so many Americans encapsulated the scale of the crisis I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead Were going to go through a very tough two weeks the President said in the White House briefing room Trumps briefing mostly lacked the elements of selfcongratulation and false hope that have characterized his heavily criticized leadership in the crisis To begin with during his marathon twohour briefing he mostly ceded the stage to his credible lieutenants Dr   and Dr   who

agony reflecting the wrenching substance of their message But in order to keep deaths to the lower end of their estimates they warned that maximum mitigation efforts  including physical distancing and staying at home  were imperative Even with such a regime in place across the country  and some states and cities are not yet taking the advice seriously  there are likely to be between 100000 and

addresses  Thats all I can say Trump said before walking into the White House Grossly incompetent Between Friday and Monday Trump tweeted or retweeted about Obama 19 times and seemed prepared to continue his assault His lines of attack fell into two categories the former presidents preparation for global pandemics  which Trump has claimed was woefully inadequate  and the asyetunspecified criminality which appears to center on claims of sinister attempts to derail Trumps campaign and presidency The unprecedented animus between the sitting and former presidents  who have met in person only once since parting ways on Inauguration Day in 2017  is poised to become a running thruline of the next fiveandahalf months as Trump seeks to move on from a deadly pandemic and battles Biden for reelection Attorney General William Barrs declaration Monday that neither Obama nor Biden is likely to be charged by his department as part of an investigation into the origin of the Russia probe only highlighted how much Trump will likely lean on his allies in Congress to advance his conspiracy As long as Im attorney general the criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends Barr said at a news conference adding Not every abuse of power is a federal crime Later in the day Trump said he was surprised by Barrs comments I think if it was me they would do it the President said during a meeting of restaurant executives who had been summoned to the White House to discuss their cratering industry Obama who has steadfastly avoided getting into drawnout arguments with his successor waded in more directly to the fray on Saturday evening when he delivered a pair of televised commencement addresses that were broadcast nationally The mere fact Obama was invited to participate in the event  designed to give graduating seniors a commencement experience when their inperson events were canceled  was bound to irritate Trump who was not involved Trump will deliver a commencement address next month at the US Military Academy West Point but unlike Obama he wasnt urged in online petitions for a major national address In his remarks Obama did not name Trump But his assessment of how the coronavirus has been handled in the United States was scathing nonetheless and carried clear rebukes of the current President All those adults that you used to think were in charge and knew what they were doing It turns out that they dont have all the answers Obama said during a primetime special for high school seniors which was aired on major broadcast and cable television networks A lot of them arent even asking the right questions So if the worlds going to get better its going to be up to you  In remarks earlier in the day to graduates of historically black colleges and universities Obama again did not name Trump But his rebuke of how the current President has handled the worst public health crisis in a generation was plain More than anything this pandemic has fully finally tore back the curtain on the idea that so many of folks in charge know what there doing And some of them are not even pretending to be in charge Obama said While delivering a piece of advice in the second set of remarks he attacked socalled grownups for why things are so screwed up Though the subject of Obamas criticism went unspoken it was obvious to many listeners that he was talking about Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany responded by insisting Trumps unprecedented coronavirus response has saved lives and that he was left to fill the stockpile left depleted by his predecessor  a claim CNN has repeatedly   Over the past week Trump has repeatedly invoked Obama as he looks to defend his own handling of the coronavirus pandemic Trump spent weeks downplaying the severity of the virus the federal governments response was hampered by delays in testing and gaps in supply chains for equipment and supplies and last week the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the US death toll would pass 100000 by the start of June The uneven federal response paired with skyrocketing unemployment has led to concerns about Trumps political standing among Republican operatives and officials Trump has sought to turn the page by encouraging states to lift stayathome orders hoping for an economic rebound by Novembers election But he has also sought to divert blame for the crisis on the previous administration turning the crisis into a referendum on how prepared Obama and Biden were for such a pandemic  despite Trump having been in office for more than three years when the virus struck Using   claims hes also repeatedly harkened to the previous administrations handling of the H1N1 swine flu  despite a drastically higher death toll from coronavirus Obama administration officials have rejected the claims and pointed to the various pandemic preparation plans they left the incoming administration in 2017 And Obama himself has taken to tweeting articles and studies about the pandemic that encourage staid scientific judgment over politically tinged decisionmaking Trump meanwhile has added additional conspiracies into the mix as he looks to undermine Obama and Bidens administration For years Trump has claimed without proof that Democratic partisans within the Justice Department and the FBI abused their powers to investigate members of his campaign and undermine his presidency His latest claims against Obama appear to be an extension of the same underlying theory which is part of the Presidents sustained effort to rewrite the history of the Russia investigation There is no evidence that Obama directed any action by the FBI against Trumps campaign before the 2016 election but Trump has fanned the flames of that conspiracy since at least 2017 when he tweeted that Obama had my wires tapped an accusations that people familiar with the matter said enraged the former president Trump raised the unfounded claims at various intervals over the past three years but has amplified them anew as the pandemic continues to rage and his political standing seems threatened Trump has encouraged friendly lawmakers to take steps to advance the claims including by demanding Obama appear before their committees If I were a Senator or Congressman the first person I would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the USA by FAR is former President Obama Trump wrote on Twitter last week He knew EVERYTHING At Camp David this weekend Trump was joined by several lawmakers who gained prominence by their aggressive support of him during House impeachment hearings — including Republican Reps Jim Jordan of Ohio Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin of New York Devin Nunes of California and Matt Gaetz of Florida along with his new chief of staff Mark Meadows and his wife Debbie As he returned to the White House Trump did not say how he might work to advance his

affect global supply chains but the new outbreaks in two major economies  Italy and South Korea  have rattled markets and dashed hopes of a speedy recovery sparking this weeks worldwide stock rout  South Korean authorities are attempting to contain an outbreak that has gone from just   to at least 1260 as of Wednesday The outbreak began in the southern city of Daegu and was centered around the Shincheonji religious group but the virus appears to have spread now beyond practitioners Twenty members of the South Korean military have been confirmed infected and the countrys defense ministry has placed significant restrictions on soldiers leaving their bases due to fears surrounding the virus On Wednesday it was announced that a US service member stationed in South Korea tested positive for the virus according to US Forces Korea statement  The soldier who is stationed at Camp Carroll which is approximately 20 kilometers 124 miles from the city of Daegu is the first US service member to

mishandled the regions first coronavirus case and had contributed to the deadly virus spread The cases are heavily concentrated in the region of Lombardy where 212 infections have been confirmed Around 100000 people in Lombardy and nearby Veneto are facing travel and other restrictions Conte on Monday night said that the hospital that treated the first coronavirus case in Codogno known as Patient 1 had not followed protocol Conte did not elaborate on what protocols were breached It was clear there has been a management of the hospital not entirely proper according to prudent protocols which are recommended in these cases and this has certainly contributed to the spread he said Italian authorities have identified Patient 1 as a 38yearold man giving only the name Mattia Mattia was originally in intensive care for respiratory problems at a hospital in Codogno but is now being treated at the Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia about 35 kilometers 217 miles south of Milan Italian

the ways his administration is confronting a spreading coronavirus outbreak according to people familiar with the conversations Publicly he has expressed optimism that the virus is going to go away Lawmakers in Congress meanwhile have voiced concerns that more needs to be done  that the Trump administrations response has exposed vulnerabilities Looking ahead we should be passing laws to make sure we have that manufacturing capability that we have sufficient stockpiles You know things expire We need to be far more strategic about how we approach these things for the next potential pandemic Republican Sen Ron Johnson said These are serious issues Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was quick to criticize China and Iran accusing both countries of a lack of transparency He also alleged that attempts by both governments to stifle dissent has played a part in the virus spread  Had China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge Pompeo said  The WHO has continually praised Chinas response to the crisis   the relationship between the two

Iran to Chinese tariffs Trump continued to be dishonest on the critical subject of coronavirus testing wrongly claiming he inherited faulty tests  they were developed this year during his presidency  and painting an overly rosy picture of the US testing situation He also repeated several of the false claims he likes to make at his campaign rallies Heres a rundown of the claims and the facts  Trump continued to favorably compare the coronavirus testing situation in the US to the situation in other countries He alleged that Democratic governors are deliberately not using testing capacity the federal government has created  and suggested that the only governors complaining about testing challenges are Democrats Now theyre giving you the other  its called testing testing But they dont want to use all of the capacity that weve created We have tremendous capacity  they know that the governors know that The Democrat governors know that Theyre the ones that are complaining he said Republican Ohio Gov Mike DeWine and his health chief   that testing at hospitals in the state was being impeded by a shortage of critical components  Republican Maryland Gov Larry Hogan   on Thursday that he believes Maryland is going to get in the next several weeks to the level of testing needed but he also said This has been the No 1 stumbling block in America the lack of availability of testing and you really cant get to any point where you can reopen the country until not just in my state but across the country until we can do much much largerscale testing  Republican Nebraska Gov Pete Ricketts   that it has been a challenge to get all of the supplies needed to conduct tests Peter Iwen director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory   in a story published Wednesday that supplies they need to run tests were being sent instead to labs in other states Were trying to compete with those people and were just not getting the reagents sent to us  Democratic governors are expressing concerns similar to those of their Republican colleagues  Democratic Kansas Gov Laura Kelly   We have had a very difficult time getting access to tests and all the stuff you need to complete those tests  There are not enough tests being performed on any group anywhere in the state okay Democratic New York Gov Andrew Cuomo   There are not enough tests being performed in Buffalo Rochester Syracuse Albany North Country Long Island Westchester not for prisoners not for the black and brown population not for health care workers not for police officers thats true across the board Thats why we have to bring testing to scale across the board  During the briefing Saturday afternoon Trump repeated one of his goto falsehoods that he often uses to defend his administrations fumbled response to the coronavirus pandemic In speaking to the leaders of other countries this morning they said this is incredible the way youve done this so quickly Trump said without naming any foreign officials You know were only talking about a few weeks since everybody knew this was such a big problem     We most recently   which means Trump has repeated this false claim twice in his last three press conferences at the White House That factcheck pointed out that in claiming nobody foresaw the pandemic Trump is brushing aside warnings he received from the World Health Organization and US intelligence agencies The virus emerged in China in December  While in January the World Health Organization WHO declared a public health emergency Trump spent much of January and February   the dangers and   that were out of step with federal public health authorities who alerted the public with increasing alarm that the virus was approaching On March 11 the WHO   a global pandemic and by the end of the month the number of reported cases in the US had skyrocketed past 100000  CNN   when Trump made a similar comment multiple times in one week of briefings That article highlighted years of warnings from pandemic experts and even officials who worked in Trumps administration who basically said the clock was ticking until the next pandemic in the US and that the country probably wouldnt be ready At Saturdays briefing President Trump repeated his claim that he inherited a bare cupboard of medical supplies to fight coronavirus from the Obama administration We started off with a broken system We inherited a broken terrible system And I always say it our cupboards were bare We had very little in our stockpile Now were loaded up   The Strategic National Stockpile was not empty before the coronavirus pandemic For example the stockpile contains enough smallpox vaccines for every American among other medical resources However critical supplies that could be used to combat coronavirus were drained and not replenished  Ultimately Trump ignored the warnings of experts and failed to restock masks and prepare other supplies to fight a potential pandemic You can read a full fact check on this   including how former President Barack Obama was criticized for failing to restock the national stockpile  Speaking about testing for the coronavirus Trump said I inherited broken junk This is a claim he has made multiple times and which we have   multiple times as well    He is lying He is lying 100 He is lying because he is trying to shift blame to others even if the attempt is totally nonsensical Gregg Gonsalves an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases at the Yale School of Public Health said of an earlier version of this Trump claim The claim doesnt make sense because it is false Tara Smith an epidemiology professor at Kent State University said of an earlier version This is a new virus Michael Mina assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health called an earlier version of the claim absurd given that this virus did not exist in the prior administration In addition to claiming President Obama left him with a depleted stockpile of medical supplies Trump said Obama left him with no ammunition If you remember when I first came in we didnt have ammunition Trump said Not a good way to fight a war President Obama left us no ammunition OK In the past the President has attributed this claim to an unnamed general While we dont know what a general might have told him in private you can read a full fact check of Trumps claims about munitions levels    Trump also repeated several other falsehoods hes made in the past on topics unrelated to the pandemic He claimed that as part of the Iran nuclear deal the US agreed to give Iran 150 billion dollars   The sum in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions not US government money  and experts say the total was significantly lower than 150 billion You can read a fuller fact check   He also doubleddown on the idea that China is providing the US several billion dollars in tariffs arguing that the Chinese not Americans are paying the tariffs on imported Chinese products    Trump also alleged that President Obama wanted a relationship with the North Korean leader but that Kim Jong Un refused to meet with him   "},

done many more tests than other countries ignoring the fact that many peer nations did so much better controlling the virus that they havent needed to keep conducting so many tests He continued to say that the virus will disappear declining to acknowledge the inaccuracy of his previous suggestions that it would disappear without much harm to the American public  or the possibility that it will take years for the virus to be eradicated if it goes away at all And Trump repeated some of the specific false claims we and others fact checked repeatedly in earlier stages of the crisis his claim that he inherited   of supplies and ventilators that he   to China and Europe and that governors   from the federal government He also repeated   nonpandemicrelated lies that he is the one who got the

false claims Since CNN started counting on July 8 2019 Trump has repeated that claim more than 60 times  The President tried to shift blame for his administrations delayed response to the coronavirus

supply chain Whether its ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need    The country is in better shape than a few months ago but there are still reports of equipment shortages Some frontline health care workers are   their personal protective gear  CNN   the Trump administration has not fully utilized the Defense Production Act to spur manufacturing of critical supplies like masks gowns and gloves Some efforts are underway but experts say its not enough and that the law was invoked far too late Because of that smaller physicians offices and assistedliving facilities are currently facing shortages  Regarding the governors Trump is exaggerating  CNN reached out to governors offices across the country earlier this month after Trump   about governors having everything they needed Democratic governors from Washington state Colorado Michigan and Illinois said they needed more supplies from the federal government One Republican governor told CNN that Trumps comment was accurate  Trump is a   on this front He also said in April that governors were satisfied with the supplies they received even as governors from both parties said they faced shortages of medical equipment  The President has     that the US has the lowest coronavirus mortality rate worldwide During Tuesdays press conference he was less definitive  Our case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European Union and almost everywhere else in the world Trump said  He later added We have done much better than most and with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most   While the observed casefatality ratio has decreased since   as of Tuesday morning the US fatality rate of 37 was lower than only nine of the 20 countries most affected by covid19 according to   from Johns Hopkins In terms of coronavirus deaths per capita the US ranked   When Trump claimed the US case fatality rate was lower than the European Union and almost everywhere else in the world two monitors behind him displayed charts to that effect    The regional graph is more accurate than the countrybased one but still omits relevant context According to the ECDC data the total coronavirus deaths for countries in the European Union divided by those countries cumulative coronavirus cases is in fact higher than that of the United States However the case fatality rates for all African and Asian countries as defined by the European CDC are both lower than the United States  Another factor to consider when comparing coronavirus deaths across countries is the timeline Initially deaths spiked as countries struggled to respond to the virus and adequately protect the elderly and others at high risk As a result a country that was hit hard but contained the virus relatively quickly might have a higher case fatality rate than a country where cases are still increasing  In the latter situation such as the US the fatality rate is likely to decline if the number of cases are increasing but the number of deaths is not increasing at the same rate Thats potentially the case in the US as the New York Times   that deaths are not spiking along with the recent coronavirus surges across the southern United States possibly due to fewer infections in nursing homes which account for more than 40 of all coronavirus deaths in the US "},

tried to thwart the investigation into his involvement in the Watergate break in But Trumps attempt to systematically dismantle the checks and balances that are the bedrock of Americas democracy has arguably taken a far heavier toll  He is showing that he can bend the levers of government to suit his whims by simply disposing of respected career government employees whom he perceives as having criticized him crossed him or refused to carry out his bidding With   he is demolishing the ideal that inspectors general can operate independently without fear of retribution as they attempt to

source told CNN Saturday that there is an investigation into the alleged improper use by Pompeo of a political appointee Linicks dismissal follows the same pattern of Trumps Friday night firing in April of   the inspector general for the intelligence community who sent the anonymous Ukraine whistleblower complaint to Congress  As with Atkinson Trump told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a letter Friday night that he needed to have the fullest confidence in appointees serving as inspectors general and said that was no longer the case with Linick When Trump used that same phrase in Atkinsons firing on April 3   it was hard not to think that the Presidents loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General Trump defended his decision by claiming that Atkinson took a fake report and gave it to Congress Amid outcry from Democratic lawmakers over Linicks firing Republican Sen Chuck Grassley noted in a Saturday statement that the President must provide Congress with written justification for removing inspectors general and said a general lack of confidence simply is not sufficient detail to satisfy Congress The Iowa Republican added that inspectors general are crucial in correcting government failures and promoting the accountability that the American people deserve Later on Saturday Sen

retaliation shows no signs of abating He has long demonstrated his contempt for officials who serve in the investigative oversight roles in government and though the jobs are nonpartisan he is particularly distrustful of inspectors general who served under the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama His anger over the Russia probe led to the firings of FBI Director James Comey and Comeys deputy   At a time when one would expect the President to be more concerned with consequential matters like the more than 88000 coronavirus deaths and record unemployment Trump is still seething over his treatment during the impeachment inquiry On Saturday he dredged up unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about the impeachment probe and fired off a tweet urging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham to investigate what a conservative writer called the Russian collusion hoax Get tough and move quickly or it will be too late Trump tweeted quoting a tweet from Sean Davis the cofounder of The Federalist who argued McConnell would not be able to maintain the Senate majority without addressing the hoax and holding the hoaxers accountable They MUST pay a big price for what they have done to our Country Dont let them get away with this Trump tweeted tagging Graham Trump has shown the same troubling intolerance for oversight

{"3912": "The arrival of the items is part of the Trump administrations effort to expedite the shipment of supplies overseas as the nation wrestles with a dire shortage of equipment in the face of a growing number of coronavirus cases and deaths  The Federal Emergency Management Agency launched the endeavor dubbed Project Airbridge in late March with six US distributors including the company Medline So far millions of supplies including gloves surgical masks surgical gowns and face masks have arrived in the US on more than 70 flights  earning praise from   whos called it an amazing success and at times criticism from governors who say the supplies should go directly to the states While the supplies are flown in by FEMA the allocation of supplies is split between the administrations designated hotspots and the distributors customers some of whom might also be in those critical areas  Medline provided CNN access to one of its thirdparty warehouses where cargo flown in on an Airbridge flight is broken down before being sent to a company distribution center On April 16 one of those shipments arrived at Chicago OHare International Airport on a FEMAchartered flight which average between 750000 to 800000 a flight Within a 48hour window the products were cleared by customs unloaded from the aircraft and arranged to send to a local warehouse to be organized At the warehouse a team of around 50 people moved quickly to remove tarps take the individual boxes of items out of the larger packaging combine the boxes and move them to a trucking dock to ship them off to their next destination  From wheels down to delivery to a hospital the process can take around three to seven days  One of the great benefits of Project Airbridge I think is that were trying to leverage what the private sector does best and what the federal government can step in and do very well in a short time fashion said Jesse Greenberg public affairs director at Medline Even with the initiative in place governors nationwide continue jockeying for critically needed equipment  at times blasting the administration for not handing the supplies directly over to the states instead of to customers within the state  What they are taking credit for the White House is that the distributors have customers in Illinois that they are sending goods to because those customers ordered those items of PPE so thats a far cry from delivering to the states so that we can distribute said Illinois Gov JB Pritzker a Democrat Trump said Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence is providing governors with a county breakdown of whats been received  This way the governor should know exactly what is being delivered through a private sector supply chain within their states as well as through the Project Airbridge he told reporters at a White House briefing  The coalition of companies helping with the administrations socalled Airbridge effort cover more than 9095 of the health systems in the US according to a source familiar with the initiative  Late last month Medlines CEO Charlie Mills along with senior executives of several other supply chain distributors met with Trump and Pence to discuss the response to coronavirus  At the time the companies explained how they were getting supplies to the US We explained that one thing we dont own and operate is a fleet of cargo planes and so what we suggested was that on top of the cargo flights that we have arranged  and that we continue to arrange and bring in on a weekly basis  if the federal government wanted to arrange for cargo flight we could bring additional PPE and other medical devices on top of what were already bringing in Greenberg said  Thats what Project Airbridge is now FEMA covers the cost to fly supplies into the US thereby expediting the shipment of supplies from major distributors Critics say companies are profiting off the arrangement Greenberg pushed back I think one of the misconceptions out there is that a company like ours is somehow going gangbusters at the expense of this virus and that couldnt be farther than the truth he said Prices have gone up Were not passing any of those costs on to our customers In fact many of the items we handle were selling at a loss The companies involved in Project Airbridge dont have a contract with FEMA The partnership according to a source familiar with Project Airbridge is based on a memorandum of understanding between the private companies and the federal government  Greenberg said Medline is in frequent communication with the government about supplies Were sharing information about where our supplies are going Theyre getting information of course from the field about where the supplies are where shortages may be certainly whatever areas the virus is most impacting he said  The number of locations is frequently evolving Greenberg added Its a dynamic list its growing its changing That list is updated every day or every couple of days The company reports back to FEMA when a delivery is made  Despite repeated requests for specifics on where overseas supplies are delivered FEMA has not provided details on allocation or prioritized hotspots  Medlines shipment earlier this month was one of many Among the states receiving supplies from that shipment are New Jersey California Washington Illinois New York Michigan and Louisiana The governors of those states are among the many clamoring for the administration to do more to ensure healthcare workers have the equipment they need to treat patients  While Project Airbridge is not the only federal effort to shore up supplies  the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services are also assisting  the initiative is one of many tests of private and government partnership at a critical time  Were trying to do as much as humanly possible Greenberg said And when we have a partner willing to help bring additional product we can get to our customers and other health care facilities that are desperately in need"},
{"6885": "In a memo to the Bureau of Prisons Barr said that officials should prioritize the use of statutory authorities to release eligible prisoners early to home confinement while acknowledging that some vulnerable inmates may be more protected from the deadly virus outside of the tight prison quarters  The directive came as the Bureau of Prisons reported that 10 inmates and eight Bureau of Prisons employees have tested positive for the coronavirus as of Thursday even as prison officials have continued to implement strict measures to stave off the spread of the virus including a ban on most visitors and a twoweek quarantine for all new inmates entering a facility Advocates and prison officials have warned that the close confines of a correctional facility could quickly become a hotbed for the deadly illness We have some of the bestrun prisons in the world and I am confident in our ability to keep inmates in our prisons as safe as possible from the pandemic currently sweeping across the globe Barr wrote in the memo  At the same time there are some atrisk inmates who are nonviolent and pose a minimal likelihood of recidivism and who might be safer serving their sentences in home confinement rather than in BOP facilities Barr wrote   According to the memo prison officials should first consider factors like the age and vulnerability of the inmate to coronavirus the inmates conduct in prison the inmates crime of conviction and the potential danger posed to the public and whether the inmate has a plan in place to reenter society and avoid recidivism before granting them early release  Inmates who are approved for the home confinement must also first be quarantined in prison for 14 days before being discharged to avoid spreading an undetected case of the virus Barr said  Nearly 5000 inmates in federal custody are over the age of 65 according to the Bureau of Prisons putting them in an age bracket that is at higher risk for severe illness after contracting the virus the CDC says  Since the virus began spreading the Bureau of Prisons has shifted to a moderated lockdown posture temporarily blocking social visitors as well as lawyers in most circumstances from visiting inmates and restricting inmate movements The Trump administration had weighed a variety of plans for an early release amid an intense lobbying campaign by lawmakers and activists that highlighted concerns about an unprepared prison system  In recent days a bipartisan group of lawmakers as well as advocacy groups tapped into Justice Department and White House channels that were active in past criminal justice reform fights including the office of senior adviser Jared Kushner according to advocates and officials involved in the process Activists including Revs Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton said last week that they had spoken with President Donald Trump about the issue Kim Kardashian who has used her celebrity to successfully lobby the White House on criminal justice

Sen Dick Durbin the Senate Democratic whip urged the Justice Department and Bureau of Prisons to consider releasing vulnerable inmates under provisions of the First Step Act in a letter  Trump on Sunday told reporters that he thought the dangers for vulnerable prisoners were a bit of a problem and said that his administration was looking into different ways to release inmates early including through executive order The White House legislative affairs team has been conducting outreach to congressional offices in recent days pushing for a bill that would allow for certain elderly nonviolent prisoners to leave facilities amid the outbreak according to a senior White House official  But by Monday Trump had retweeted a conservative commentator who scoffed at the idea dashing the hopes of some advocates  After Barr announced the memo and new policy at a news conference Thursday activists involved in the effort applauded I think this could have a huge impact on both the prison system as a whole but also really on the people who are working there too said Jessica Jackson a cofounder and senior counsel at cut50 a criminal justice reform group that had pushed for the expansion of the early release program with administration officials in recent weeks  Inside the prisons this would not only allow them to start engaging in better social distancing practices because theyll be a little less crowded but it will also take a lot of pressure off the prison hospitals and the prison medical workers who are otherwise going to be scrambling to care for this population if the

most powerful nation lacks a coherent national strategy to meet another cresting viral crisis the capacity or even the willingness to take steps that might stop it It is also led by a man who is suggesting by his actions and attitudes that he doesnt care that much about the unfolding tragedy Trump who has previously predicted a miracle would occur or the virus would just disappear in the warmer weather again declared falsely Wednesday that the danger had passed  even with the nation racing towards another deadly summit of infection In his latest misleading effort to create a picture

Blumenthal president of The Commonwealth Fund in an Alliance for Health Policy and Commonwealth Fund webinar on Wednesday It can be frustrating and perplexing he added But now is the time to stop dwelling on the past and to start looking forward and to ask ourselves how we can seize the moment learn from experience and make things better Instead the Presidents attitude appears to have crossed into callous indifference Trump has long denied the worsening situation over his failed gamble of pushing for aggressive state openings to revive the economy on which his reelection hopes may depend He has constantly flouted guidance on mask wearing and social distancing insisted on being pretty much the only entity in the Western world holding indoor events that   and has failed to hardly ever mention the victims of the pandemic His behavior has brought about the extraordinary spectacle of a President running for a second term ignoring a massive national crisis that has killed tens of thousands of Americans and has no end in sight  Trump reached for his familiar tactics of distraction on Wednesday all but accusing Democrats of supporting unidentified demonstrators who he said want to haul down statues of Jesus Christ as he stepped up the culture war tactics he adopted during the nations national reckoning on race In a Wednesday news conference Trump largely ignored the huge and worsening national crisis But he delivered his latest evidencefree prediction of stunning medical advances on vaccines and therapeutics not yet supported by any evidence I think youre going to have a big surprise a beautiful surprise sooner than anybody would think Vice President Mike Pence the head of the White House coronavirus task force who hasnt held a public briefing with top health officials in weeks apparently sought to spin the situation when he traveled up to Capitol Hill for lunch with Republican senators South Carolina Republican Sen Lindsey Graham said Pence mentioned lowered mortality rates from the virus and said that the provision of emergency protective equipment in hospitals was in good shape   Given the terrible economic consequences of lockdowns imposed to bend the curve of infections several months ago there was always going to be a limited tolerance for longterm shutdowns But the White House has long since given up offering Americans advice on how to prepare themselves for venturing out into the world  Indeed Trump gladly ignored his own governments advice on when it was safe for states to reopen  The facts of the pandemic now clearly show that northeastern states that imposed painful restrictions on their people for longest  such as New York and New Jersey  have been most successful in reducing infections Those that most enthusiastically accepted Trumps urging to open  such as Texas Florida and Arizona  are now racing towards their own crisis points  One exception is California which despite months of draconian public health measures is still in the middle of its battle The rising infections in opening states also raise the grim possibility that even those who have carefully begun to get back to business in the northeast and the Midwest will see infections soon tick up again A new battery of infection figures and academic projections on Wednesday reflected how the United States is heading into an intensifying duel with the virus even as its economic competitors like the European Union  now mulling a ban on American visitors and which has a higher population than the US  begin to contemplate life after successfully suppressing the pandemic at least for now Arizona is currently seeing the highest number of new coronavirus cases per capita of any state in the country and more than any other state besides New York or New Jersey has experienced  which puts the rate at about 38 new cases per 100000 people per day  Texas Republican Gov Greg Abbott warned in an interview with KFDATV on Wednesday that his state was facing a massive outbreak of the virus Florida piled up another daily record of 5500 new cases of Covid19   also finds that 26 states now have rising infection rates including 10 where cases are going up by 50 or more each day Another 10 states are steady and 14 states are seeing falling new infections   There is little direction coming from political leaders including those in worst affected states who are loath to shut down economies again and on a national level inside and outside the White House Still if hospitalizations and death rates begin to rise as experts predict they will as people being infected now get more sick in the weeks ahead there could be agonizing and politically dicey decisions for state governors about restoring some kind of restrictions on their citizens Florida Republican Gov Ron DeSantis a Trump ally who is refusing to make mask wearing mandatory statewide said Tuesday Ultimately weve got to trust people to make good decisions His fellow Sunshine

emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington Universitys Milken School of Public Health warned that the sacrifices made by millions of Americans who lost jobs in lockdowns designed

a mask in private he has not used his powerful social media platforms to encourage his supporters to do the same And in meetings with advisers Trump has stated that more strenuous calls to wear masks might send the wrong message as he attempts to move on from the virus The debate over masks has come to encapsulate a federal effort marked by repeated reversals conflicting recommendations low

prevent a run on equipment that was in short supply I dont regret that Dr Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said during congressional testimony last week At that time there was a paucity of equipment that our health care providers needed  who put themselves daily in harms way of taking care of people who are ill We did not want to divert masks and PPE away from them to be used by the people Yet it is only now months into a crisis that shows no signs of waning that top White House officials and allies of the President have begun to recognize if more Americans begin wearing masks the outbreak could be slowed  White House officials say their messaging this week will shift to convincing Americans the virus will not abate any time soon  but that steps such as wearing masks can help contain it as the country learns to live alongside it While there are outbreaks and were tending to the needs of those outbreaks we have the infrastructure in place to deal with them one official said in previewing the new messaging push Still after refusing for months to wear one himself denigrating his election rival for appearing masked in public and stoking a cultural backlash against their use its not clear whether any attempt by the President to convince people to cover their faces will prove effective Emerging on April 3 a Friday afternoon Trump announced the US Centers for Disease Control was urging Americans to wear a mask when they leave their home But he immediately declared he wouldnt be wearing one himself Instead of encouraging Americans to heed the recommendation he suggested instead they do what they want With the masks it is going to be really a voluntary thing the President said You can do it You dont have to do it I am choosing not to do it  His announcement came after days of heated task force meetings where officials argued in the Situation Room over whether to reverse course and tell Americans to cover up In the Oval Office Trump had expressed deep skepticism that any American would wear a mask  and worried that advising them to would cause panic In the earliest days of the pandemic recommending masks to the general public was barely a topic of conversation among White House officials An exception was Matt Pottinger the deputy national security adviser who has orchestrated the Presidents Asia policy A onetime Wall Street Journal reporter based in China where he covered the SARS outbreak Pottinger had lived in a country where mask wearing has long been routine and where as the coronavirus began spreading it became ubiquitous According to current and former senior administration officials Pottinger and some members of the National Security Council recommended to other members of the task force in February that mask wearing be among the recommendations to Americans as the virus began spreading in the United States Presenting data from South Korea and Japan that suggested widespread mask usage could help slow the spread of illness Pottinger and members of the NSCs weapons of mass destruction team argued similar advice should be offered to Americans Underpinning the internal backandforth was the persistent shortage of medical grade masks for frontline hospital workers which states and the federal government scrambled to resolve through patchwork shipments and appeals to the private sector Some White House officials feared a blanket recommendation for Americans to use face coverings might cause a rush on the badly needed medical masks aggravating the already grave situation for hospital workers and first responders The administration wanted masks to go to health professionals and didnt want to cause panic and have people buy up masks that were needed for frontlines one former administration official who was present for the discussions said That was part of the justification Still that did not prevent Pottinger from wearing a mask himself at the White House and encouraging others on the NSC to do the same At one point in March  while the administration was still recommending against maskwearing  members of the council received a shipment of blue surgical masks from Taiwan for use at the White House At the time the CDC said on its website that it does not recommend that people who are well wear a face mask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases including Covid19 Administration officials were vocal that Americans not go out to purchase masks It is not necessary for Americans to go out and buy masks Pence said during an appearance on CNN on March 1 In late February Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted Seriously people  STOP BUYING MASKS They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching Coronavirus In other instances some administration officials went as far as suggesting wearing a mask could increase the risk of infection for the wearer You can increase your risk of getting it coronavirus by wearing a mask if you are not a health care provider Adams said during an interview on Fox  Friends on March 2 Folks who dont know how to wear them properly tend to touch their faces a lot and actually can increase the spread of coronavirus By the end of March an increasing body of evidence began to emerge showing asymptomatic spread of the virus was causing cases to surge around the country Senior officials at the CDC told the White House that stronger guidelines  including a new recommendation on masks  were necessary to prevent the virus from spreading between asymptomatic people according to people familiar with the internal discussions The agency sent memos to the White House outlining their recommended guidance in the final week of March people familiar with the documents said They made clear that cloth face coverings  not medicalgrade masks  were being recommended But after receiving them some of Trumps advisers cautioned a nationwide recommendation might have negative side effects and advocated something more limited in scope potentially only in areas that are hardest hit Opinion among officials was divided Some wondered whether people in the United States  unlike citizens of Asian countries where mask wearing was already common  would ever submit to covering their faces deeming it a cultural hurdle One group raised the notion of rebranding them courtesy masks to appeal to Americans altruism Health experts including Dr Deborah Birx feared masks could lull people into abandoning other preventative measures like socially distancing And some of Trumps political advisers raised a different concern Would telling Americans to wear masks convey weakness at a moment the President was adopting a wartime mien The debate played out in meetings of the coronavirus task force in the White House Situation Room but also in the Oval Office where Trump appeared unenthusiastic about telling Americans to cover their faces and informed advisers he would not be seen wearing one in public  That is being discussed really very actively We were discussing it actively today in the task force and I can assure you its going to be on the agenda tomorrow Fauci the nations top infectious disease expert told CNN at the start of April Given the fact that we know that asymptomatic people are clearly transmitting infection it just makes commonsense that its not a bad idea to do that At one point the debate spilled into public view during a public task force briefing when Birx who had argued against a mask recommendation in private warned of getting a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected  A day later Trump emerged  begrudgingly according to people familiar with the matter  to announce the new CDC recommendations on masks But it was clear from the moment he said he wouldnt be adopting in the guidance himself that the debate over masks was far from ever Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents prime ministers dictators kings queens  I dont know Trump said Somehow I dont see it for myself Neither apparently did many of Trumps supporters who took the Presidents refusal to wear a mask himself as a sign that appearing in public with a covered face was a sign of weakness Over the course of April May and June Trump did little to combat that impression and instead seized on a new culture war mocking his rival Joe Biden for wearing a face mask when he emerged on Memorial Day to lay a wreath Its like his whole face is covered Its like he put a knapsack over his face   In private Trump told aides that wearing a mask would send a terrible message as he sought to project momentum in combating the virus and reopening the economy He also fretted that pictures of him in a mask would be repurposed by political rivals to accuse him of cowering from the scourge While his campaign produced masks bearing the slogan Keep America Great aides were never sure Trump would sign off on selling them to the public and they didnt appear on the campaigns online store When Trump emerged from the White House for the first time for a visit to a Honeywell factory in Arizona that was producing respirators he briefly put on a mask backstage but appeared uncomfortable and was told by an executive that he did not need to wear one Later when he visited a Ford plant in Michigan where mask wearing was required he was encouraged to wear a mask by the automakers president and wore one briefly with the presidential seal But later he removed it telling reporters he didnt want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it The White House insisted that because Trump was tested regularly  as was everyone who came into his proximity  he didnt need to wear a mask though the Abbott testing produced used by the White House has shown high rates of false negatives His public reluctance on the issue also appeared to cause confusion among his supporters over whether wearing a mask was really necessary   in midMay found only 40 of Republicans said everyone should be required to wear face masks in public compared to 64 overall Those numbers have improved over time but more recent surveys continue to show a partisan divide on the wisdom of mask wearing  from the middle of June showed 52 of Republicans said masks should be worn all or most of the time compared to 86 of Democrats As a new surge in cases has swept the country however it has grown increasingly clear that many Republicans have decided that a fuller embrace of mask wearing is necessary Over the past week top Republican officials and members of the conservative media  including those watched closely by the President  have turned abruptly toward recommending masks and in some cases requiring it Texas Gov Greg Abbott issued a statewide mandatory order on Thursday requiring Texans to wear masks in public Vice President Mike Pence whose maskfree visit to the Mayo Clinic in May turned into a symbol of the White Houses relaxed attitude has started regularly wearing a navy blue number with the presidential seal The sudden embrace of masks even by those politicians who once framed the issue as one of personal choice has added to the pressure on Trump to endorse maskwearing more forcefully according to several sources with knowledge of the discussions  Theres more talk of using masks as a frontline defense one person involved in the discussions said adding there are a variety of views being shared and that the White House hasnt landed on an approach yet  Top congressional Republicans meanwhile have pushed masks far more aggressively than Trump in recent days   the No 3 House Republican posted a photo of her father former Vice President Dick Cheney wearing a blue surgical mask underneath a cowboy hat realmenwearmasks she wrote  A top GOP aide said they view masks as key to preventing states from closing down again Medical experts and task force members have been stressing the importance of masks to White House officials recently hoping theyll agree to amplify the message people familiar with the conversations said While Trump continues to refuse to wear a mask in public he has shifted his tone somewhat appearing more favorable of masks during a recent FOX Business Network interview and acknowledging that hes worn one on occasion where social distancing is impossible  Im all for masks Trump said I think masks are good Still a complete embrace of maskwearing could prove politically tricky for Trump People familiar with White House thinking say Trumps aides are hoping to move past the political aspect of mask wearing and reframe it as a real concern for public health and safety a tall order for a President who appeared to stoke the political and cultural divisions of mask wearing for months How much the President will take a leadership role in encouraging maskwearing remains unclear In an appearance Thursday to tout positive jobs numbers he only briefly mentioned face coverings in a list of best practices for stopping the spread of Covid But some of Trumps top aides have begun to reframe the matter as one of personal responsibility hoping to place the onus on individuals to contain the virus  and by extension speed reopenings In public appearances officials have argued recent spikes in cases are due to the failure of people to adhere to social distancing guidelines or mask recommendations  and not the premature lifting of stayathome orders that Trump loudly encouraged  It is really not about reopening Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Sunday on CNNs State of the Union defending the White Houses encouragement of lifting restrictions in states where infection rates have climbed Azar claimed the culprit is instead what our behaviors are within that  If we act irresponsibly dont socially distance dont use face coverings in settings where we cant socially distance if we dont practice appropriate personal hygiene were going to see spread of disease he said Pence on Sunday also sought to put the focus on Americans responsibility to wear masks  not on the reopenings the White House wanted  Younger Americans have been congregating in ways that may have disregarded the guidance that we gave at the federal level for all the phases of reopening he said on CBS  But aides push for individual responsibility seems complicated by Trumps own behavior as the pandemic continues to rage After convening political events in Oklahoma and Arizona  where social distancing was actively discouraged maskwearing was absent and people later became sick  Trump headlined an event at Mount Rushmore on Friday that brought 7500 people into a stadium where distancing proved impossible and not everyone covered their face Even even as Trump has finally started to encourage people to wear masks though not wearing one himself his son Donald Trump Jr is actively spreading doubt about the effectiveness of masks against the coronavirus On Facebook Trump Jr posted an image of a lab where scientists were working in certain hazmat suits known as positive pressure suits Text on the image says This is what virologist wear to protect themselves from a virus Dont worry though Your bandana probably works too"},
