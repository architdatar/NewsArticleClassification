tech may be facing the loss or at least the modification of its legal liability protections Because they claim they dont curate their comments  TURNER Google insists they follow the same rules of the road they set for everyone else and that those rules are crystal clear We do have strict publisher policies that govern the content ads can run on which includes comments on the site This is a longstanding policy This feud comes fresh on the heels of Twitters clash with President Trump over its decision to slap warning labels on his feed for inciting violence  Republican lawmakers say big

New Path Forward in the PostCold War World Mr Secretary thanks for joining us  ROBERT GATES FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY Thanks Bret  BAIER Congrats on the book and I want to talk to you about it specifically in just a minute But I want to just ask you since youve served for eight different presidents youve been CIA director youve been defense secretary Have you ever seen a time like were in now  GATES No I cant say I have I mean I lived  I was on the NSC staff during the last days of the Nixon administration and during the whole Watergate affair I was in the White House on loan from CIA at the end of the Carter administration when we were in trouble in a lot of different ways But no I dont think Ive ever seen anything quite like this  BAIER Yes two crises in a row obviously the pandemic and the situation were facing across the country in the wake of the George Floyd killing You have said that you are actually for some changes including name changes for some military bases Cite in the New York Times that you called to replace those names and the quote they said is as a longtime Soviet scholar you added Im very sensitive to the notion of rewriting history But yes you think those names should be changed  GATES I think that  I think the name should be changed I think its a question of placement and time and we dont want to be in a position of celebrating people who were in fact traitors to the United States And when it comes to statuary and so on that that kind of thing I think belongs in museums rather than in places where it appears that were celebrating them  I  you know Ive said I dont know why we dont have a fort Ulysses S Grant or a Fort George Patton or a major facility named for a Medal of Honor recipient So I think this is an opportunity to make some changes that frankly bring us into the 21st century  BAIER Part of your book is about the exercise of power when to use the military perhaps when not to Your reflections after what we saw from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Milley  General Milley coming out apologizing for being that event at Lafayette Park and the whole back and forth about the use of the military during this time  GATES Well I agreed with some other retired senior officers former chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Mullen and General Dempsey against the use of the Insurrection Act you know the  I think its important to understand the difference between the regular army which is fundamentally trained to kill people and the National Guard which is trained in a lot of things Youre likely to see them handing out food at a food bank or sandbagging a flooding river as you are anything else  They can fight as we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan but they also are trained in crowd control They have good relations with local law enforcement because theyre from the community And that if the local police cant handle a problem the National Guard is the  is the right  is the right way to turn  When the Insurrection Act has been used the last time it was used it was used the time of Rodney King riot  the riots after Rodney King was killed and the governor of California felt the situation couldnt be managed by the National Guard and first President Bush did call it in But it looked to me at least from the outside that the National Guard and the other elements of law enforcement that were present were able to handle the problem  BAIER You know youre talking about your book Theres another book thats raising a lot of eyebrows and obviously the White House is pushing back on it already I assume you havent read John Boltons book but the former National Security Adviser is facing lawsuits from the DOJ Heres what the President said about this book coming out Take a listen  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP When you do classify that to me is a very strong criminal problem And he knows hes got classified information any conversation with me is classified Then it becomes even worse of he lies about the conversation which I understand he might have in some cases  END VIDEO CLIP  BAIER Just want to get your reaction about the process You obviously had to go through the process with your first memoir duty And whats your reaction to all of this and what the President said  GATES Bret I would tell you Ive been through the process four times including the book that is just out In all cases Ive had to have it reviewed both by the CIA and by the Defense Department I found that the changes that they requested were minimal and they moved expeditiously and I really didnt have a problem with the process So I have  I have the e mails demonstrating that the drafts have been accepted And it seems to me to be a legitimate process to go through  Just based on the newspapers it looks to me like John Bolton has cooperated in that process for several months whether it was actually completed or not I just  Im in no position to know  BAIER One thing in your last book that you wrote about and it factors into the current situation politically is about Joe Biden You called him a man of integrity But you said I think hes been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades  As you look at the situation right now do you know who youre supporting or your thoughts about Joe Biden and his ability to be commander in chief  GATES Well I think the stay  I stand by the statement that I wrote in the book that I obviously have very significant policy differences with Joe Biden But I do think that hes a person of integrity and a decent person And I think Ill just leave it at that  BAIER And last thing Mr Secretary a lot of focus on China in the news Youve  over many years dealt with different regimes in China Your thoughts on China and what its up to now in the big picture  GATES Well Bret I think we made  I think we made two big mistakes  strategic mistakes when it comes to China Our policy toward China for the last 40 years has been underpinned by the assumption that a richer China would become a freer China And it has become crystal clear especially under President Xi that that assumption was wrong  The second was the failure to understand that a richer China would become a more assertive China And so I think its only been in the last three or four years that people have begun to realize that this is a regime that we are going to be in a contest with for as far into the future as we can see a rivalry  BAIER Mr Secretary we appreciate your time Good luck on the book  GATES Thanks a lot Bret Appreciate it  BAIER Up next Joe Biden makes

from coming out even though its on the way out and in fact a lot of people have it One excerpt about China Bolton writes about the G20 summit with President Xi of China He Trump then stunningly turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election alluding to Chinas economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns pleading with Xi to ensure hed win He stressed the importance of farmers increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat and the elector outcome  A lot of different quotes coming out this evening Well start there with our panel Susan Ferrechio Chief Congressional Correspondent for the Washington Examiner Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press and Matthew Continetti founding editor of the Washington Free Beacon Julie there at the White House it seems like there is still this push to try to prevent this book from seeing the light of day  JULIE PACE WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF ASSOCIATED PRESS Yes there definitely is though I think that is becoming less relevant at this point The book is out We have obtained it Other news organizations have obtained it And most of the most I think attentiongrabbing details are really already out there for the world to see So yes I think this legal fight will continue on a matter of principle for the White House but I think the damage is done terms of the information that Bolton wanted to get out there being there for the public to consume  BAIER Susan weve seen other administration officials write memoirs referencing a president who is still in office One of them was on our show tonight former defense secretary Robert Gates who wrote a memoir referencing some negative things about President Obama and Joe Biden But this account by all accounts and I havent read it all yet seems pretty scathing of a chaos behind the scenes at the White House  SUSAN FERRECHIO WASHINGTON EXAMINER Right And some of the things that Bolton accuses Trump of doing are really indefensible if they are true But even Bolton has run into credibility issues with his own claims I think he was on board with the weapons of mass destruction argument and even I think former President Bush called his credibility into question He left on pretty bad terms when the president fired him and then announced it on Twitter And already some of his book has been refuted William Barr the attorney general denied parts of the book they came out back in January  So if this is all going to  as Julie said a lot of this is already out now so trying to block the book isnt going to do the president any good Its really going to be about how he responds to this Does he do the classic Trump denial its all fake news And if he does do that which I fully expected to do will the public believe it Because there have been many former administration officials come out and make pretty damning claims against the president And we are getting closer and closer to the election So these things are going to cause increasing damage as we approach the November election So at this point the president I think really needs to get out there and respond to the claims that Bolton is making  BAIER Matthew the political impact on something like this on somebody like President Trump  MATTHEW CONTINETTI EDITOR IN CHIEF WASHINGTON FREE BEACON Its hard to say Ambassador Bolton now joins President Trumps former secretary of state former secretary of defense former chief of staff whos also the former secretary of Homeland Security and Jeff Sessions the former AG who had a critical tweet thread in recent weeks all of whom criticizing the presidents management style  The funny thing Bret though is that when you read the Trump in the Bolton excerpt hes not much different than the Trump in public International if you recall he called on China in public to investigate Hunter Biden when the Ukraine scandal broke So for that reason Im not sure that the Bolton narrative will change many minds especially since you have one group the Trump supporters saying that Bolton is a traitor and the other group the Democrats who we heard in the opening clip saying well now you tell us Youre no good to us now So I think that leaves Bolton in a position where hell just have a bestseller  BAIER Exactly Here is Kellyanne Conway about this book Take a listen  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  KELLYANNE CONWAY COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP Two words  national security Its pretty unusual to have a memoir like this while the people youre talking about are still in office and are still  your colleagues are still working in the administration The name of the book is The Room Where It Happened So Ambassador Bolton himself makes clear that he was in the Oval Office he was in the situation room he had a lot of access to the president and foreign leaders And so for me its not about quote protecting the president Its really about protecting the nation  END VIDEO CLIP  BAIER Julie it is interesting to see the pushback by the White House the embrace by the left even though they are upset that Bolton didnt testify during the impeachment hearings  PACE I think both sides can actually agree on one thing with John Bolton and thats that they all think hes out to sell books right now that thats his main focus here The White House gets themselves a little bit tripped up on the argument that theyre making here about trying to block the book where they say the book shouldnt go forward because it didnt go through the proper classification process There is classified information that is still in there acknowledging that though you are also acknowledging that some of that is true that the information did happen in real classified settings So I think they do get a little bit of a mixed message off of that  From the Democratic standpoint it will be interesting to watch how they both try to push forward some of the accounts in the book while also trying to discredit Bolton for not having come forward to testify  BAIER Well well have a complete rundown as we get the book and go through it as well Panel thank you Stand by  Next up big tech what Republicans are doing to push back That after the break  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  SEN JOSH HAWLEY RMO Just look at what Google tried to do just yesterday where they tried to deplatform a conservative news site The Federalist They tried to deny The Federalist access to Googles web platform their ad platform which would have essentially shut them down This is the kind of thing that big tech is doing all the time Twitter commenting on labeling the tweets of the president of the United States it just gets worse and worse  Its becoming more and more insidious the way that these platforms use their power and thats why its important to have legislation that will give folks their day in court  END VIDEO CLIP  BAIER That was Senator Josh Hawley in two different places but it was the same senator talking about a fight with big tech and what is going to come next This is getting a lot of attention not only about censorship but about efforts to demonetize Google has put out a statement saying that To be clear The Federalist is not currently demonetized We do have strict publisher policies that govern the content ads can run on which includes comments on the site This is a longstanding policy  Bottom line its not happening on that site as of yet but there are real concerns here Susan on Capitol Hill Were back with the panel Capitol hill is focused on this both sides of the aisle Republicans are taking this and running with it right now  FERRECHIO Thats right You just saw Senator Tom Cotton today say that he was nearly removed from Twitter for going on the air and talking about supporting the use of the military on our streets to control the civil unrest  There are definitely feelings amongst conservatives on Capitol Hill that big tech is slanted against conservatives and they are treating conservatives unfairly As you mentioned the NBC collaboration with the Foreign Advocacy Group to try to deplatform The Federalist and Zero Hedge which I believed was deplatformed for its comments section when in fact Google does not have to worry about that same liability They enjoy that liability under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act And what the Josh Hawley bill does is it takes away immunity unless Google can prove its a neutral platform because they are supposed to be neutral in order to enjoy that liability protection So the Hawley bill would hold them accountable for that  And dont forget President Trump issued an executive order recently that interpreted that section 230 is not giving the big tech firms this liability protection So there are a lot of questions about this right now and clearly feeling amongst conservatives that something needs to change in the law to protect conservative thoughts and viewpoints on social media  BAIER I talked to Attorney General Barr about this Julie and clearly this is a big factor for them And politically how it works there probably is some upside going politically into this realm when youre talking about big tech privacy and censorship  PACE Yes absolutely I do think to Susans point I think among conservatives this has become a bit of a rallying cried certainly with the presidents own tweets but also just this broader idea that tech is biased here I do think that big tech finds themselves in a really tricky position On the one hand they are trying to be advocates for free speech They are trying to be open sort of open platforms for any type of discussion When you do that you do open up your platforms to a lot of discussions that a lot of Americans do find objectionable But when you cross over that line and start making decisions about what can be allowed and what cant be you run up against politics and a lot of real concerns here  BAIER Matthew last word  CONTINETTI One word Bret  2024 Thats what this is about  BAIER Thats what this is about Tom Cotton in particular  CONTINETTI And Josh Hawley I think were beginning to see one of the major issues of the 2024 Republican primary emerge  BAIER There you go I was asking for pithy but I didnt think I was going to get one word Panel thank you very much  LAUGHTER  BAIER Thats good stuff yes When we come back the brighter side of things some good news  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BAIER Breaking right now in Atlanta we have aerial photos of some fights breaking out near the site of that shooting Remember the white police officer former Atlanta police officer charged  a group of people and some

{"4019": "Fox News senior meteorologist   who recently   to   told the “ ” on Monday that she was taken off the list to testify at a hearing geared toward understanding why and how the pandemic took root in New York nursing homes She said she believes   or his administration were behind the decision  “I was supposed to be on the list” Dean said on Monday  “I actually filled out all the paperwork and sent the letter to all the lawmakers I believe July 28 a few days before the first hearing They told me they couldn’t get me on that day last Monday but that I would be on today I have several emails saying that that was happening”  She said she had correspondence with New York Assemblyman   and that he was the one who was emailing her “back and forth and was saying that he was talking to the chair Assembly Health Committee Chair Richard Gottfried and that the chair said absolutely she’ll get her day on August the 10 today”  “I was supposed to hear something over the weekend I never did and I was told that I was taken off the list” Dean said  Kilmeade then asked Dean “why” she was taken off the list  “I can only guess at this point” she responded “I think it went higher than the chair I think that it was Andrew Cuomo or his administration that decided that they didn’t want my voice to be heard and that’s really unfortunate”  In a statement sent to Fox News Rich Azzopardi senior advisor to Gov   said that the legislature is “a separate branch of government and they run their hearings how they see fit Fox News spoke with Byrne who provided some context as to what happened  Byrne confirmed that he was corresponding with Dean and told Fox News on Monday that Dean “has every right to be angry and upset”   When asked if he has any inclination as to what happened and why Dean was taken off the list Byrne said that the committee chairs control the agenda of their hearings Byrne told Fox News that in an email sent to him on Aug 2 “We were led to believe by the majority via email that she would be able to provide testimony” so he relayed that information to Dean  However Byrne said that on Friday he got an email from Gottfried where the Assembly Health Committee chair wrote “I have been told that ‘The Senate is not comfortable including her on the witness list so we will not be including her to testify’” Byrne a Republican said later on Friday he finally received the witness list but Dean was not on it Fox News reached out to Gottfried’s office for comment and was told Gottfried had no comment on the matter other than to recommend Fox News contact the Senate Majority for comment When Fox News asked the Senate Majority why they were “not comfortable” including Dean on the witness list Senate Majority Communications Director Mike Murphy said That assessment is not accurate In a statement sent to Fox News Murphy said “There are so many families that suffered because of this awful pandemic “We had so many brave families that wanted to share their heartbreaking stories including the ones that testified today and at last week’s hearing” he continued “As was made clear if you couldn’t testify in person we will accept all written testimony to be part of the written record” Byrne told Fox News “Every victim should have their story heard and it’s deeply troubling that she Dean wasn’t given the opportunity to provide testimony at today’s hearing He thanked Dean and said she has “been a notable outspoken voice and advocate for the thousands of families who have lost loved ones from this virus especially in adult care facilities and nursing facilities” Byrne added “My personal opinion is outside pressure likely from the governor’s administration after facing sharp criticism from the August 3 hearing did not want her Dean to testify”  Dean told Kilmeade she had planned to watch Monday’s hearing “but I have no desire to watch anymore because it just is another indication that they don’t want a real investigation This is a complete sham”  Last week speaking on  ” Dean said she is pushing for a “full” and “bipartisan”   during the coronavirus pandemic Dean made the demand the day after New York state lawmakers grilled the state’s top health official about the steep though ultimately unknown death toll at nursing homes in the state amid the pandemic Members of the Democraticled legislature have been holding hearings geared at understanding why and how the pandemic took root in   after the state Department of Health reported nearly   residents who had or likely had COVID19 died at nursing homes and assisted living facilities The state hasn’t disclosed how many nursing home residents died at hospitals or how many have been infected with COVID19 During last Monday’s hearing State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker defended the administration’s response and declined to provide key data points sought by Democrats and Republicans including a rough estimate of how many nursing home residents have died in hospitals because of the novel coronavirus Zucker cited worry that those numbers could include doublecounts of deaths “I will not provide information that I have not ensured is absolutely accurate” Zucker said “This is too big an issue and it’s too serious an issue” Dean told Fox News last week her husband’s father who was in a nursing home and rehabilitation center died the same day she and her husband found out he was sick She said that “we didn’t find out he had coronavirus until the death certificate” Dean went on to say that her husband’s mother “contracted coronavirus in her assisted living facility and was transported to the hospital and died in the hospital” Her motherinlaw died on April 14 about two weeks after her fatherinlaw passed away from the novel coronavirus Dean joins many New Yorkers whose loved ones have died at nursing homes amid the pandemic Last week they called for an independent investigation into whether nursing homes kept coronavirus patients separated had enough employees tracked workers who worked at multiple health care facilities and provided staffers with adequate protective gear The state’s health officials and attorney general are investigating whether nursing home operators are following federal and state directives including alerting families of COVID19 cases and deaths Cuomo has received   for his early order requiring that nursing homes accept COVID19 patients who had been released from hospitals effectively placing them in the same facilities housing the demographic most vulnerable to the virus Cuomo has   that New York’s original nursing home policy was in line with a March 13 directive from the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services CMS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC that went out to all states on how to control nursing homes New York among other states said at the time that nursing homes cannot refuse to take patients from hospitals solely because they have the coronavirus After mounting criticism that the policy put the most vulnerable people at risk and contributed to a high number of fatalities New York   on May 10 Now hospitals can only send patients who have tested negative for COVID19 to nursing homes Cuomo and his administration have been tightlipped about the extent of deaths and infections at the state’s more than 600 nursing homes since March and Cuomo declined to admit any missteps During a press conference Monday   he “wouldn’t do an investigation” into the nursing home deaths during the coronavirus pandemic in the state of New York"},
{"8565": "NEIL CAVUTO FOX NEWS ANCHOR All right so much on that Bill so much on the big powwow going on at the White House between Governor Andrew Cuomo and the president of the United States  On the right of your screen waiting for the Senate to take up that 484 billion stimulus or relief measure whatever you want to call it It looks like its going to have an easy time of it in the Senate In the House where they still want to add some things on we just dont know  Very good to have all of you with us on a very busy news day Im Neil Cavuto And this is YOUR WORLD  And yes energy prices are still declining and yes stocks were declining as a result but it wasnt as crazy or freaky as it got yesterday when we had negative prices for oil Today we came back a little bit  But for stocks the issue still seems to be that oil prices dropping cant be good for the economy going forward because it must be telegraphing problems  Now with the whole coronavirus thing its not a debate about how much its hurting the economy The only surprise is how much it is hurting the price of oil Were going to be getting to that in just a second  For the time being I want to just get a sense of whats happening at the White House and whether we will see the president and the governor together on tape and soon I dont know  John Roberts might  John  JOHN ROBERTS FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Neil it would take me a lot less time to tell you whats not going on at the White House as opposed to what is going on at the White House its so busy here these days  Governor Cuomo should be meeting with the president about now Governor Cuomo before leaving New York to come down here saying that testing was going to be a big part of the conversation Its been a big point of contention between the president and the governor the governor saying that the federal government has to step in President Trump saying hey its not the federal governments role to do testing  Things got quite heated between the two President Trump on Twitter telling Cuomo to stop talking and start doing his job Cuomo saying back to the president get up  get up off the couch stop watching me on television and go to work until the other day when Cuomo acknowledged that yes testing is the responsibility of the states and that the president is right when he says that  Yesterday the vice president Mike Pence was on the phone with the nations governors pointing out to them the excess capacity that the nation has for testing identifying all of the state labs that are certified to test for coronavirus  Today though Cuomo again saying that the presidents got a huge role to play in making sure that national suppliers are producing enough testing supplies and making sure that those supplies get out to the states  Listen to how he put it today  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GOV ANDREW CUOMO DNY So I get the instinct to distance yourself from it right But it is a situation where you need everybody to work together and you need to understand quickly whos in a better position to do what  From my point of view I think the federal government has to take that national manufacturer supply chain issue  END VIDEO CLIP  ROBERTS Now the White House has in the last 48 hours moved to some degree to do that  The president saying that he was going to invoke the Defense Production Act to produce those nasal swabs for coronavirus tests as well as making sure that there were enough specimen test tubes to go out to the states  The White House insisted there was currently enough testing capacity out there for all of the states if they chose to go to phase one of the reopening But the real question is Neil whats the demand for the supply Sort of whats the standard of testing Would you test only people who are very ill Is that what you have got capacity for  Would you test people who have got the sniffles Do you have the capacity for that Or do you have a much broader capacity to test almost anyone who comes in and says Im not feeling well That is still a question We dont exactly know what the testing capacity is vs the demand at this point  Neil  CAVUTO John Roberts at the White House thank you very very much  Now lets take a peek at oil today  It was still going down today but not as freaky today as it was yesterday We have two different contracts we want to show you here Remember these are traded in the futures markets So on the top of your screen there youre looking at how things fared on the incoming and outgoing contracts  That shows you that no matter how you slice it as they coalesced around 10 or 11 a barrel you can remember during the oil crises back some decades ago it was well over 100 a barrel  Now this had been in the 4050 range the breakeven point we were told 35 to 40 But no matter how far out you go on some of these contracts the betting seems to be that they see much lower oil prices because the world economy has essentially  has essentially stopped  And theres some concern at the White House that they want to do something for energy companies for the oil industry itself maybe buy a lot of that oil to shore up support Theres a lot of it slopping around out there They just dont know where to put it  Now Wyoming is one of the biggest states for oil in this country  That states governor joins me right now Mark Gordon the Wyoming governor with us  Governor always good to have you  The oil stuff on top of the coronavirus stuff was sort of like a double whammy for you guys to address But more on the oil front do you know what the president might be planning to do to support the industry Governor What have you heard  GOV MARK GORDON RWY No we have  Neil its great to be on  As you know we have got a delegation that is unified in trying to make sure that this nation is energyindependent that we have a strong oil sector  The conversations I have had with the president have all indicated his support of the industry As you have been alluding to obviously theres big challenges ahead  For a place like Wyoming we have a little bit of a differential to what you might see in Texas I used to work for Apache oil company and so Im very familiar with let the challenges are Cannot believe the collapse we have seen in the last four weeks  CAVUTO You know whats interesting Governor I do want to get into the coronavirus stuff with you so Im not being remiss here  But we have so much oil sloshing around the world they dont even know where to put it I dont know where the status is with our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve But I do know that a number of the options that oil firms and oil countries have out there they have all dried up or they have run out of space  You hear a lot of talk about this Vopak that has facilities around the world in Rotterdam all the way to Singapore where theres theres no room And Im just wondering if people did want to store it where are they going to store it Its tempting at these cheap prices but where do you put it  GORDON Well I think thats it  There just isnt any additional capacity And its wonderful that were talking about the Strategic Oil Reserve That would be  that would be a bit of a shot on the arm But I dont think its going to change  Its really been demand destruction that has been the big problem And I dont see  talking to our producers here both large and small were kind of anticipating a long haul on this  The price yesterday absolutely crazy Wyoming had seen negative prices a few weeks before that But these  these are definitely very challenging time  and problematic I think for the domestic industry  CAVUTO Yes No youre right about that  And to your point Governor now we were trading on negative price levels yesterday That outgoing May contract not to get too wonky about it traded out today positive at around the 10abarrel range  But having said that all of this really goes back to the coronavirus right and the freeze worldwide as a result And I know theres a rush to reopen the economy in waves in various ways your state other states but that until that happens until we see the economy getting a chance to percolate again oil prices could go still further south  Are you worried about that  GORDON Well I always worry about that  Yes I was talking to one of my former colleagues the other day and saying who would have ever thought that it was a relief to see oil go to 28 bucks And that was  back in 2016 you know we saw things come way down  And now it feels like a reprieve to get up to 10 or 11 And that  thats just not economic for most of our domestic production And again its affecting other parts of the  of the economy as you have mentioned  And for Wyoming were one of the largest energy producers oil natural gas Natural gas has been on the floor for a while Coal that is struggling too  CAVUTO Yes  You have not had nearly the serious coronavirus case dealings that other states have I believe the most numbers I have Governor that 436 cases to date six deaths So you havent needed to taken some of the more draconian lockdown measures some of your colleagues have  Does that mean that the measures the tentative measures you did take can be unwound sooner And can you update us what you plan to do  GORDON Sure yes Happy to do that And thank you very much for that opportunity  Eight of us Republican states all took the tack that you know our people understood common sense You ask them do the right thing they would do the right thing  We calibrated that with Dr Fauci He came and said you know I think youre doing functionally the equivalent  So we really feel like the people of Wyoming have stepped up We do see a lot of variation around the state some places a little bit more Very sadly today we had four deaths in Indian country on the Wind River Reservation something we had hoped never to see But sadly I think it speaks to the insidiousness of this  of this disease  But to your point about you know what were doing to relax since we never really closed down I have kept in close contact with all of our industries just making sure that we had the work force capacity and people were taking the precautions they needed to keep working  They have kept working And now were looking at  you may see my hair looks a little bit unkempt Were looking at ways that we can maybe relax some of the requirements we have for barbers and beauty salons and others to sort of get people back working again in these pretty workaday kinds of professions that everybody depends on  CAVUTO Governor given the limited measures you took because the limited impact was there you still encounter protesters who want to end all of this now  But youre also dealing with many residents in your state  and if national polls are accurate  who are leery about rushing back six out of 10 who feel very very leery and are anxious about the coronavirus itself  How do you balance that  GORDON Well we have really tried to find that  that sort of careful spot in between both extremes relying a little bit on our counties where we have seen higher degrees places like Teton County where theres been a higher incidence they have wanted to be a little more cautious and other counties that dont have any cases whatsoever where they have wanted to be a little more relaxed  What we have decided to do  and we will probably announce later this week  is build a dashboard that the people of Wyoming can follow along with to see if were seeing  one of the big challenges  and I know you talked about this earlier  was testing capacity  And despite what everybody says we are limited on our  on our testing capacity Were working just like every other state to get adequate tests adequate PPE Thats one of the measures that were going to look at  Another measure is how many ICU beds that we have available what their capacity requirements are the prevalence of nontraceable vs community spread Those things put them out on a dashboard and indicate to people look we want to do the right thing here  Nobody has figured out how to relax in a pandemic like this so bear with us  CAVUTO Right Right  GORDON We will keep you updated and we will do the right thing  CAVUTO Governor Gordon I have no doubt You have a beautiful state some great people Im sure it will all work out  Good health Just  just hang in there the governor of Wyoming Governor Gordon  We will be keeping track of that other states that are also pondering what the governor is pondering slowly but surely getting  getting back to work How do you do that How do you pull that off If youre in the oil market you get worried about it because you cant wait a moment too soon to get this all going but the fact of the matter is oil prices have been collapsing  And a lot of folks are saying what comes next is a lot of the wildcatters and a lot of the smaller players they go out of business Its happened in the past in the 1980s when we had a similar tumult in oil prices  But back then what transpired was all of these guys driven out and a lot of the big oil companies eventually merging That by the way was the impetus for Exxon and Mobil coming together  Lets get to read from Stephen Schork who is following this closely  Stephen it took a long time to recover from that 8283 experience a full seven years before prices bounced back up Whats going to happen now I know this is a totally different situation but the same phenomenon  STEPHEN SCHORK EDITOR THE SCHORK REPORT Yes of course Neil  And the biggest known unknown out there is when are we going to be reprieved from our house arrest The economy for all intents and purposes is dead So were looking at a situation where the supply situation here in Cushing where we have all our commercial stocks is at or nearing capacity and hence why were still seeing the weakness in the front end of the curve  If we look at the employment numbers Neil 22 million people unemployed in the last four weeks that translates into 15 million people who are not driving to work if they still have jobs when the economy opens will be commuting to work  So were looking at longterm demand destruction thats going to last for months if not years ahead So unfortunately I do believe we are looking at a systemic bear market that could signal prices lower for much longer than originally anticipated just four months ago  four weeks ago  CAVUTO All right Steve I apologize for truncating this with a lot of breaking news  But we are also watching in Washington right now where theyre working on that stimulus measure A vote could come very soon in the Senate Then it gets to the House  That could change these dynamics and the stimulus and improved economy that a lot of people like the oil people want to see  Stay with us  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right a lot of us have been streaming  Netflix numbers are outand they are offthecharts big They had almost 16 million more people streaming their servers vs the eight million expected earnings and revenues beating Street estimates by far The stock is soaring more than 5 percent in afterhours trading  Now you might recall issues like Netflix Amazon were seen to be beneficiaries have this cocooning going on across the country  This is something thats being addressed separately in Washington with a stimulus measure that will help everyone out while they are cocooning  Chad Pergram on that measure right now where theyre trying to get things goosed a little bit with first about 240250 billion for small businesses but some other addons to satisfy the Democrats  Chad where does this stand  CHAD PERGRAM FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT Well Neil the price tag keeps going up Theyre going to pass this in the Senate with a voice vote sometime in the next 20 or 30 minutes The Senate is in session right now  The total price tag is 484 billion Theyre going to have a short debate and then pass this And let me run you through some of the details here about whats actually in this package Heres the breakdown 322 billion would go towards small businesses That fund bled dry at the end of last week  Then there would be 60 billion allocated for economic disaster loans for businesses 75 billion for hospitals 25 billion for testing The final issue in the bill was over testing and they got that resolved  Now you know Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have been negotiating this McConnell said just a few minutes ago that Republicans never wanted this crucial program for workers and small business to shut down Remember they ran out of money last week  He said the Democrats let it lapse They blocked it Meantime Democrats are returning fire Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer just put out a joint statement saying  quote  Democrats flipped this emergency package from an insufficient Republican plan that left behind hospitals  So they will pass it today in the Senate sometime in the next 40 minutes Then its on to the House of Representatives on Thursday They will actually take a regular roll call vote And what they will probably have to do Neil is space people out as they go into the chamber into clumps of 20 or 30 members  Theyre just not going to bring all members all 429 members into the chamber They will space them out so they all vote And we dont think we will have a full complement of House members on hand on Thursday  It will probably be about 280 300 members and then it goes to President Trump  Neil  CAVUTO Chad thank you very very much Chad Pergram on that  In the meantime were going to be hearing from West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin where he stands on this and efforts even back in his state where some are saying open it up already lets get back to business  The protesters are out there The senator is with us  Stay with us  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right we understand theyre still talking in there New York Governor Andrew Cuomo the president of the United States  They had their dustups and differences and a little titfortat last week but were told that this was meant to be a very informal friendly affair exchanging ideas on how to deal with the coronavirus going forward  Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia joining us right now  Senator I know you have had your oneonones with the president here And you have had your differences with the president here But how do you think its going in there between the governor and the president  SEN JOE MANCHIN DWV I would think  I mean were all in this together as we all know that whether youre Democrat or Republican This virus doesnt have any preference It gets everybody  So we have got to come out of this together And I would think the professionals that they are and they should be will come together and look and see how they best come forth  New York is a very large economic engine for our country Its Wall Street and all the different things that basically make  make the financial markets stick So we have got to make sure that that comes back also  So I think that Andrew Cuomo has done a good job Hes been out there every day And the president I understand respects him for the job hes doing and also the challenge that he has in front of him  So I would think the two of them would get together And they are both New Yorkers so they sure do understand each others language That ought to work well  CAVUTO Senator how do you think the presidents been doing in handling this It depends on the governor you talk to Hes been a great help Others say well he could help more  I guess it depends on the governor What caused this rift between the governor and the president was the governor intimating that there were some things he needed did get some things he didnt get But I guess its to be expected  But how do you think its all going and how the president is doing  MANCHIN Well I think if you look at it from the standpoint what states are needing being a former governor myself there are certain things that we could do and certain things we just couldnt do without the leadership of the federal government stepping up  And I think thats the thing So the president I would  constructive criticism if you will you have got to take responsibility Look the buck does stop It stops with us If youre a governor it stops there If youre the president it stops there  But together you can come together and find our way forward The most important thing you do when you become a leader is find out the vulnerabilities that you may have in your  in our country and every governor and every mayor What vulnerabilities do your constituents have Can you prevent them from any hardship  And thats what you try to do So if you can do that and always looking ahead we can go back History is going to basically tell us where the mistakes were made and what we learned from this  The sad scenario is if we dont change and dont learn from it because no one wants to take responsibility So I would think the president says listen we all can do better OK I could do better You all can do better We all can work better together  So heres what we have learned from this We can never let this happen again Lets be prepared for the next one because it will happen And we know that And it gives us a chance to reset Neil I think manufacturing in America  We have let a lot of things go offshore And I have supported the president on clamping down on China and basically how China has taken advantage and really taken the manufacturing globally as far as taking over globally manufacturing  Now we need to bring back those necessities We know for our defense we have to be able to manufacture and have steel and aluminum And now we know for the health and wellbeing of our citizens we should be manufacturing medical devices and medicine that basically can heal us and keep us safe  Those things should be brought back with the protective  protection of the federal government  CAVUTO Senator I had a chance to talk to your Republican governor yesterday And West Virginia is among those states that might be ready sooner than others to slowly lift provisions and open up again  Are you on board with that  MANCHIN Well I mean Im cautiously on board with it I want to make sure that we get back but I want to make sure we get back safely  I think the governor feels the same way Governor Justice does would feel the same way about that  CAVUTO OK  MANCHIN It might be pushed into something prematurely  The main thing is we dont have the testing We have only tested a little over 20000 people out of 1800000 Neil we are a wonderful little state beautiful people hardworking people that basically we dont have large metropolitan areas The largest city we have is 50000  So were a state of cities and towns And those towns and cities are hurting also But with that if were going to go back I would think if youre going back  and I had some doctors I spoke to today physical therapists  they need to be tested  They want to make sure all their coworkers are tested before they come back into a work environment And next of all you have got to make sure testing is rampant that we could use it as needed to make sure that we can identify any hot spots that should be shut down or go back into basically cancellation if you will and making sure that we have separation if needed  But I think theres a proper way I dont think itll be a switch onswitch off back to full force I think itll be a rolling opening We have a lot of rural states that probably could do so much quicker than some of our larger populated areas  So we will see how it works out But Im all for lets  doing this in a very methodical way Make sure we have the testing Im told now that we can do maybe 4500 tests a day Im hoping thats accurate  If thats the case thats what 120000 or 130000 tests a month That would be great if we could Maybe we can stay on top of it I havent seen that yet Im hearing thats coming  So before they do anything I hope that happens  CAVUTO All right  MANCHIN We have to be able to test and know where we are  CAVUTO So more testing more testing no rush to reopen things just yet  Senator Joe Manchin thank you sir Very good catching up with you  MANCHIN Well thank you Neil Thank you  CAVUTO All right lets go to Matt Finn right now  Hes out in Chicago where they have been dealing with a lot of these protests that are going on around the country about delaying or continuing these provisions the sheltering and the like  Matt  MATT FINN FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Neil this afternoon hundreds of protesters rallied outside of the capitol in Missouri Many of them appeared not to be socially distanced or wearing a mask  And now Americans in more than 25 states have protested their stayathome order saying that they are just costing people their livelihoods  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE The reason here is that the lockdown it needs to end and now Studies are coming out that shows that millions of Americans have already had the coronavirus gotten over it  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE And we just feel that the stayathome order was painting with too broad of a brush And unfortunately people are being harmed because of that  END VIDEO CLIP  FINN This afternoon Michigans governor discussed health concerns that these shouldertoshoulder rallies bring recalling what she saw at a very large rally at her state capitol last week  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GOV GRETCHEN WHITMER DMI We had a lot of people show up who were not wearing masks who were not staying six feet apart  I saw adults handing things to children barehanded And we know that this kind of activity flies in the face of all of the best science including the scientists that are standing up at the nightly briefing with the president  END VIDEO CLIP  FINN Some governors have begun to release a timeline for their states gradual reopening  And the governor of Georgia is allowing many businesses to reopen this Friday  Neil  CAVUTO You know Matt when you talk to these protesters and all to a man or woman they dont make a big deal of the social distancing thing  I noticed it right away And I see them in grounds where theyre separated oftentimes by inches forget about feet And Im wondering whether they realize just how that looks  FINN There are some people perhaps on the extreme end that we have seen saying we think we may have got it we may have developed an antibody or theres plenty of people that have and will survive so were not that concerned  CAVUTO All right  FINN Some people even saying hey if this is how I go then this is how Im going to go  So there are people who are not taking any of these guidelines or advisories serious Neil  CAVUTO Incredible Just incredible  All right Matt Finn thank you very very much  You mad at China How about suing China  After this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO We are streaming and we are eating through all of this staying at home Now Chipotle out with some numbers that blew away estimates driving its digital sales up 81 percent  So were watching Netflix and eating  after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right its the world piling up on China And now so many are wondering what the country knew and when it knew it and what the World Health Organization knew and when it knew it that they really want to get to the bottom of it  But the Chinese are not complying at this point And its led to sort of a  well a global rift  Gillian Turner following it all from Washington  Hey Gillian  GILLIAN TURNER FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Hey Neil  So the US investigation into the origins of the virus in Wuhan is still ongoing But our sources today tell us they dont yet have an estimate of when theyre going to wrap up when theyre going to present their findings to the Trump administration  Our sources are also telling us that as of now the White House has not given them a timing directive Theyre allowing the intel process to kind of play out on its own  Today the national security adviser said one major problem is that Chinas government is still denying access to the key areas to health officials Take a listen  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  ROBERT OBRIEN US NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER We need to get the CDC into China Theres really a huge burden on China to tell us where this came from  END VIDEO CLIP  TURNER Now the claim that China is blocking efforts by the US to get eyes on the ground is echoing across the government from the National Security Council to the intel community even President Trump himself  And as international pressure is continuing to mount for an expanded investigation led by a whole coalition of countries Chinas governments now making it clear where they stand Take a listen  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE through translator China resolutely opposes any country or organization interfering in Chinas internal affairs in Chinas judicial sovereignty under any pretext  END VIDEO CLIP  TURNER Neil a word on Kim Jongun lots of reports about his health today  Our official sources are not confirming that he is incapacitated as other outlets have done But we did manage to confirm that the US government has pretty extensive contingency plans in place in the eventuality of a Kim Jongun death what that would look like for North Korea what the US would do what other countries around the world would do  Neil  CAVUTO Because the North Koreans havent said anything about it Right I mean were just going on speculation right  TURNER Yes so far no confirmation from North Korea which is very unsurprising  CAVUTO Right  TURNER This story broke last night with reporting from a South Korean news agency but US officials are not saying  they know and admit that hes been in poor health for a while He has cardio problems  But theyre not confirming anything Theyre not certain right now about what his current condition is Neil  CAVUTO All right thank you very much Gillian Turner in Washington  Back to this whole China thing and whether theyre hiding stuff from us whether you can believe any of the counts and cases theyre giving or the fact that only a few thousand died when in this country its a multiple of that many many times Does it make sense  So a lot of people are starting to say it started there they hid some stuff from there its time to sue from here  Well that might be easier said than done  Judge Andrew Napolitano with us on that  There are some sketchy precedents for this But its a tough one right Judge  ANDREW NAPOLITANO FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST Well its nearly impossible right now because of the Sovereign Immunity Act which prevents federal courts in America from hearing cases against sovereign countries  So theoretically if someone wanted to sue China today before any amendment to that act theyd have to go to China to Beijing and sue in a Chinese court Good luck  As you know because you have reported this there are members of the Senate who are offering legislation which would amend the Sovereign Immunity Act to allow Americans to sue the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party for a deception of such a magnitude that it caused horrific human death here in federal courts  I dont think that works either because the federal courts are not capable of determining exactly how this spread and who caused it to happen and who lied and who deceived it about  deceived us about it  The flip side of this is that the Sovereign Immunity Act is bilateral meaning it prevents Chinese people from suing the American government in Chinese courts which of course is the last thing we want because they own so many of our assets  CAVUTO You know you just think of where you have cases of terrorist acts the downing a Pan Am Flight 103 comes to mind and all where you could trace it to a country and sue that country  And then you would have to question the leaders of that country to make it happen Were a long way from that here arent we  NAPOLITANO We are a long way from that It would require amending a lot of statutes  CAVUTO Right  NAPOLITANO I mean terrorism requires two or more acts of violence intended to change the policy of the government So theyd have to redefine terrorism and redefine a lot of laws  But the courts will probably say this is not justiciable meaning it is not for the judicial branch to resolve Its for the executive branch to resolve through politics or diplomacy or economics or even military but theres nothing the courts can do about it  I dont blame these members of Congress for exploring this because they represent people who are furious at what happened  CAVUTO Right  NAPOLITANO And Gillians report is really just the tip of the iceberg as to what probably happened  And when we learn what truly happened people will be livid But because of our economic and political relationships with China right now theres very little that anybody other than the president can do about it  CAVUTO All right Judge thank you very much Good catching up with you my friend  Were still watching at the White House right now where the president and the governor of New York are still meeting They have pushed back that health care task force briefing to 530 pm a little less than an hour from now So we might get an update from that then but outside of that and seeing the governor or seeing anything else so far not  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right I want to correct something I said earlier  That meeting has wrapped up now between the president and Governor Cuomo It actually wrapped up about 10 minutes ago I understand There was no photo availability or no posttape that became available  The governor left Were told it was an amicable discussion Thats about all we know So I apologize for that confusion  But all of this occurs the same hour that were learning right now the United States has surpassed 800000 coronavirus cases as of this hour in New York by the way 257125 cases by far the heaviest number of cases in New York New Jersey is a distance second at about 88806  But again these  just the sheer number of cases and the rate of increase while coming down is still going up And thats something we watch very very closely  And that is among the reasons why we have this measure being voted on in the United States Senate soon to go to the House that will call for still more backup to help those affected by this shutdown thats been going on throughout much of the country  This is that 484 billion measure in the Senate expected to easily get past that and then in the House But already we have seen a bipartisanship agreement where all the key players including Nancy Pelosi and Republican leaders are saying this is all but a done deal  Mike Emanuel has been following the drama on Capitol Hill and updates us right now  Hey Mike  MIKE EMANUEL FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT Well Neil good afternoon  Yes once theres an agreement between those key players on Capitol Hill and signoff from the White House things tend to move rather quickly on Capitol Hill Its rare A lot of times theres plenty of bickering And they certainly did their share of bickering over recent days  But they have come together You had initially the Republicans saying they just wanted to extend that small business program known as the Paycheck Protection Program that had run out of cash Democrats said there are other priorities that they wanted to include  So theyre going to get 25 billion more for testing That is something that we know that Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York is speaking with the president of the United States about this afternoon just wrapped up short time ago but a lot of concerns about testing  How do you reopen the economy without more vigorous testing And so thats part of the package All indications are the Senate should act in the next few minutes pass this measure  And then we know a lot of House lawmakers are in the process of traveling from their respective districts back to Capitol Hill to have at least a quorum for a vote on Thursday morning Its expected to pass there with the signoff of the relevant leaders in the House but they have to have at least a quorum of 216 or so members around to pass it and send it on to the president for his signature  Neil  CAVUTO You know Mike a dumb question my part but youre used to them  And one is that this testing thats included in the legislation Governor Cuomo had argued I believe last week at this time that that is a federal government responsibility He later acquiesced on that to say he was wrong that its a state responsibility  Now if its included in this legislation in other words to help states with more testing I guess it becomes a moot point doesnt it  EMANUEL Yes  My understanding was that part of the reason the governor wanted to come speak face to face with the president rather than talking past one another in media appearances was to essentially sort out what is the federal government going to commit to doing in terms of greater testing and what should governors focus on to do in terms of greater testing  Obviously its in the presidents interest to reopen New York a key driver of the American economy But as you know in the New York City area people live on top of one another very closely together  CAVUTO Right  EMANUEL And so there are a lot of people who feel like you cant open mass transit which is critical in New York City and the surrounding areas without knowing whether people have been tested and whether they are clear or whether they may be carrying coronavirus  Imagine coronavirus spreading around New York City subway trains And so obviously theyre not there yet And so the governor wanted to sort out with the president whats the states responsibility whats the feds responsibility We should get more from the president when he comes out and does his daily briefing a little later Neil  CAVUTO All right Mike Emanuel thank you very much  We might get a read on that after this  EMANUEL You bet  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right we interrupt this sure stimulus thing for a no from Senator Rand Paul  He is addressing the Senate right now or talking about how he cannot vote for it Hes opposed to it He says that we should quit printing bailout cash Rand Paul  JOINED IN PROGRESS  SEN RAND PAUL RKY  only comes when the quarantine is ended  Now experts will disagree on the exact date that we should reopen the economy but sane rational counsel should continue to push for the quickest end possible  Opining about never shaking hands again is a recipe for keeping the economy closed until no one dies from infectious disease Well the infectious disease experts should be queried So too should economists  We should seek counsel about balancing the harm to health caused by disease with the harm to health caused by enforcing dysfunction on the economy not easy decisions  Perhaps most importantly leaders in each state must weigh in on the problem New York Citys open date will be different than Fargo North Dakota We need to get past a onesizefitsall approach to infectious disease  Realize that most of this money thats being loaned to small business is not a loan Most of this money will not be repaid It will ultimately be considered grants and will be added to our national debt Lets be honest about this  Applications for the program opened to overwhelming initial demand The current data indicates that the moneys gone So now here we are again with leadership from both parties saying lets do another 300 billion Whats another couple hundred billion  But realize the money desired is not money that we have saved for a rainy day This money doesnt exist anywhere It will be created or borrowed  Even more alarming than the money is the idea that one senator can stand on the floor and pass legislation spending a halfatrillion dollars and have no recorded vote and no debate  Look I understand the hardships of senators returning from around the country So I have not invoked the Senate rules to demand a recorded vote I did return today though so that history will record that not everyone gave in to the massive debt Congress is creating  My hope is that across the country there will remain a vibrant voice for limited government for our constitutional republic I dont want to see this massive  CAVUTO All right that is Senator Rand Paul right now He is opposing this nearly halftrilliondollar coronavirus bill that is just keeping the cash spigot going here and says that we have got to watch out whats happening on the debt  We have spent trillions of dollars thus far Why this is the ending point we shall see  Lets go to John Roberts at the White House on where this goes  John I dont think its going to get in the way of getting this thing through  ROBERTS no  CAVUTO But it now kind of a seminal moment What do you make of it  ROBERTS You know they have got the votes to do it And Rand Paul gets to stand up there and espouse his principles and still the PPP will go out and there will be another 310 billion or so of that  The coronavirus briefing this afternoon just a little more than halfan hour from now we expect the president will probably give his side of the meeting that he had with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo a little while ago  Cuomo was on another network talking about it Sounded like the two of them had a good conversation Cuomo was talking about the importance of federal involvement in getting testing supplies out to the states that there needs to be a robust partnership in doing that  Apparently the president asked Cuomo how things were going in New York how some of the treatments were working So it sounds like Neil I would expect when the president comes out for the coronavirus briefing and starts talking about that he will probably talk about Cuomo who he has been at odds with many times in the past in a probably very I dont want to say glowing terms but I think probably very cordial terms and this idea that Cuomo is the governor of his home state  So Im sure youre President Trump wants to see things go well in New York City And even though they have had disagreements in the past over who needs to do what and President Trump told Cuomo to stop talking and Cuomo told President Trump to get off the couch stop watching TV and get to work I think they had a pretty good meeting today at least by Cuomos account  We will get the presidents account soon  Neil  CAVUTO Who decides at the White House if they dont want to have like a delayed tape or one of those tapebacked moments I mean thats the presidents call right  ROBERTS Theres one person who makes all of those decisions and he lives right there  LAUGHTER  CAVUTO I got that  Real quickly John on the stimulus thats being voted on that Rand Paul dislikes there is a portion carved out there to provide governors help in getting these tests something that Governor Cuomo wanted  It is a federal responsibility He said he was corrected when it wasnt But he got what he wanted right  ROBERTS Yes and I think not just New York state but other states did as well  CAVUTO Right  ROBERTS And the federal role here is in making sure that the national suppliers have the equipment necessary to go out to the states things like testing swabs like specimen test tubes like reagent that comes from certain manufacturers so you can do those PCR tests  Those are the things that the states want the federal government to supply But President Trump is still firm in saying look the federal government doesnt stand on street corners sticking swabs up peoples noses Thats the states job to do  And Vice President Mike Pence had a conversation with the nations 50 governors yesterday saying heres all the testing capacity you have in your states You need to know where it is You need to learn how to use it  CAVUTO All right John Roberts thank you very very much my friend John Roberts at the White House  He will be at that briefing in about a halfanhour  That will do it for us "},
{"2176": " Multiple patients infected with   were transferred to the hospital ship Comfort from the Javits Center in New York by mistake three US officials tell Fox News The number of Covid19 patients brought on board the hospital ship was estimated to be “less than five” one official said The information had not been previously reported The patients were transferred sometime Friday according to the officials At the time that the patients were transferred to the hospital ship the initial screening did not indicate they were positive officials said The top general leading the coronavirus response for the US military told Fox News there was another COVID19 patient who showed up to the hospital ship Comfort in New York earlier Saturday after being delivered by ambulance The patient later tested positive on board while in isolation “We are treating the emergency situation that needs to be treated” Air Force Gen Terrence OShaughnessy said in a phone interview with Fox News Saturday afternoon and disclosed the new case aboard Comfort  While Navy officials say the handful of previously unknown COVID19 patients testing positive for the virus on board is proof the protocols put in place are working it’s also a sign of the complexity this pandemic presents for medical personnel battling the pandemic in New York Until Friday the 3000bed makeshift hospital at the Javit Center only treated nonCOVID19 patients  One day earlier President Trump approved New York Gov Andrew Cuomo’s request to have Javits treat COVID patients That meant all the patients at Javits  a few dozen in all  had to be sent to the hospital ship Comfort about 10 blocks away  Some of those patients later tested positive on board as Fox News first reported Saturday afternoon The hospital ship is located on Pier 90 on Manhattan’s west side and arrived in New York Monday  The vessel has a “couple dozen” patients on board right now according to chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman Part of the protocol before receiving patients onboard Comfort is for a coronavirus test to be performed  The swab test came back hours later the patients remained in isolation and spent a night onboard the vessel which is only supposed to treat trauma patients not Covid19 positive patients About a dozen patients from the Javits Center in midtown Manhattan were transferred to the hospital ship Comfort one day after President Trump approved New York Gov Cuomo’s request to have Covid19 patients treated at the Javits Center All the patients at Javits Center were then transferred to the hospital ship a short distance away where they were isolated and tested for the novel coronavirus Up to the point of embarking aboard the hospital ship the patients had only filled out a questionnaire and had their temperature taken as part of an initial screening process It’s been   that half of people infected with coronavirus  show no symptoms according to the latest data The Covid19 positive patients have already been delivered back to the Javits center Saturday morning to continue their treatment one official said The Javits Center has been transformed into a 3000 bed makeshift hospital by the Army Corps of Engineers The officials called the risk to the hospital ship’s crew “low” because of the protocols were already in place “We were prepared with a contingency plan in case we received patients that later tested positive Immediately upon arrival the patients were isolated while awaiting the test results” the official added Another official pointed out this was why the hospital ship did not want to fill all 1000 beds on board too quickly because the risk of the virus coming on board is so great The Comfort crew is scrubbing the area where the patients were housed on board  All US Navy medical personnel were wearing complete PPE personal protective equipment the officials added “We have infectious disease specialists on board as well” another official said Cmdr Ashley Hockycko spokeswoman for US Second Fleet told Fox News While admitting patients who were transferred to USNS Comfort for treatment a few patients tested positive for COVID19 The Comfort has infection control procedures that are followed just like hospitals ashore Our medical experts on board are well prepared for cases like this and have taken the appropriate precautionary measures The patients were isolated and received care aboard the ship while working to transfer the patients as soon as practical to the Javits Federal Medical Station which is treating COVID19 patients The Comfort is capable of continuing its mission” Right now both hospital ships Comfort in New York and Mercy in Los Angeles do not take Covid19 patients but top Pentagon leaders are “reassessing” that policy the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen Mark Milley told Fox News’ Harris Faulkner Friday afternoon That decision is “not imminent” a Pentagon spokesman later said in a press conference Friday The coronavirus has claimed the lives of 3500 people in New York a number that has doubled since Wednesday"},

America remains shut down the more longterm economic damage we will see As we continue to focus on treating and saving the people who are currently ill it is essential to determine in parallel how we can reopen the country while also preventing future spikes in cases and possibly even deaths if we lessen the socialdistance measures A highly contagious virus – like the coronavirus – that can possibly be aerosolized will wax and wane throughout the seasons and is likely here to stay at least for the next couple of years So while there are numerous research studies being performed throughout the country to determine which medications have the best treatment outcomes against the virus we can’t wait for the large randomizedcontrol studies to conclude And we can’t wait for a vaccine to save the day Rather we have to look at the evidence before us albeit limited in an effort to improve our treatment outcomes and decrease the rate of hospitalization with COVID19 The shift in how we deal with COVID19 needs to go from the inpatient setting in hospitals to bring outpatient physicians to the frontlines for our future progress Our outpatient medical practices have been forced to cancel “elective procedures” even if postponing the procedures potentially holds a greater fatality rate than COVID19 would This was done to lessen the burden on the hospital system but it has left us with a largely untapped resource to fight the coronavirus outpatient medicine Resources – including testing kits personal protective equipment medications personnel and even government funding – have been focused on inpatient hospital settings leaving other medical specialties and patients out In a state of emergency like the one we have been in this may have been appropriate But to stay in such a myopic state would be futile to longterm efforts As we reopen business while the novel coronavirus still circulates we will need to streamline outpatient care to decrease the number of people who may require hospital care so we don’t need makeshift hospitals set up in convention centers and even Central Park in New York City The way to do this is to increase outpatient care and redistribute resources We will do this while allowing people who have been exposed or presumed to have been exposed to the coronavirus to return to work while adhering to the White House recommendations of wearing a mask in tightfitting spaces temporarily lowering maximum capacities of small spaces and continuing to encourage some form of social distancing Yet we cannot begin to think of opening the country unless elected officials remove their hands from health care and allow the transition of resources to pointofcare sites in order to prevent spiking of the curve This will only be done by allowing testing and treatment to be provided by outpatient doctors with the resumption of home visits and allocation of more funding for outpatient management There is a continuous discussion about fasttrack antibody testing However if it rolls out the same way the molecular nasal swab test rolled out state legislators would likely dictate and restrict the antibody testing as they have already done with the nasal swab test Physicians across the country are even being slapped with subpoenas from US attorney offices for prescribing medications to people with COVID19 in hopes of treating their illness State legislators are restricting doctors from prescribing certain medications to only established patients with a COVID19 positive test Except if you haven’t noticed getting tested is not the easiest thing to do There are reports all across the country of physicians applying to have testing in their offices – given high patient populations – only to be denied repeatedly by government officials If doctors can’t get tests for their patients – and are not able to prescribe potential treatments for them once symptomatic – how are they to help prevent the patients from needing hospitalization When patients are showing symptoms of COVID19 doctors should be able to prescribe the best weapons at their disposal – including home oxygen pulse oximeters intravenous fluids and medications It is indefensible for states to withhold any such measures while patients wait days or weeks for a positive coronavirus test to come back or while symptoms worsen to the point the patients require hospitalization The acting director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in New Jersey contradicted himself in his own statement about the order saying “Medical professionals have a duty to make conscientious prescribing and dispensing decisions that ensure every patient is able to obtain their medication This includes only issuing prescriptions necessary for the treatment of patients and in reasonable quantities to ensure continuity of care for all who rely on them” Yet state government actions directly inhibit medical professionals from making conscientious prescribing decisions for their patients coming to their offices with symptoms of illness Isn’t that what a physician is supposed to do Governors across the country including Phil Murphy of New Jersey have issued executive orders threatening doctors with punitive measures if they prescribe certain medications for their COVID19 patients While COVID19 usually presents as an acute respiratory infectious illness it can damage multiple organ systems – including the heart lungs and blood Most adults with COVID19 experience fever cough and fatigue and then recover within one to three weeks However some develop severe illness typically manifesting as pneumonia and respiratory failure with continued progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death Currently no specific treatment has been confirmed with robust clinical trials to prevent the progression of COVID19 to severe illness However several medicines available in the United States have been proposed as potential therapies A continuing discussion about one of those medications – hydroxychloroquine HCQ – has consumed news organizations since President Trump mentioned it during a White House press briefing several weeks ago In the last month several small studies have found that hydroxychloroquine showed promise in a lab setting against the virus that causes COVID19 with preliminary reports suggesting potential effectiveness in small subsets of human patients Because of this glimmer of hope the medication – among many others – is undergoing clinical trials in patients in an effort to decrease the devastating effects of the global coronavirus pandemic An   recently published by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons highlights the basic science and clinical outcomes reported from more than 10 countries that show HCQ working both before and after COVID19 enters the cells It is the viral replication process once inside the human body that triggers the “cytokine storm” that is wreaking havoc on various organ systems – especially the lungs – leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and sometimes death The addition of a particular antibiotic has demonstrated a synergistic effect as reported from France China and several  An   conducted by the global health care polling company Sermo showed that out of the 2171 physicians surveyed 37 percent rated hydroxychloroquine as the “most effective therapy” for combating the potentially deadly illness COVID19 Outside the US hydroxychloroquine is being equally used for diagnosed patients with mild to severe COVID19 symptoms The US Food and Drug Administration FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for HCQ to treat COVID19 – but restricted this approval to hospitalized patients only We live in a country with the most economic and privacy freedoms yet our health care professionals are being restricted more than anywhere else in the world by not allowing treatment to prevent hospitalization This is a reactive and backward approach to caring for the patient The data we have suggests the use of hydroxychloroquine as a first intention therapy for COVID19 patients may help shorten the duration of illness and possibly reduce the severity We won’t know for certain until we have longerterm randomized control studies telling us But when we are dealing with people rapidly deteriorating and dying by the thousands every day decisions based on anecdotal evidence may actually be good enough This is especially true when those decisions involve medications that have proven safe from decades of utilization for other ailments Would this drug combination have been considered too brash and controversial if anyone other than President Trump mentioned it Probably not And it’s not just governors substituting their judgment for those of doctors that pose a threat to frontline medical responders Sen Lamar Alexander RTenn – who has been the   of campaign contributions from insurance companies – is callously trying to   this crisis to cut physicians’ pay Instead of holding insurance companies accountable for their draconian methods Alexander – along with Rep Walden ROre and Frank Pallone DNJ – is carrying their water by concocting an outofnetwork reimbursement plan that is akin to government ratesetting At a time when doctors and other frontline responders are risking their lives to combat the coronavirus pandemic it is unfathomable that any politician would attempt to hurt them financially But here we are – robbing Peter to pay Paul – except Peter is too busy saving lives to fight the battle on Capitol Hill That’s why just as we need to remind governors to stay out of medicine we need to demand that elected officials in Washington stay out of health care providers’ pockets Government officials should remove the red tape from physicians and allow us to deliver on our oath to care for our patients We have spent decades pouring through literature and academic studies in an effort to make appropriate decisions for our patients regarding their care Those in government should not tell us what an “elective” surgical intervention is or which treatment is best for our patients The last person who needs a say in patient care is a politician who has never seen a patient suffer So my message to elected officials who believe they know best is simple remove the shackles and let health care professionals do our jobs"},

Congressman Eleanor Holmes Norton who says its time to move controversial statues to museums  Plus new polls show Joe Biden pulling away from Donald Trump in battleground states Well ask our Sunday panel what to make of Bidens big lead four months from Election Day  All right now on FOX News Sunday  END VIDEOTAPE  WALLACE And hello again from FOX News in Washington  There are new calls this weekend for Americans to embrace social distancing as coronavirus cases surge across the South and West The virus now blame for 125000 deaths and more than 2 million infections  And the White House Coronavirus Task Force which until Friday had not held a briefing in two months now says its considering a new testing strategy  In a moment well talk with former CDC director Dr Tom Frieden  But first lets bring in David Spunt at the White House with the latest on efforts to contain the pandemic  David  DAVID SPUNT FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Chris the president insists he has this pandemic under control despite the rising number of cases Vice President Mike Pence has canceled upcoming campaign events this week because of those rising numbers  BEGIN VIDEOTAPE  SPUNT As infections continue to climb parts of the Southern United States are beginning to close once again  ERIC JOHNSON D DALLAS MAYOR Wear a mask This is the single most important thing that you can do to slow the spread of

was in compliance with local guidelines and everyone who attended that rally Chris was provided with face masks and hand sanitizer  Chris  WALLACE David Spunt reporting from the White House David thank you  And joining us now former CDC director Dr Tom Frieden  Doctor I want to start with the spread of the virus these past few weeks There was on Friday more than 45000 new cases a new single day high for our country And 13 states set record highs for the seven day average of new cases But Vice President Pence said this  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MIKE PENCE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES We have made truly remarkable progress in moving our nation forward Weve all seen the encouraging news as we open up America again  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Doctor are we making truly remarkable progress and is that the right message to be sending to the nation at this moment  DR TOM FRIEDEN FORMER CDC DIRECTOR Well theres no doubt were doing more testing our hospitals are better prepared but theres also no doubt that the virus has the upper hand  This virus is not going to go away on its own We have to stop it and only we can do that by working together  But we are all sick and tired of staying home but you know what the virus is not tired of making us sick And what were seeing particularly in southern states but in most parts of the US is the virus increasing and in some states increasing explosively  WALLACE Let me drill down on that how do you explain the new surge in cases especially in the South and the West Did some states in those regions did they open up too soon  reopen too soon and without enough restrictions  FRIEDEN Well Chris as I said to you six weeks ago today this is going to backfire Were moving too fast  If you open when cases are still increasing as many states did its like leaning into a left hook Youre going to get hit hard and thats whats happening  When we see Arizona Texas Florida South Carolina they are currently in a rapid upswing and sad to say this is going to continue to get worse for weeks Because the physical distancing that theyre implementing now will only take effect  you wont see it for another few weeks so we are going to see a few more weeks of increases in all likelihood in several states  Now theres some comfort in the fact that its younger people but what starts in the young doesnt stay in the young Younger people have parents uncles nephews they go out to places to buy food and we are going to see increasing spread  Thats why the three Ws are so important wear a mask wash your hands or use sanitizer and watch your distance Theres something everyone can do We are really all in this together and if we work together we can help control the virus and get our economy back  Public health and health issues are not getting in the way of our recovery they are the route to our recovery  WALLACE Doctor one of the arguments you hear is that the reason we are seeing a surge in new cases is because we are seeing a surge in more testing Heres President Trump on that this week  BEGIN CLIP  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES We have more cases because we do the greatest testing If we didnt do testing wed have no cases  END CLIP  WALLACE Is this surge a function of more testing or is it a reflection of the fact that the virus is actually spreading  FRIEDEN As a doctor scientist an epidemiologist I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that in most states where youre seeing an increase it is a real increase It is not more tests it is more spread of the virus And the one number to look at thats very important is the percent of tests thats positive  The number of cases that can vary some because we are only diagnosing 10 20 percent of all cases So the numbers youre seeing are just a reflection a tip of the iceberg of even more spread  But where the numbers are increasing you got Arizona with nearly one out of four tests positive and at the same time you are increasing the number of tests I can tell you with absolute certainty thats explosive spread of coronavirus  WALLACE While were seeing the number of cases explode up 65 percent in the last two weeks we are seeing the number of deaths actually drop 27 percent How do you explain that  FRIEDEN There are a few things going on First off deaths will lag cases by about a month It takes some time for someone to feel sick get hospitalized and unfortunately die  Second the cases do appear to be in younger people now and the death rate is far far far lower in younger people than older But as I said earlier what starts in young adults doesnt stay in young adults So there may be a lag until we see cases Its possible that older people are shielding themselves more and we are also getting better at caring for the disease at hospitals  So the explosive spread isnt being followed yet by an explosive increase in deaths but what we are seeing in some states already is a big increase in intensive care unit admissions and thats a sign that this is not benign this is going to result in more deaths We estimate in the next month we will see at least 15000 more deaths in the US  WALLACE Meanwhile this has all become even more of a political issue as everything seems to be in this country Seventysix percent of Democrats say that they wear a mask all or most of the time as compared to 53 percent of Republicans And this week 3000 young supporters of the president packed a church in Arizona as you can see on the screen here almost none of them wearing masks  Here was Vice President Pence  BEGIN CLIP  PENCE The freedom of speech and the right to peacefully assemble is enshrined in the Constitution of the United States And even in a health crisis the American people dont forfeit our constitutional rights  END CLIP  WALLACE Im asking you this as the former head of the CDC one of the leading public health experts in the country as a matter of public health not a matter of constitutional law what do you think when you see hundreds thousands of people close together indoors not wearing masks  FRIEDEN The science is clear more people with less ventilation indoors with a high rate of coronavirus not wearing masks that is a formula for explosive spread of the virus  WALLACE Finally President Trump continues to say that we are going to see a vaccine his words very soon Perhaps by  before the end of the year What is the likelihood of that Give us a reality check on one we can really begin to think about a vaccine  FRIEDEN Although were seeing really encouraging progress theres now evidence that people do get immunity it may be protective there are more than 100 vaccine candidates being evaluated some of them are looking good in some preliminary studies Its really hard to develop a vaccine because you have to make sure its safe Theres already too much suspicion about vaccines we cant cut any corners  We have to make sure its safe its effective figure out the right dose decide whos going to get it first develop it manufacture large quantities get it out there set up systems to track for bad reactions This is not a quick fix its really important to do  its the single most important thing we can do to fight coronavirus and thats why its so important we have to do it carefully We cant cut any corners  We may have it next year but what having it means means ph a little different it means that people are going to start to have availability for health care workers for example but we have to make sure its safe and effective before we put it into peoples arms  WALLACE Dr Frieden thank you Thanks for your time Always good to talk with you sir  FRIEDEN Thank you  WALLACE Up next the growing debate over how our nation should deal with race both current problems and past symbols Well get two very different perspectives when we come right back  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE Protesters in American streets are calling for the country to address our racial tensions both current inequities and contentious symbols of Americas past But how to do that is a key question  For one perspective lets begin with Hawk Newsome head of Black Lives Matter Greater New York  Mr Newsome you created quite a stir this week when you spoke with my colleague Martha MacCallum Lets take a look at what you said  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  HAWK NEWSOME BLACK LIVES MATTER GREATER NEW YORK If this country doesnt give us what we want then we will burn down this system and replace it all right And I could be speaking figuratively I could be speaking literally Its a matter of interpretation  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Afterwards President Trump tweeted his reaction to your statement  This is treason sedition insurrection  Question sir what you accomplish with rhetoric like that How do you think that helps  NEWSOME Well heres the thing a lot of people dont understand how the streets or the people feel I have an indepth knowledge for this I live in the Bronx I live amongst the people  So its not like Im sitting here pushing a button or anyone can push that button But if people keep seeing these images of their babies of their relatives of black people being killed they keep dealing with financial inequality and inequity and it reaches a point of frustration then people lash out  This is a matter of inevitability that people will lash out because theyre feeling like theyre backed into a corner  WALLACE But just two years ago back in 2018 you gave a Ted Talk in which you preached nonviolence and talked about how during the riots in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray you tried to stop the violence I want to play clip of you from just two years ago  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  NEWSOME Do you have love in your heart Do you love your neighbor Do you believe in the Bible the Koran Do you believe in your religious teachings Because I guarantee you all of them tell you to help your neighbor  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE That man wouldnt have talked about working to burn down the system What happened  NEWSOME Well what you have to understand is overtime  how about this Im not encouraging people to go out and hurt other people Thats not what Im promoting  What Im talking about is systemic inequality What Im talking about is America treating crime as  as something that needs to be handled with policing instead of defunding the police and looking at crime from the perspective that its a health crisis  The same way we looked at heroin addiction when it was only black people as tough on drugs war on crime We have  and when it became white people we looked at it as a public health crisis as something that needs to be treated  Thats the way we need to look at crime OK You think about police Over 80 percent of the calls are not violent felonies Therefore we should really look and see why police are being called  Look at the causes of why people are committing crimes They are desperate Theyre poor Theyre undereducated and they are left out to dry but this American system of government  So if you want to decrease crime you dont hire police to come in and arrest everybody and brutalize people If you want to cure crime then you must go to the source You must invest in people you must give people jobs  You must make people employable Places with the highest murder rates have the highest rates of unemployment  So lets start talking about entrepreneurship programs in our communities Lets start talking about schools that actually meet the needs of people Thats something we can do with the 100 billion   WALLACE Let me  let me just   NEWSOME  that this country spends on police  WALLACE But Mr Newsome let me pick up on this Were going to have Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton on next whos been a leader in the civil rights movement for years Shes working in Congress right now to try to pass policing legislation  She says if you want to see a statue removed you dont tear it down You go through the proper legal channels whether its Congress or the city council  There has been a split in the civil rights movement the AfricanAmerican community for at least a half a century now between Malcolm X and by any means necessary on the one hand and Martin Luther King and working through the system on the other  Didnt MLK get a lot more done in a practical sense  NEWSOME I believe that Dr Martin Luther King Jr was a brilliant strategist especially in the form of media savvy But what we have to understand is black people do not trust politicians They dont trust black  they dont trust Democrats they dont trust Republicans  Black people also have a problem with the government overstepping its bounds The biggest manifestation of that is policing  So if you want to make government smaller then you address police on that scale  If you talk about the rift in the civil rights movement our elders a lot of them have been bought ph off by the Democratic establishment right And they pretty much go with the flow of the Democratic establishment And what you have to understand is 50 percent  maybe sometime 60 percent of the people out there protesting are young white people and you want to write them off and call them Antifa or this or that  But you have corporate lawyers you have Ivy League graduates who are out there protesting right Stop trying to vilify those who are out there fighting and try to understand why theyre out there fighting  Theyre fighting because the government has failed us The government spends too much money on failing programs The government is beholden to corporations right  Like you look at Wells Fargo and you stop me from going on a tangent You look at Wells Fargo right and how they paid out a billion dollars in settlements for discriminatory practices but they got bailouts from Obama and they got bailouts from Trump during COVID  You look at how this country is beholden to corporations and people feel betrayed  WALLACE Mr Newsome thank you  NEWSOME Yes  WALLACE I have a lot more Id like to talk about but we have only an hour today Thank you Thanks for joining us  And now lets turn to Washington DC Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton who I guess is kind of who Hawk Newsome was talking about a member of the Democratic establishment a politician You just heard Mr Newsom Whats your reaction  REP ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON D WASHINGTON DC My reaction is I completely understand Ive been in the streets myself enough to understand that impatience But you send people like me to the Congress of the United States to do something about it And thats what we are doing now Youve never seen I think a reaction at least from Democrats in the Congress as quickly as youve seen after the George Floyd demonstrations You saw a policing bill come forward You  you are beginning to see reactions or actions precisely brought on by people like your guests who are impatient and are saying do something and so something quick so much so that  that the  the   WALLACE But  but Congresswoman  Congresswoman let   NORTON Go ahead  WALLACE Excuse me Let me  let me just break in though because you know as I discussed with Mr Newsome there has been this split in tactics and strategy and viewpoints for more than half a century between the kind of Malcolm X by any means necessary and Martin Luther King  You have done things your way working through the system but can understand how someone like Hawk Newsome or the tens of thousands of people in the street would say wait a minute you know you  youve been doing it your way and we have the death of George Floyd and a lot more police brutality We have the economic inequities that hes talking about We see how the coronavirus is hitting minority communities much harder than it is white communities And maybe they conclude the Eleanor Holmes Norton way isnt working  NORTON Well the Eleanor Holmes Norton way is sending some to Congress to do something about it Thats what Eleanor Holmes Norton is doing You mentioned Malcolm X and Dr Martin Luther King And before Malcolm X died he was reconciled with Martin Luther King The impatience in the streets is why we have the legislation that would pass the policing act in Congress last week The people  the streets have spoken to the people they send to Congress And  and that is how a democracy works Thats what we want to see  WALLACE But Congresswoman  but congressman use  Congresswoman you say this is how a democracy works The fact is that Democrats in the Senate blocked the Republican bill because they said they were given no input in the House Democrats passed a bill without any Republican input The result of it is it looks like both sides did the same thing and nothing is going to get past  NORTON Well I  I disagree Since the Republicans have a bill a policing bill in  in the Congress  I mean in the Senate weve passed a bill in the House What that leads to is people looking at those bills and getting together Let them pass their bill Just as we have passed our bills Then there will be a conference And we will decide   WALLACE But the Democrats  it was the Democrats in the Senate who blocked the Republicans from passing their bill So there is nothing to have a conference about  NORTON They  they blocked it because the bill  they  they blocked it that is to say they would not agree to any part of it because it was a disgrace It  it  it didnt even rise to the level of  of a remedy And by the way Im not sure I would have blocked their bill Perhaps their bill should have been exposed and voted and  and put them on the record about their bill  WALLACE Ever since the death of George Floyd President Trump has talked a great deal about law and order And on Friday he issued an executive order to  to back up the protection of these historical statues on federal property Here is the president this week  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP Were going to get tougher and tougher And at some point theres going to be retribution because there has to be These people are vandals but their agitators but theyre really  theyre terrorists in a sense  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE You must know that millions of Americans agree with the president and dont want to see looting dont want to see vandalism even if they disagree with the salutes dont want to see them taken down by a mob  NORTON And I agree on that score Thats why theres legislation pending to take down these  these statues  I have put a bill in to take down a statue of people took down before the bill could get through the Albert Pike statue He may have been the worst of them He mutilated the bodies of Union soldiers and was forced to resign in disgrace by his own men  We hope  we  we would hope that we would be given the opportunity to do this in regular order because you have a Congress at least in  in the House of Representatives that is showing its willing to do it But I dont  I  I dont misunderstand at all either your prior guests or people in the streets I do not endorse vandalism as a way to deal with what were seeing in the streets Thats what they sent people like me to Congress four  WALLACE Congresswoman Norton we should also point out that the House for the first time this week passed a bill that would make Washington DC where you live and I live the 51st state We are  I promise you well have you back soon to talk about that and its chances of getting through the Senate where Republicans say they oppose it or to the White House where the president says he opposes it  But Congresswoman thank you so much Thanks for talking with us And please come back  NORTON My pleasure  WALLACE Up next well bring in our Sunday group to discuss Joe Bidens growing lead over President Trump in key swing states  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CHRIS WALLACE Coming up knew polls show Joe Biden leading in key battleground states and the president has noticed  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES The man cant speak And hes going to be your president because some people dont love me may  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Well ask our Sunday panel what it will take for the president to turn things around next  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  SEAN HANNITY FOX HOST Whats at stake in this election as you compare and contrast and what is  what are your top priority items for a second term  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES I never did this before I never slept over in Washington I was in Washington I think 17 times All of a sudden Im president of the United States  But I didnt know very many people in Washington It wasnt my thing I was from Manhattan from New York Now I know everybody And I have great people in the administration  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE President Trump with Sean Hannity this week offering few specifics about his plans for a second term  And its time now for our Sunday group  Marc Thiessen of the American Enterprise Institute Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner and Mo Elleithee of Georgetown Universitys Institutes of Politics and Public Service  Marc the latest polls and there are a number of them show that  that President Trump is trailing Joe Biden badly and that Bidens lead is growing  Lets take a look at some of the numbers  Nationally Fox News has Biden up by 12 points The New York Times has him leading by 14  And then theres Florida which is I think wed all agree a must win for the president Fox News has Biden up by 9 The Times has Biden leading by 6  Marc we all know a lot can change in four plus months between now and the election but why do you think  I mean youre  you  you laugh at  the president is trailing and in fact Bidens lead is growing Why  MARC THIESSEN RESIDENT FELLOW THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE It is Its not good Its not good for the president And sometimes the president is his only worst enemy in fueling  fueling these polls But I  before my friend Mo and some  and my Democratic friends get too excited about these numbers three reasons to  the  why the president might be in better shape than we think  First  first of all as you said Chris four months to go And if you think about whats happened over the last four months we had the worst pandemic since 1918 the worst economic devastation since 1930 in the worst social unrest since the 1960s all in four months Four months is an eternity  Second of all Joe Bidens going to have to come out of his basement at some point As youve pointed out he  he hasnt had a press conference in 87 days Hes going to have to debate Donald Trump Donald Trump is going to be campaigning not against a guy in his basement but a real live person who is prone to making a lot of gaffes on the  on the stage  WALLACE Right  THIESSEN So hes going to have a reallive candidate  But most importantly Chris the economy is coming back a lot faster than anyone expected We were supposed to have 8 million job losses in May Instead we got 25 million jobs created Economists predict that were going to have the same kind of job creation for the next four months  WALLACE OK  THIESSEN We could have 20 percent to 30 percent growth And so Trump is going to be campaigning on a growing economy and hes going to ask voters are you  do you want to  do you want to keep this going or do you want to risk it all And thats going to be a  a  a  a real question that people are going to have to grapple with  WALLACE So Mo Im going to just turn it to you how do you react to these polls and how do you react to Marcs theory of  of how this whole race could  could flip in the next four months  MO ELLEITHEE GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE Well Marc and I have agreed before and I suspect well agree again today As he said there are four months to go Anything could happen Democrats should not rest on these polls Theres a lot of intangibles as weve seen over the past few months  Having said that you know I think there are a lot of Republicans out there that which the president would actually go into a basement and stop going out there because every time he goes out there he makes it worse  Look just look at the  just look at 2020 alone There was all the controversy surrounding impeachment There was the pandemic There was all the racial unrest and protests in the streets after the  the death of George Floyd Theres an economy that is struggling as a result of that And now you  you  you keep seeing additional controversies swirling Just this weekend the story about Russians putting a bounty on US and British soldiers in the White House knowing and not doing anything about it All of these things swirling together are creating a sense of chaos  WALLACE Let me  let me just interrupt quickly to say that what  the president says  let me just interrupt to say the president says that he was not briefed on that  ELLEITHEE Right But the White House   WALLACE The Russia   ELLEITHEE Has not denied that someone in the White House has known about it But  but the bigger point here of all of these things swirling around together and creating a sense of chaos is exhausting to people And when the presidents behavior which is erratic it is all over the place it is unsteady most importantly he is not projecting a sense of bringing people together and that hes got a steady hand at the wheel All of that is not going to help him in his case to turn these poll numbers around  WALLACE All right  Meanwhile and one of the things I think well all agree is that Biden is not making many public appearances but in one of them relatively rare this week the former vice president said this  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  JOE BIDEN D PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE Hes like a child who cant believe this has happened to him All his whining and selfpity Well this pandemic didnt happen to him it happened to all of us  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Gillian is Biden hurting the president or is the president doing most of the damage to himself right now And  and how  how it  how possible is it for him to turn it around  GILLIAN TURNER FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Well we know that the Democratic strategy the DNC strategy even Bidens campaign strategy up till now has really been to play it on defense Thats why weve seen him quoteunquote staying in the basement thats why weve seen them doing far fewer events than he would during a normal campaign season Its because so far he can afford to do that His poll numbers are great theyre improving but it doesnt mean that thats going to hold  Kevin McCarthy House minority leader put it really well to Fox News a couple of days ago He said that if the election the general election was scheduled for this coming week Republicans would be very worried President Trump would be very worried But that as both Moe and Marc point out in the next four months this thing could literally flipflop back and forth another 100 times When were looking at campaign time the campaign election cycle theyre operating in an entirely different universe Four months is an eternity Its kind of like dog time So really four months out its pretty useless to start hypothesizing about where this is going to be four months from now The best thing we can hope to do is start sussing ph out a trend line  WALLACE Right  Marc I want to bring up one last subject because I have to say this really surprised me  Late Thursday night around midnight the Trump Justice Department filed a brief joining a number of state attorneys general in calling for the Supreme Court to overturn to end Obamacare which they wouldnt even take up until next October and wouldnt be decided before the election So its not like its going to happen  Meanwhile right now because of the pandemic and people losing jobs and losing their health insurance a half million more people since March have signed up for Obamacare  Does it make political sense  I  I understand why the president and Republicans dont like Obamacare but does it make political sense at this point to double down on killing Obamacare  THIESSEN No it doesnt Trying to repeal Obamacare during a pandemic is not smart But I do think that  I mean part of the reason why they filed that brief I dont think it was their own timing  choice of timing The  this case is coming up in the fall and there are  there are deadlines for filing certain briefs and getting things before the court So I  you know this was a  this is a timed process that is driven by the attorney generals lawsuit which was filed in 2018 is now coming to fruition this fall so they had to get the filing in But no its not good timing at all for the president  WALLACE Right  THIESSEN And the Democrats are going to demagogue it  WALLACE Well let  let me bring it up quickly and I got a minute Mo Health care was I think wed all agree the best issue for Democrats in 2018 And the president seemed to recognize that because he put out a tweet on Friday after the  the blowback to the decision to  to try to end Obamacare Rather on Saturday He sent this tweet out I will always protect people with preexisting conditions always always always  How effective is that in getting the president and Republicans off the hook on Obamacare  ELLEITHEE Yes I dont think there are a lot of people out there that are going to look at that  that tweet and say whoo OK good my  my concerns are gone now  Look hes  he hasnt learned anything from the past couple of election cycles which is Obamacares becoming more and more popular and Republicans have been talking about this for the past decade about repealing Obamacare and still have not coalesced around an alternative As you said Chris were in the middle of a pandemic To to go out there railing against Obamacare four months before an election the middle of a pandemic with no alternative thats political malfeasance  TURNER Also coming on the heels Chris   WALLACE All right panel we have to take   TURNER Of two recent big decisions that kill the  that have been hurtful to the presidents agenda  WALLACE All right we have to take a break here but when we come back new developments in the case against retired General Michael Flynn and new controversy over William Barrs performance as attorney general  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES And Im very happy about General Flynn He was treated horribly He as treated very very horribly by a group of very bad people  GEN MICHAEL FLYNN RET FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER Its a good thing for me Its a good thing for my family But its really a great  a boost of confidence for the American people in our justice system  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Reaction this week from former  or from President Trump and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to a ruling by the court of appeals that the case against Flynn should be dropped  And were back now with our panel  Gillian the question now is whether the full court of appeals will decide to hear this case as to whether or not the  the Justice Department decision to drop the case should be honored And the other question is whether or not the judge whos actually handled the case federal judge Emmett Sullivan what he will do  What are you hearing  TURNER Well Judge Sullivan took the first step this week that many legal experts say is really the first step in dismissing the case as he has now been ordered to do He suspended the next upcoming hearing which was slated for July 16th So if we go with what the legal experts are saying it looks like its headed in that direction of formally dropping the case dropping all criminal charges against Flynn  A quick note on Flynn himself Chris President Trump says that Flynn has been treated unfairly by the media and by Democrats and by the intelligence community The reality here is that General Flynn mistreated President Trump his campaign and his administration during its very early very sensitive days as it was trying to find its way in the White House and set up a brandnew administration when he lied for the vice president as both President Trump himself has admitted   WALLACE Right  TURNER As Vice President Mike Prince has  has also admitted So its not just about mistreatment going one way here  WALLACE Then theres the case of Roger Stone another confidant former advisor to President Trump where the Justice Department decided to seek a lighter sentence than the prosecutors in the case that got him convicted were seeking The  one of the former prosecutors in that case testified before Congress this week  Here he is  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  AARON ZELINSKY ASSISTANT US ATTORNEY The Department of Justice treated Roger Stone differently from everyone else And I was told that the department cut Roger Stone a break because of his relationship to the president  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Marc what do you think of how the Justice Department has handled both the Flynn and the Roger Stone cases  THIESSEN So everyone is accusing Bill Barr of politicizing the Justice Department In fact what he is doing is the opposite he is depoliticizing the Justice Department because the Justice Department was politicized to begin with when he inherited it As we saw from the Flynn case as we saw from the Mueller probe which we spent two years and 30 million chasing a conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia none of it was true  The Flynn interview should never have happened because the FBI had already concluded that Flynn had not conspired with Russia had cleared him for an absence of derogatory information So why would they interview him about his conversation with Russian Ambassador Kislyak which we now know from Peter Strzoks notes which were just revealed this week that  that FBI Director Comey told President Obama that conversation was completely legit There was no Russia collusion conspiracy There was no Logan Act violation and no ones ever been prosecuted for the Logan Act yet they went ahead with it anyway  This is the sign that there is a  that there is a Justice Department that has been deeply corrupted over the previous eight years politicized and Attorney General Barr is trying to get rid of that politicization  WALLACE Mo I want to bring you in And I think Marc framed it pretty darn well better than I was going to is Bill Barr putting the politics into the Justice Department or taking it out  ELLEITHEE I dont think either of you will be surprised that  that I lean the other way on this one  Look I think this is on attorney general this is a Justice Department that has shown time and time again its willingness to give preferential treatment to the president This is a president who promised he was going to drain the swamp This was a president who promised that he was going to restore a sense of fairness in our  in our justice system to  for those who felt that there wasnt it but he has shown time and time again that hes just making it swampier  And its  and it surprises me that Bill Barr would play along with this because based on his last tenure that wasnt who he was But since taking the  assuming the role this time he seems much more open much more willing to  to  to play along with the presidents political agenda and using the  the Justice Department to further it I think there are a lot of people out there that are going to be looking at this administration headed into the final months before this election and say he promised to drain the swamp so why is it that the presidents allies and the presidents friends are the ones who are getting all the breaks  WALLACE Gillian I want to go back to a point that  that Marc made about these  these handwritten notes in the Flynn case because this week when the court of appeals rules that the case had to be dropped and weve got them up here on the screen some handwritten notes from of all people former FBI Agent Peter Strzok were released You can see the scroll on the right and weve tried to make  decipher them on the left that show then President Obama and Vice President Biden weighing in just before they left office in January of 2017 So this is after President Trump has been elected And it appears that Biden is suggesting that Flynn may have violated the Logan Act what a 200yearold acts that has never been prosecuted  Now Gillian we should point out that the Biden campaign denies that Biden never said that and Strzok was not actually in the meeting so he was taking notes from somebodys account of the meeting  Having said that the notes are kind of curious  TURNER They are And I think that it is incumbent upon a whole lot of people now in the justice system to take a look at the broader context of those notes so that we understand exactly what they mean and why those officials who allegedly said those things said them whether the campaign refutes it or not  I think  when I look at this and I look at the facts of this case Chris Im not looking at it through the lens of this political war the broader political war thats being fought on Flynns behalf Republicans versus Democrats Its been well established I think that the FBI did overreach when it came to investigating Flynn during the beginning of this But that said I look at this through the lens of somebody who used to do government policy for a living a former public servant And when it comes to public service I believe that General Flynn really failed the Trump administration He did not hold with upstand  excuse me uphold the highest level of ethics thats demanded of somebody whos the national security advisor of the United States There was never a context or an environment in which its OK to lie to the FBI or to lie to the vice president whether they interview with the FBI and Flynn should have ever happened or not as Marc said is one thing but he certainly did not have the prerogative to lie to them when it did happen  WALLACE All right were going to have to leave it there panel  It is interesting though because Vice President Bidens story about what he knew about the prosecution of Flynn has changed First he said that he didnt know anything Then he said yes he was in the meeting Then youve got this note in which supposedly he brings a prosecution under the Logan Act He says he didnt say that To be continued as this campaign goes on  Thank you panel See you next Sunday  Up next our Power Player of the Week Well talk to the man now

seeks to gain control of the crisis The barbs have come from the campaign trail from governors mansions and mayors offices — and few have teed up warnings as dire as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio who on Sunday   people will die if Trump doesnt give the city further help The president of the United States is from New York City and he will not lift a finger to help his hometown” de Blasio said on NBCs Meet the Press Sunday I don’t get it He continued If the president doesn’t act people will die who could have lived otherwise For their part Democrats are facing heavy criticism from GOP colleagues after blocking the aid bill overnight Sen Susan Collins RMaine said the move by Democrats is irresponsible and unwise They are playing with fire she said  Mayor de Blasio asked Trump to bring in the military to fight the coronavirus in hotspots like New York City which is where about onethird of the coronavirus cases in the US currently are I guarantee you theyre ready to serve but the president has to give the order the mayor said blaming Trump for keeping the militarys logistical resource on the sidelines Illinois Governor JB   also slammed Trump Sunday saying Trumps apparent decision to call the coronavirus the Chinese virus is profoundly unAmerican People from every demographic every race ethnicity gender or background have been infected Suggesting otherwise or engaging in racist speech or acts is one of the most profoundly unAmerican things that I can think of Pritzker said of Trump The current crisis should drive home to all of us just how connected we all are We can choose how we want to come out on the other side of this — lets choose to be one Illinois Trump has repeatedly stood by his Chinese virus terminology and others in his administration have also called the coronavirus variations of the Wuhan virus and the Chinese coronavirus in an apparent effort to counteract a Chinese propaganda campaign trying to shift responsibility for the pandemic to the United States The coronavirus originated in Wuhan China and its spread was exacerbated by early mishandling and lack of transparency by the Chinese government Pritzker also targeted Trump online after the president picked him out by name as a member of a very small group of certain other Governors who shouldn’t be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings Pritzker shot back You wasted precious months when you couldve taken action to protect Americans  Illinoisans You should be leading a national response instead of throwing tantrums from the back seat Where were the tests when we needed them Wheres the PPE Get off Twitter  do your job Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also stepped into the fray accusing Trump of yammering about hoaxes and fake news Michigan Gov Gretchen Whitmer in an interview with Fox News Sunday also panned Trumps coronavirus response when asked about a tweet from earlier last week when Trump called her the Failing Michigan Governor and said she needed to be more proactive He’s responding to my criticism that they didn’t do the preparation that they needed to do on the front end she said That’s why we have a shortage of tests That’s why we have people who don’t take this seriously — because for a long time we were told that it wasn’t to be taken seriously This is what were up against And from the campaign trail Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden who is likely to face Trump in the November general election launched repeated attacks not only on the administrations immediate handling of the coronavirus threat but also on the bill being supported by Trump and Senate Republicans as a thirdphase coronavirus response Mr President stop lying and start acting Biden said in a statement specifically mentioning Trumps reluctance to use the Defense Production Act to mobilize the private sector to build the equipment hospitals and doctors will need to battle the coronavirus Use the full extent of your authorities now to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go Trump invoked the Defense Production Act last week but initially said he didnt plan to use it citing voluntary work by the private sector to meet medical professionals needs He later during a phone conversation with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave the order to his staff to begin using his powers under the act though it is not clear what exactly he is ordering produced to fight the pandemic Biden then launched a broadside against Trump and the Senate GOP as their bill failed to clear a vote on a procedural hurdle Sunday night after being blocked by Democrats Here’s what’s happening The White House and the Senate Republicans have proposed a 500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary would decide which big businesses get how much and he can give out billions with virtually no strings attached Biden said The Trump Administration could even allow companies to use taxpayers’ money for stock buybacks and executive pay packages and they don’t have to tell Americans where the money is going for months he continued Bidens rhetoric echoes that from Senate Democrats and Schumer on the problems in the Senate coronavirus bill despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells pleas for lawmakers to hold their noses and vote for it for the sake of Americans confidence in their lawmakers and for the stock market — futures fell significantly Sunday night after the procedural vote on the bill failed Criticism from Trump on the coronavirus has also come from the likes of Colorado Gov Jared Polis a Democrat who said on   Sunday Im not a socialist like Donald Trump in response to Republicans efforts to prop up companies hit hard by the coronavirusinduced economic slowdown potentially taking an equity stake in companies it gives money to I think that rather than these corporate bailouts we should be talking about helping people Polis said That means workers that means small business owners that means everybody Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly said what the administration wants are not bailouts citing the apparently temporary nature of the current economic downturn and saying that the economy and these companies just need some temporary liquidity until the spread of the coronavirus is medically under control Sen Kamala Harris DCalif also took shots at Trump Sunday both for the   to spend hundreds of billions of dollars helping corporations with liquidity and for moving forward with its effort to strike down the Affordable Care Act  also known as Obamacare  in the courts Outrageous Harris said in a tweet We are in the middle of a global pandemic and Donald Trump wants to strip health care from millions of Americans This is why we fight All of this criticism comes after a couple of weeks of relative unity as politicians worked to fight the coronavirus Trump last week even earned praise from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Rep Ilhan Omar DMinn over his coronavirus response But it appears the honeymoon is over With the Senate likely to vote again on its coronavirus

federal government seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Lehman Brothers tanked Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch The Fed took over AIG Questions lingered about overall liquidity Pelosi wanted an update having not heard from the Treasury Secretary for several days Pelosi later said the reason Paulson hadn’t briefed Congressional leaders “was because they did not want us to know” how bad things were as the global economy clutched the ledge by its fingernails When Pelosi reached Paulson in the midafternoon she suggested they meet the next morning But that wouldn’t work for Paulson “Madam Speaker tomorrow morning will be too late” Paulson told the Speaker “Then why am I calling you” asked an incredulous Pelosi The Speaker later recounted that Paulson impressed upon her that if they didn’t huddle that evening “we wouldn’t have an economy by Monday” By nightfall Paulson Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Chris Cox   for a rare evening meeting with the Speaker Other top bipartisan Congressional leaders and almost two dozen committee and subcommittee chairs along with ranking minority members crammed into the Speaker’s conference room Paulson told the assembly he needed several hundred billion dollars “urgently” to stave off a financial collapse not seen since 1929 Bernanke told lawmakers that GM could tank The market could crater by 30 percent Unemployment could skyrocket Lawmakers are loquacious They can barely contain the logorrhea when things are going well But after 90 minutes of the worst possible news since 911 the lawmakers emptied out unwilling to say much of anything You could tell the members were processing things Digesting things Wrapping their heads around the consequences of what Messrs Paulson Bernanke and Cox told them behind closed doors But there was fear The facial complexions of lawmakers weren’t flushed Their voices didn’t crack They didn’t tremble when they ambled back to the House and Senate wings of the Capitol pursued by a throng of reporters through the Rotunda They simply spoke in hushed voices They stared at their shoes as they walked across the marble floors And when they did look up you saw it Right in their eyes Fear The lawmakers didn’t know if Paulson’s plan would work They didn’t know how they would even pass it The measure ultimately failed once in the House gutting 777 points off the Dow – then the biggest singleday point drop in history Lawmakers didn’t know what to do And that’s why they were afraid They couldn’t control the financial meltdown They couldn’t control the markets They couldn’t control unemployment Politicians are used to being in control And that’s why when they glanced up from their shoelaces there was fear We’ve not detected fear per se on Capitol Hill amid the coronavirus outbreak But lawmakers know coronavirus isn’t something they can fully control They can only respond – and hope they respond in the best way possible with money and resources On Monday night Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby RAL in charge of deciding what money the government should spend to combat coronavirus spoke in stark terms “Staring the administration and all of us in the face is a possible pandemic” said Shelby “Something we haven’t seen in my lifetime” Shelby is now 85yearsold “This is no ordinary crisis coming up” observed Shelby “I would call this a dire emergency” At the time Shelby said it was hard to estimate how much money was needed to fight coronavirus But the Alabama Republican was clear it was best to get the dollar figure right the first time After all it’s easier to pass one big bill than two or three Even if the grand total turns out to be less The administration sent a formal spending request to Capitol Hill later that night 25 billion for coronavirus Only 12 billion was new money “If you lowball something like this you’ll pay for it later” said Shelby “More funding is normally what people will say solves all the problems I don’t think it does” said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe ROK about the fiscal response to coronavirus “It needs a lot of attention But not necessarily more funding” Shelby didn’t offer a specific dollar figure But by Tuesday morning one administration source derided the Appropriations Committee Chairman as a “big spender” On Wednesday morning Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer DNY floated a proposal totaling 85 billion for coronavirus By Wednesday afternoon House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCA called the administration plan “a little low” He suggested around 4 billion On Wednesday night President Trump conceded he was game to spend more on coronavirus “If they want to give us more money that’s ok We’ll take more money Some Republicans think we should have more money” said Mr Trump Come Thursday afternoon Fox was told lawmakers were developing a package of around 7 billion for coronavirus Keep in mind that Paulson told lawmakers on that fateful night in September 2008 he required hundreds of billions of dollars They settled on a 700 billion tourniquet to stem the bleeding and rescue

scientistphysicians But they had white coats on because that would reassure” said Shalala “The last thing you want is the President of the United States talking about science” Both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKY and McCarthy criticized Democrats for what they considered a politicization of coronavirus “The coronavirus does not care about partisan bickering or political news cycles This new disease is not going to press pause so that members can engage in performative outrages that gets us farther from results rather than closer” said McConnell “Diseases don’t know party lines” said McCarthy “But Democrats can’t help put politics over country” When asked if it was President Trump who politicized coronavirus by declaring that Pelosi was “incompetent”  and describing Schumer as “Cryin’ Chuck” as his Wednesday night press conference McCarthy replied “I don’t believe so” Capitol Hill is awash in concern about coronavirus But there’s not fear – yet “It’s going to disappear” said the President Thursday night “One day it’s like a miracle It will disappear” But what if the carnage continues on Wall Street or if there’s a spike in infections In 2008 Hank Paulson delivered sobering news to lawmakers He told them matteroffactly what would happen if Congress didn’t take action That’s when fear set in Today we don’t know how bad coronavirus could be But if someone of authority delivers bad news like Paulson did 12 years ago brace yourselves"},

{"5781": "NEIL CAVUTO ANCHOR Well if Wall Street is worried about the president acting on his own to try to get some coronavirus stimulus in the economy it had a funny way of showing it The Dow is getting closer and closer to record territory about 5 percent away today thanks to a huge advance buoyed by economically sensitive kind of companies that could use the boost and use the good word And the worstcase scenario is the president doesnt get his way but it compels Democrats and Republicans to put together something that will even go further than his way Talk about a confluence of great events for the markets Welcome everybody Im Neil Cavuto and this is Your World And what in the world making fastmoving developments on this stimulus front all but given up for dead and the presidents prescriptions all but considered dead on arrival until you consider the implications of what he wants to do cut the payroll tax for most Americans also extend jobless benefits right through the end of the year The devil is in the details and whether he can do a lot of what he wants to do but right now the momentum seems to be following the president because some Democrats are already buckling They say they want to return to the table and the sooner the better Would this have even been possible had the president not made the moves he did First to John Roberts right now at the White House with more  John JOHN ROBERTS FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Neil good afternoon to you The presidents strategy going into this was like this If the Democrats refuse to do a deal with the White House the president would take unilateral action that might be legally dubious would certainly leave probably invite some sort of a court challenge and then the White House would have the opportunity to say wait a second here Were providing unemployment insurance for people who really need it maybe not at the level we were before but 400 extra a week Thats not too shabby And youre going to stand in the way of is doing that Now certainly the power of the purse rests with the House of Representatives Theres no question about that But the president does have some latitude to move money around that has already been appropriated For the extra unemployment insurance the president wants to tap FEMAs disaster relief fund which has got about 44 billion in it to pay for 75 percent of a 400aweek plusup in unemployment States would have to pick up the other 25 percent 100 though in some cases the president said yesterday the federal government could pick up the whole tab Listen here BEGIN VIDEO CLIP PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP We have a system where we can do 100 percent or we can do 75 percent Theyd pay 25 And itll depend on the state And they will make an application We will look at it and we will make a decision So it may be they will pay nothing in some instances It may be a little bit like the National Guard END VIDEO CLIP ROBERTS Now the president has got too many goals in this strategy first to claim the political high ground on this issue and as you mentioned at the top Neil force Democrats back to the table to make a deal that they have so far been unwilling to make The president tweeting this morning  quote  So now Schumer and Pelosi want to meet to make a deal Amazing how it all works isnt it Where have they been for the last four weeks when they were hardliners and only wanted bailout money for Democratrun states and cities that are failing badly They know my phone number Its interesting also Neil to note the political posturing here Democrats are criticizing the president for doing the same thing that they used to praise President Obama for doing That was using executive action to do an endrun around a recalcitrant Congress At the same time though Republicans are praising President Trump for almost the very same thing they soundly criticized President Obama for doing  Neil CAVUTO Whatever works and whatever period ROBERTS Yes CAVUTO All right thank you John Roberts very very much By the way there are a number are CEOs who are very leery of following through on the presidents wishes here because they dont want to be left hanging out to dry here surrendering this money giving it back to workers when in fact it could prove only temporary and they have to collect it all over again So they dont want to be out on that Were going to be exploring that a little bit later In the meantime I do want to get the latest on Capitol Hill from Chad Pergram He has put  that is Chad the president has put Democrats on the defense here So what is the likelihood of them coming up with something more to their liking What are you hearing CHAD PERGRAM FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT Well theres a chance that this could kind of prompt these talks The idea of the president taking executive action was always interpreted to be a negotiating point by the White House here And after two weeks of talks that basically went nowhere the White House indicated that it had no other choice than to take executive action Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KAYLEIGH MCENANY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY This president instructed his administration to find every single way possible that without congressional Democrats who have been unrelenting and lacking in any sort of care or empathy for the American people at least when it comes to their negotiating tactics if theyre not going to act and care for the American people he would END VIDEO CLIP PERGRAM Congressional Democratic leaders and Trump administration officials met almost daily for two weeks virtually no progress there The Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for not helping those out of work BEGIN VIDEO CLIP SEN MITCH MCCONNELL RKY Over the weekend President Trump cooked stuff to soften the blow of the Democrats hostage tactics on American families who need help most END VIDEO CLIP PERGRAM Now as John said Republicans used to rail against President Obama for his executive orders in particular when the president bypassed Congress with DACA But now Democrats are smarting after Mr Trump circumvented Congress this weekend BEGIN VIDEO CLIP SEN CHARLES SCHUMER DNY The reason we want to meet in the middle is that getting major legislation through Congress is the only way to achieve something significant for the American people Rather than compromise our Republican counterparts said take a hike END VIDEO CLIP PERGRAM Now on the Senate floor just a couple of moments ago Chuck Schumer was very critical of what the president did over the weekend He called these executive orders a  quote  disaster And as it pertains to the eviction moratorium he said that that was  quote  all sizzle and no steak  Neil CAVUTO All right thank you Chad very much Im really really quickly curious though Chad what is your sense about whether the two sides will meet Could it be within the next couple of days because times a wasting right PERGRAM Time is a wasting And it might not be a situation where they get a bill this month or maybe September but there will be another bill Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell here hes trying a tactic by holding the Senate in session this week Now thats a little bit of a misnomer there because only a skeleton crew is on hand The House of Representatives is not here Hes trying to contrast the idea that the Senate is here and the House is not the House is not going to be back until midSeptember and try to apply pressure right there But the longer this goes on that probably increases the chances the sides come back to the bargaining table CAVUTO Chad Pergram thank you very much I want to go to Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson on all of this Senator good to have you back I know you join us on the phone sir but your sense of whether the president can do this Your colleague Ben Sasse of Nebraska says technically he cant He is worried about that But where are you on this SEN RON JOHNSON RWIS Well first of all I think the way the president and his legal team have crafted this was pretty narrow in scope And so my guess is they probably have the authority under disaster relief Its one of the reasons why for example on the support for people on unemployment where were plussing it up by 400 asking the states to do 100 thats pretty well dictated by the FEMA Disaster Relief Act where states have to contribute 25 percent So I think they really are taking the authority And lets face it Congress has  past Congresses have given presidents all kinds of different authority to act on their own And my guess is that  and I havent looked at the exact legal description of this but my guess is the legal team has done a pretty good job of looking at exactly what legal authority he has Hes using it to the extent that he can But thats part of the problem is that hes restrained or constrained in terms of what he all can do CAVUTO You know Republicans were dead set against Barack Obama doing these sort of things for example two different payroll tax cut packages in 2010 again in 2012 Democrats were overwhelmingly for it Now its completely flipped So is this all just politics here JOHNSON Well I think this is quite different What we all did is in a pretty much unanimous basis realize back in March and April that we had to act quickly we had to act massively We knew what we were going to pass was going to be far from perfect But we passed 29 trillion by some reports well over 3 trillion And to just put that into perspective Neil thats 135 percent of our economy Thats how much that is Employment now is down by 8 percent Unemployment is you know 105 percent but employment is down 8 percent Recent economic forecasts are that our GDP will probably shrink by 46 to 8 percent So we have already passed 135 percent We havent spent or even obligated about 12 trillion of what we have already done So when Nancy Pelosi came out of the box less than a month later in mid May and passed another 3 trillion package that signaled to me that they were just going to play politics that they really werent interested in a deal Thats a massive amount of spending that the Democrats want And were actually concerned about the debt Were 265 trillion in debt on our way to 27 trillion 28 trillion We dont have an unlimited checking account So I think Republicans are trying to be responsible I certainly am And the president at the same time he wants to protect those individuals that have to have CROSSTALK CAVUTO No I get that Senator But its not as if people are really  but its not as people seem to be worried about the deficit Even Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says thats not a concern right now You have signed on the party has signed on Democrats have signed on to trillions of stimulus and again to your point sir maybe because its necessary and this is not the time to quibble over a lot of this stuff For example in the payroll tax cut that the president is proposing do you think it should be temporary A lot of businesses if that is the case know that theyre going to have to pay that money back and might not dole it out JOHNSON Well again I have been suggesting what we ought to do is  is spend what we have already authorized not authorize more spending and quite honestly target it to those people that actually need it So I understand where the president is coming in terms of payroll tax cut But those people are working I would much rather direct financial aid to people that arent working which is why I went on the floor of the Senate two weeks ago and offered a unanimous consent resolution to plus up state unemployment benefits by 200 a week By the way that is eight times what the Democrats passed back in 2009 after the Great Recession They plussed up state unemployment benefits by 25 That was OK for Democrats back then Now 200 is not enough They insist on 600 which you realize is a huge disincentive for people to reengage in the work force So listen there are a lot of disagreements on all sides But the hypocrites here are really Democrats who want to pile on another 3 trillion after we have already authorized over 3 trillion and havent spent over a trillion This is not Monopoly money So at some point the bill is going to come due on this We dont have an unlimited checking account And from my standpoint I dont want to authorize another penny until we have actually spent redirected repurposed what we have already authorized that hasnt been spent CAVUTO All right we will watch it closely Senator because to your point with the minimum trilliondollar cost with this package were well over 105 trillion right now some say closer to 12 trillion in various virusrelated relief efforts between what you guys have been doing both parties and what obviously the Federal Reserve has been doing So we will watch it very closely Senator Thank you very very much Senator Ron Johnson In the meantime were following developments that are a little bit more pressing to residents in cities like Chicago and in Seattle and in New York and particularly in Chicago where the violence is getting so out of control that you have people getting injured and some police officers included saying enough COMMERCIAL BREAK CAVUTO It doesnt stop After an uproarious weekend of violence in the Windy City still more troubles today if you can believe it Garrett Tenney in Chicago with the latest Hey Garrett whats going on GARRETT TENNEY FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Well Neil as we have been reporting there is looting going on right now Chicago police tell us this is happening in the citys West Side neighborhoods And this is about seven miles from the Magnificent Mile where we are downtown You can see some aerial video of whats going on there right now Were told that at least one sheriffs deputy has been taken to the hospital after he was hit in the face by a brick that was thrown through the window of his car Now as for what we saw last night as that scene unfolds police say that officerinvolved shooting Sunday afternoon on the South Side is what prompted these riots overnight Hundreds of people came downtown in a caravan of cars and essentially went from block to block jumping out of the car breaking into a store grabbing whatever they could carry and then moving on before police could catch them Dozens of businesses were hit Most of them were highend stores in this typically very safe neighborhood But last night you could hear gunshots throughout the early hours of the morning as police tried to get the situation under control Today folks who live here are a bit shaken Most we have spoken to are angry and blame city officials for allowing this to happen But several said while theyre disappointed these riots happened theyre not surprised BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JORDAN MOOSE CHICAGO RESIDENT Its frustrating because it already happened and all this kind of conflict we thought was getting resolved is obviously not there We need more security I think we just need more help And some people dont want the help ASHLEE HARDGRAVES CHICAGO RESIDENT Its hard You see a neighborhood like this with affluence and its understandably targeted And its hard when youre an ally and supportive of so many different communities to see it happen But you just want to help where you can END VIDEO CLIP TENNEY At least 13 officers were injured More than 100 people were arrested And today city officials were calling on prosecutors not to let anyone off the hook and hold everyone accountable who was involved in these riots They said that was not the case following the riots several months ago when hundreds of people were never prosecuted  Neil CAVUTO All right thank you my friend very much Be safe there Chief James Craig of the Detroit Police Department the police chief there with me now Chief we always gather when theres been something like this going on You have been able to try to police no pun intended what is going on in your city to maintain control But whats happening in Chicago seems to be a very different matter What do you think they should do JAMES CRAIG DETROIT MICHIGAN POLICE CHIEF You know it is a very different matter Neil And certainly Im not going to criticize my partner out there the new superintendent who he said the right things Hes trying to do the right things But one of the things that we saw here in Detroit almost eerily similar to what happened last night in Chicago a false narrative was perpetrated by these criminals very quickly that indicated that a unarmed teen was shot and then call for people to come downtown and loot The one similarity is that the criminals tried to do the same thing here in Detroit about three weeks ago when our officers were fired upon and we ended up using deadly force They put out a false narrative that we shot an unarmed AfricanAmerican man seated on his porch Totally false What was different a couple of things Neil One we got out in front very quickly As you know we had a video out that refuted what these criminals were trying to perpetrate And that helped us a great deal but also the fact that we have a community here in Detroit that trusts this police department trusts the leadership And so we have built that capital up I think whats going on in Chicago right now is I think theyre still reeling from the 2014 shooting Laquan McDonald It took a year Neil one year And they were forced to release that video where this 17yearold was shot 16 times And so I got to believe those wounds are still open So they still have a long way to go to build that trust in the community But that certainly doesnt negate these what I call domestic terrorists that come in and agitate violence in our city So we have been very fortunate here CAVUTO Yes And to your point Chief a lot of them come from out of town Theyre not even residents here So they come in to incite this and act on innuendo and charges that you say can sometimes be disproven as they were in Detroit I remember that particular case you were dealing with CRAIG Yes CAVUTO But thank God to clarify it as quickly as you were And you had video to support what you were saying Right now theyre protesting first and asking questions later And all of this is fueling as you and I have discussed many times these defunding efforts going on in one city after another of police departments Does it worry about what happens there eventually will impact you in Detroit CRAIG Well we stood alone Neil Again when I looked at some of the cities around the country including my old home of Los Angeles Philadelphia certainly Chicago the same thing could have happened here But because of our relationship with the community that really worked well in how we respond to the fact that these outsiders couldnt come in here and really agitate and fuel violence And trust me Neil they made several attempts They still make attempts to do it And they just cant get great traction here in Detroit And by and large its because of that relationship And again you cant wait for the bad thing to happen Neil Police departments must continue to build on that capital of trust with your community Its got to be part of your mission It just has to happen But the community has to believe in CAVUTO Its also got to be part of the DNA Its in your DNA Chief because its a 247 concern of yours You never let go But thats not happening in every city Chief we will watch it closely Thank you I apologize again under these circumstances we have to talk but I think America needs to hear from you about this and how to avoid the spreading of this Chief be well be safe CRAIG Right Thank you Neil I appreciate you CAVUTO Same here All right theres a lot more coming up Kids are getting ready to return to school but in the middle of that reports that kids can contract the virus in apparently much bigger numbers than we thought and can spread it in much bigger numbers than we thought So what do you think thats going to do for the approaching school season Were on it COMMERCIAL BREAK CAVUTO Were about an hour away The president plans to address the nation in a press conference of sorts at the White House He will likely respond to Democrats saying they want to get back to the negotiating table maybe because hes having all the fun  after this COMMERCIAL BREAK CAVUTO Never mind the five million US coronavirus cases right now Whats raising eyebrows reports of 100000 children who have been testing positive for COVID19 in the last two weeks of July Thats up 40 percent We should point out its really moving up in states like California Arizona and guess where Florida where theyre already getting kids back in school but that could prove a Herculean leap right now given these developments But school systems are making every effort right now to make it as easy and convenient and well at least riskfree as they possibly can Bryan Llenas with more on that  Bryan BRYAN LLENAS FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Neil good afternoon Today four counties opened up their schools in Florida three of them virtually including the largest county in Central Florida Orange County and one of them inperson Baker County which is one of the smaller ones The reality is is that counties across the state and the country are going to try to figure out how to deal with this because this isnt going anywhere And here in Cooper City were at the Renaissance Charter School Theyre using this new technology This is called the Owl It has a 360 degree camera on top and audiblesensitive cameras all around that capture a teacher as they just freely walk around the classroom Now students back at home can watch the instruction the camera and feel as though they are in the classroom Its this new immersive technology because frankly they were saying what they were seeing out there with Zooms and stuff wasnt really working They call it mobile classroom And the good thing about this they say is that its hybrid which means look coronavirus isnt going anywhere anytime soon This technology allows for teachers to instruct in the classroom as well as students virtually all at the same time BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JON HAGE CEO CHARTER SCHOOLS USA We get ahead of ourselves and we stop acting as if COVID is only about survival Its also about thriving Education right now has an real big opportunity to think outside the box And we should be using this time to do that END VIDEO CLIP LLENAS It also comes with this little headset for teachers to seamlessly answer questions from students that are in  at home And you can raise your hand like a student and as students will and students at home can see this And it just feels as though they are one And when you speak to a teacher they will tell you its a lot better than whats out there right now BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JEANNE ALONSO TEACHER CHARTER SCHOOLS USA That interaction that engagement piece thats needed to make student learning thrive was missing It was hard to engage a student when all you can see is Im stuck in front of my laptop END VIDEO CLIP LLENAS And this is the classroom here in Cooper City at Renaissance Charter Theyre usually 24 desks There are now eight And you can see that they have been socially distanced by this blue tape Now all students are also required to wear masks Broward County begins virtual learning on August 19 But charter schools they can decide what they want to do And frankly theyre going to be polling parents and figuring out how many parents are going to be wanting to send their kids And the minute that they  that number reaches a certain number theyre going to start allowing for that hybrid teaching some students here some students at home This is what they think the future is  Neil CAVUTO It is a very different world my friend Thank you very much Bryan Llenas in the middle of all that in Florida Hope springs eternal Not so for this Georgia school Remember that famous infamous shot of a school where the kids were crowded in a hallway switching classes It turns out that the school is temporarily shutting down right now after nine students and staff members had tested positive for COVID19 But my buddy Kennedy joins me right now Kennedy think about it Its almost unavoidable in those circumstances right Youre crowding kids together No matter much  whatever youre doing on distancing in the classrooms and elsewhere theyre still going to congregate in hallways and theyre still going to have to switch classes And its a nightmare in that regard you know LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT It is But thats why most of these schools are talking about being at onethird to onehalf capacity like that charter school that Bryan Llenas was just showing you CAVUTO Right Right MONTGOMERY Now they only got a third of the students in the classrooms so that means they have only got a third of the students in the hallways And also people may be disgusted by that but its actually a very good laboratory because it shows other schools what not to do And it lets other administrators know that you have to account for a bunch of kids coming out at the same time So in addition to staggering days that students are going to be in school they also have to stagger when theyre eating lunch and when theyre leaving classrooms so you dont have something like that which didnt account for CAVUTO Right MONTGOMERY And it really reminds me of Y2K because people were so worried that all the clocks and computers were going to freak out and the entire world was going to stop spinning on its axes and we were going to die And the thing thats happening here in schools we really dont know if kids are susceptible to the virus if theyre in groups together and if theyre not susceptible if they have limited symptoms if they can still spread it to some older and vulnerable family members That is the 64 million question And we just dont know the answer to that So were still anticipating So there are places like New York which starts a little later California those schools arent opening in person for at least several months They are doing all distance learning for now CAVUTO Right MONTGOMERY But they will see what happens in places like Georgia and Florida who have earlier calendars They commence earlier an earlier school year And we will see if they can in fact somehow with masks sanitizer and partitions mitigate the virus CAVUTO You have two girls And Im wondering as a mom are you anxious How are they going to be handling school this fall What  how do you judge it MONTGOMERY Im very anxious Im not going to lie I mean Im a little bit of a germaphobe And I dont feel comfortable throwing them into New York City classrooms eight hours a day five days a week And Im happy I feel like both of their schools are being very thoughtful about the process And we have had several town halls with the principals and the teachers there really outlining how theyre going to make it work And theyre really trying to adjust for siblings so they attend school on the same day CAVUTO All right MONTGOMERY But as a mom Im still scared because there are people who have gotten very sick There are people  this is a deadly virus CAVUTO Absolutely No absolutely MONTGOMERY And you dont want to be the parent with the one kid who unfortunately has the worst consequences from it But by the same measure they cannot sustain this distance learning forever They really are going to compromise their educational growth and their social growth and all the things that students need when they go to school CAVUTO All right we will watch it closely MONTGOMERY Thanks Neil CAVUTO Kennedy good catching up with you getting your read as a mom as well I think thats very very important Were going to be hearing from Senator Chris Van Hollen his views on the presidents efforts to take matters into his own hands and provide executive orders to provide stimulus Already Chuck Schumer is opening to resuming those talks What about Senator Van Hollen We will ask him next COMMERCIAL BREAK CAVUTO All right you dont do a deal I will That was the read of the president this past weekend where he ignited Democratic fury and some Republican opposition limited though it was to go ahead and act unilaterally by issuing four executive actions or orders however you want to look at it that will include shoring up monies like ongoing jobless benefits that would continue through the end of the year albeit at a smaller amount and payroll tax cuts going to those who earn 104000 or less There are other issues here but all of them Democrats say he cannot do Chris Van Hollen the Maryland Democratic senator with us right now Senator the president says hes going to do it because Democrats were not really interested in doing anything What do you say SEN CHRIS VAN HOLLEN DMD Well Neil thats just not true Democrats have been working very hard to do something to help the country As you know the House passed the HEROES Act almost three months ago We have tried to get a vote on that in the United States Senate Senator McConnell has blocked it We went to these negotiations and the administration walked away from the negotiations I dont think enough people have focused on the fact that Senator McConnell the Republican leader in the Senate has told a national audience that 20 of his Republican senators dont want to do anything zero They think the problem has gone away apparently And so that means that the administration seems unable to come to a principled centered compromise CAVUTO Well this is what he did though right He did this And now Im just asking if you are not able to come back together and work on an alternative agreement would you be against what the president wants to do these payroll tax cuts and extending jobless benefits at 400 a week rather than 600 a week with governors and states picking up 100 of that Would you be open to that or would you vote against that Would you be against doing that VAN HOLLEN Well there are  there are legal and constitutional problems which I think Republican senators have pointed out But my focus Neil is on the fact that this is actually more show than substance at the end of the day This is mostly unworkable For example the unemployment insurance what the president said to states is OK take some of the monies that we have given to you to deal with the emergencies of the pandemic a while ago as a down payment and use some of those monies to match some federal monies for UI So some of the states have already allocated most maybe in some cases all of that money We still dont know and neither does the administration Second what the president is asking those governors to do is pit one American against another right Theyre saying to governors OK the money we gave you to help with personal protective equipment or testing or to help reopen schools safely or for health care needs or all these other things take that away from those Americans in order to help the folks on UI And what Democrats are saying is we can do both We dont have to rob constituent Peter in order to help constituent Paul CAVUTO So let me get a handle on where you see this going because a lot of Democrats were all for  I dont know  at the time I think you were a congressman  but for the two occasions President Obama unilaterally cut the payroll tax Now to be fair Republicans were railing against that at the time Theyre for this Democrats were fully supportive of what President Obama was doing back then Theyre railing against this So isnt this all politics Senator VAN HOLLEN Well Neil there are a couple things here One if youre going to even consider doing that you need to at the same time fully repay and make the Social Security trust fund whole President Trump doesnt do that in this plan right He cannot do it And so what he is saying is that were going to CAVUTO Did Barack Obama Did Barack Obama VAN HOLLEN Yes absolutely every penny every penny he allocated to fill whatever holes CAVUTO So that money was paid back after the fact VAN HOLLEN A hundred percent at the same time In the same  in the same law  in the same law CAVUTO So you would be open for this Senator if  would you be open for this if he did that VAN HOLLEN No CAVUTO If this president did that VAN HOLLEN I dont think that  the payroll tax part of the presidents executive order I dont think is the most effective stimulus Neither do a great majority of Republican senators I mean you have heard that They dont think thats the most effective way to address this CAVUTO Well they were twice for Barack Obama right VAN HOLLEN No no no CAVUTO They were twice for Barack Obama VAN HOLLEN So CAVUTO They were once for George W Bush VAN HOLLEN Right Right CAVUTO So there is a precedent here right VAN HOLLEN Neil  Neil the issue right now are the 30 million Americans who are out of work And a payroll tax deduction does zero for them If youre not getting a paycheck getting some money deferred from your payroll taxes doesnt do you any good Back in the day CAVUTO Well thats where the unemployment benefits kick in right Thats where the unemployment benefits keeping them going VAN HOLLEN Yes Now  yes CAVUTO Youre right The means that might be  you have to iron out VAN HOLLEN Right CAVUTO But that is one thing you wanted to see right VAN HOLLEN So just to be clear what President Trump is proposing is simply saying that for a little while Americans who are working wont have their payroll taxes deducted But under President Trumps proposal they will have to pay every penny of it back And by the way employers are the ones who are legally liable to make sure those monies will be repaid So were hearing from lots of employers who say CAVUTO All right VAN HOLLEN  theyre not going to take the risk of whether my employee who may not even work for me anymore is going to repay those monies So its just an unworkable plan Its also not the most effective relief right now CAVUTO All right Indeed we have heard from many of those employers who are worried about just that Senator So there are a lot of issues to iron out here We will see if you guys can do that VAN HOLLEN Well CAVUTO Senator Van Hollen always a pleasure having you VAN HOLLEN Thank you Good to be with you Neil CAVUTO Thank you very very much All right in the meantime we do know the conventions are coming up next week for the Democrats And Joe Biden wont be there to address the troops so to speak And the week after that Republicans gather and the president of the United States wont be there to address the troops We already know that Joe Biden will likely give his speech at home in Delaware Were hearing that the president has narrowed it down to two locations One is the White House Thats a little tricky The other is the battlefield at Gettysburg  after this COMMERCIAL BREAK CAVUTO All right if the White House is too controversial for you the president of the United States has another option for making his acceptance speech for the Republican Partys nomination Do it at the battlefield at Gettysburg Hows that This on the heels of Joe Biden indicating he will make his acceptance speech next week not at the convention site but instead at home in Delaware Kaylee McGhee The Washington Examiner reporter extraordinaire We have also got Jessica Tarlov Democratic strategist FOX News contributor both great thinkers just slightly apart on some of these political issues LAUGHTER CAVUTO And Kaylee to you first on the president narrowing it narrowing it down to these two locations the White House or Gettysburg What do you think KAYLEE MCGHEE THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Trump is trying to make it clear that hes not scared of the coronavirus pandemic and that hes going to be willing to show up pandemic or not Now by doing so hes trying to distance himself from Biden who he has said his camping out in his basement and is unwilling to meet with voters in person even slightly so definitely markedly different strategies And Trump is really hoping that that energizes his base in a way that maybe it wont for Biden CAVUTO You know Jessica Tarlov this will be the first time since we have had these quadrennial events and conventions where both nominees are not speaking directly where the convention is being held JESSICA TARLOV FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Right CAVUTO We came close in 1860 with the Republicans and Abraham Lincoln I remember covering that one in Illinois And it almost didnt get off LAUGHTER CAVUTO But having said that it did get off It did get done And Im just wondering the impact now for the president in particular if he is robbed of a convention bounce because you  hes the one trailing in the polls That could change But hes the one who needs that bounce more Does he more in a Gettysburg or at the White House TARLOV I think he gets it more at the White House And as you said in your lead into this it could be a fraught decision It is the peoples house We pay the taxes right The House belongs to us as he works for us So that decision could be fraught to that degree But I think that with the presidents stance on defending monuments to Confederate generals like Robert E Lee that going near Gettysburg even though it was a stunning defeat for the Confederacy brings up a topic that I dont think he wants to campaign on The president wants to talk about what hes done to combat coronavirus I obviously think hes done an abysmal job at that but its going to be a lot more difficult to stay on message and away from defending General Robert E Lee if he is at Gettysburg So I think he should opt for the White  well he should opt for neither of those choices but White House over Gettysburg for sure CAVUTO All right I didnt know you thought he was doing a bad job on the virus News to me TARLOV Oh you didnt CAVUTO Im kidding TARLOV We should catch up some time CAVUTO I got to catch up on that Kaylee Im wondering where they stand I mean theres been no shortage about either of these guys being able to raise money Theres always concerns going into the fall that one partys at a disadvantage but they all raise a lot of money So I dont think thats going to be an issue How do you spend it wisely Theyre going to really beef up their advertising Right now were hearing the Biden folks are focusing on those battleground states Theyre not going to take them for granted as did Hillary Clinton What are you hearing on that front MCGHEE Well again the two strategies are very different So the Trump campaign is pouring a lot of money into inperson ground campaigning so hiring a lot of people to go door to door Last week alone they apparently knocked on more than a million doors Thats a significant number but itll take a few weeks to see if that really made a difference or not Bidens campaign on the other hand is really relying on virtual tactics so going all in on phone calls and online campaigning et cetera And we will see whether voters respond to that as well as inperson campaigning Right now it seems like Trump is really capitalizing on nailing Biden for this basement strategy And in some states it does seem to be working CAVUTO Are you worried Jessica that Joe Biden is rusty He hasnt debated in a while And hes been limiting his public appearances TARLOV He has been limiting them to some degree though hes certainly been out there a lot more than he was at the beginning of COVID19 in the United States And hes been making himself more available to the press And hopefully he will do more longform interviews Im not so worried about the debates CAVUTO All right TARLOV Hes actually pretty good at them and he really hit his stride towards the end of the primary But to the strategy about spending I think what the Biden campaign is signaling is not only can they raise as much money and if not more than President Trump in certain months but that they have a number of routes to the 270 electoral votes that they need We all assume they would be going straight for the Rust Belt but the Sunbelt looks to be in play here And to Kaylees point about President Trumps campaign thinking we will go to door to door and this will work a lot of people might not want you knocking on their door right now when our governors are telling us to mask up and to stay away from people outside of our household So it is a risky strategy healthwise CAVUTO Yes thats a very good point Ladies thank you both very very much All right I have heard of sanctioning countries I have heard of sanctioning their businesses but China now sanctioning US politicians a little more than a dozen What is it these guys did After this COMMERCIAL BREAK CAVUTO This guy next to me right now has been sanctioned by the Chinese over his Hong Kong statements Chris Smith is a New Jersey congressman Republican Joins us right now Congressman what did you do to earn that distinction REP CHRIS SMITH RNJ Well Neil a few of us have been hit by the Chinese Communist Party We warned back in 2014 that the autonomy the special status of Hong Kong was in jeopardy I introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that year It did not pass until last year And Marco Rubio did the same on the Senate side And it really provides for the ability for the president to sanction the Chinese government for its egregious behavior when it comes to human rights Theyre not keeping their word The basic law is being violated People are being rounded up and roughed up and thrown into prison And this  these are the best and the bravest and the brightest in Hong Kong particularly the young people And Xi Jinping like Mao TseTung is using force and cruelty to suppress them So we have spoken that truth to that power that dictatorship So were sanctioned CAVUTO Jimmy Lai as you know the Hong Kong billionaire and media titan SMITH Yes CAVUTO  was arrested himself today as well as his sons This is getting out of control SMITH Its totally out of control But it also is a  the harbinger of Xi Jinpings belief of expansionism hegemony for the region and for the world And thats not exaggeration at all What hes doing to Hong Kong he can do to Taiwan and to other places So we need to draw a very very big line of demarcation of what is acceptable and what is not And of course economically we have real levers of power Trump has sanctioned several top people including Carrie Lam CAVUTO All right SMITH  for her complicity in this crackdown again against these great human rights defenders CAVUTO The Hong Kong commissioner SMITH But youre right CAVUTO I wish we had more time sir Thank you very much You just got to be careful because any of you guys travel to China  and I dont know what your plans are  they can arrest you on the spot SMITH Wasnt planning on it CROSSTALK CAVUTO Its crazy So just be careful SMITH It is crazy CAVUTO Congressman thank you very very much

that’s also sickening and killing transit workers ’s subway will halt its storied overnight service starting at 1 am Wednesday to allow for additional cleaning and disinfecting of cars and stations The stoppage has some people wondering if allnight service will ever resume in the cashstrapped system Gov   pledged Tuesday that it will be back when the pandemic is over  reported that hundreds of cops will help to keep away the roughly 2000   people who sleep on the subways every night “This is something that’s never really been undertaken to this scale” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a Tuesday press conference “I expect it to be fluid and we will learn from tonight and as we go forward try to develop a system that’s as efficient as possible to get the job done with the minimum amount of officers” The future feels especially shaky in   home of the nation’s oldest subway system and a poster child for unreliable public transit A few years ago the city abruptly withdrew what was seen as a strong bid for the 2024   after incredulous commuters asked how it could even think about hosting the games with a system that often can’t get them to work on time The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority the nation’s fourthbusiest public transit system is now running a modified Saturday schedule and has about 20 percent of its typical ridership on buses On subways ridership is just 8 percent of a typical prepandemic day Despite the skeletal ridership and declining revenue from advertising on buses subways and trams there’s been no talk of shuttering the system even as the virus has sickened dozens of employees — mostly bus drivers — and killed one “We certainly have seen a durable level of ridership” MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak said “We get every indication from the timing of the trips that many of these folks are health care workers and health care personnel” The   approved by   and signed by   included 25 billion in public transit grants to help agencies contend with the coronavirus MBTA chief financial officer Mary Ann O’Hara has said the system should be eligible for about 840 million of those funds The beleaguered transit system — which was already struggling to replace 30yearold subway and trolley cars — is projecting a 231 million budget deficit for the fiscal year that ends June 30 Weekday subway ridership typically tops 5 million in New York City the nation’s busiest public transit system But overall mass transit use has plummeted more than 90 percent in recent weeks The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has received about 38 billion from the relief bill but the agency says it needs double that amount of aid to help cover an operating loss it estimates could reach 85 billion Without additional federal funding MTA head Patrick Foye said “the present and future of the MTA are in serious jeopardy” Meanwhile the agency which has 70000 employees has seen at least 95 employees die from confirmed or suspected COVID19 cases An MTAcommissioned study estimated 60 percent of riders could return to the transit system by fall But Foye acknowledged “no one really knows” if that will happen The pandemic arrived at a time when the proliferation of bikesharing and ridesharing services was already chipping away at subway ridership “A change that was going to take five to 10 years has basically taken place overnight” said Tom Wright president of urban planning think tank Regional Plan Association Against that backdrop New York’s legislature approved a firstinthenation “congestion pricing” plan last year to fund desperately needed improvements to the 116yearold subway system The scheduled early 2021 rollout to charge motorists entering Manhattan’s central business district is now unlikely Foye said In   officials with the nation’s secondbusiest public transit system are using plummeting ridership to shut down stations and accelerate construction plans The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced last month it will suspend Silver Line service and close nine stations in Northern   from Memorial Day through fall to rebuild platforms and connect the Silver Line to the Metro’s existing network Ridership at some stations currently totals just 1200 people per weekday less than 5 percent of normal traffic Metro general manager Paul Wiedefeld said in a statement Even with the economic hit few urban transit systems are trying to boost ridership now Some transportation systems like the Chicago Transit Authority are actively trying to discourage riders who aren’t on a critical mission Others requiring riders to enter and exit buses from the rear door to protect drivers have abandoned some farecollection efforts altogether Even in the midst of the public health crisis transit officials are beginning to think about the future — including how to ensure riders feel safe when maintaining a distance from others at rush hour is hard to imagine The MBTA is already providing bus drivers with a

Doctor a Day a group of doctors who   over the potential health harms of the measures When you look at the data of the deaths and the critically ill they are patients who were very sick to begin with she said Theres always exceptions  But when you look at the pure numbers its overwhelmingly patients who are in nursing homes and patients with serious underlying conditions Meaning that thats where our resources should be spent I think its terribly unethical part of the reason why we let the virus fly through the nursing homes is because were diverting resources across society at large We have limited resources we should put them where its killed people People of all ages of course have been shown to catch the coronavirus And there have been reported health complications even in children that could potentially be   National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr Anthony Fauci in a Senate hearing last week warned that it is still unclear if there could be longterm harm to children associated with the coronavirus “We dont know everything about this virus … especially when it comes to children”   in the Senate hearing “We ought to be careful and not cavalier”  out of work due to the economic shutdowns hospitals deftly managing their coronavirus caseloads without being overwhelmed and some doctors who oppose the shutdowns warning that the health effects of forcing people to stay at home are becoming a mass casualty incident some are aggressively angling to lift the restrictions soon Fauci on the other hand has touted reopening guidelines released by the White House which require states to have two uninterrupted weeks of declining case numbers before proceeding to the first limited reopening phase States would then have to continue to meet certain benchmarks before opening further As I have said many times publicly what we have worked out is a guideline framework for how to open America again” Fauci said at the   last week If some areas – cities states or what have you – jump over those barriers checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks Fauci the face of the White House coronavirus task force added that places that reopen early could bring about preventable suffering and death and turn the clock back instead of going forward The battle over sending children back to school adults back to their offices and letting people engage in activities like eating out or attending sporting events has led to passionate differences in opinion among government officials medical experts and the general population President Trump has repeatedly said he wants to reopen our country while some governors have vowed not to fully reopen until there is a vaccine or a treatment for the coronavirus Until either a proven vaccine is in our midst or proven therapeutics are widely available we cannot firmly enter the new normal which eventually awaits us when life will once again return to all of our workplaces downtowns and main streets New Jersey Gov Phil Murphy said in a press conference earlier this week Most importantly we will continue to be guided by the principle that public health creates economic health And if we begin to see a backslide in public health we will have to also pull back on the reins of our restart Most medical experts including Fauci have urged caution as states move to reopen but some are becoming more concerned about the health effects of continuing the lockdowns  against the coronavirus restrictions have swept through many state capitals but an  NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released Tuesday found 83 percent of Americans are at least somewhat concerned that lifting restrictions in their area will lead to additional infections with 54 percent saying they are very or extremely concerned that such steps will

after May 5 around the time that criticism over New Yorks nursing home fatalities intensified A   saved by the Internet archive Wayback Machine however shows that Cuomos order stated No resident shall be denied readmission or admission to the NH nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID19 NHs Nursing homes are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID19 prior to admission or readmission On May 10 Cuomo   stating that hospitals cannot send patients back to nursing homes in the state unless they tested negative for the virus The move appeared to largely invalidate the March 25 directive However senior Cuomo communications director Peter Ajemian insisted in an email to Fox News that it was not accurate to state that Cuomo had reversed the March 25 order He didnt reverse or rescind anything Ajemian wrote at the time The order is still in effect He did add a directive this one directed at hospitals saying they must test patients and the patients must be negative before being sent back to a nursing home And he is requiring nursing homes to test staff twice a week On Tuesday a Cuomo spokesperson said that the state Department of Health DOH updates its website as a matter of ordinary course to avoid confusion but did not say whether the governors office played a role in the decision to eliminate the text of the March 25 order from the DOH website DOH posted updated guidance that builds on the original March 25 guidance which barred nursing homes from discriminating against COVID patients Ajemian separately told Fox News As we said at the time the updated guidance didn’t supersede the March 25th guidance – rather it added a new requirement that says hospitals cannot discharge patients to nursing homes until they test negative Then and now nursing homes cannot discriminate against COVID patients and they cannot accept patients if they aren’t able to provide adequate care including staff screenings PPE and infection control measures like cohorting On Saturday Cuomo doubled down on his states nowscrapped nursing home policy and instead blamed the problem on   and his administration New York followed the presidents agencies guidance Cuomo said during his press conference  What New York did was follow what the Republican Administration said to do Thats not my attempt to politicize it Its my attempt to depoliticize it So dont criticize the state for following the presidents policy The governors office said New Yorks original nursing home policy was in line with   from the Trump administrations Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services CMS and Centers from Disease Control and Prevention CDC that went out to all states on how to control infections in nursing homes The guidance said nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID19 wasis present Not could Should Melissa DeRosa secretary to the governor and Cuomos top aide said at the Saturday press conference That is President Trumps CMS and CDC There are over a dozen states that did the exact same thing Cuomo has been under scrutiny from GOP politicians who say the governor should have never allowed recovering coronavirus patients to leave hospitals and go back to their residential nursing homes to spread the contagious virus Nursing care facilities home to some of the most vulnerable citizens have been coronavirus hotspots around the country New York leads the nation with the most reported coronavirus nursing home deaths at more than 5000  though the   it counts deaths so the numbers of nursing home patient deaths could be even higher The Daily Caller News Foundation   that in early May the New York State Department of Health quietly switched from disclosing coronavirus deaths of all nursing home and adult care facility residents regardless of whether the patient died at their longterm care facility or at a hospital to only disclosing coronavirus deaths of longterm care patients who died while physically present at their facility Of the nation’s more than 26000 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and longterm care facilities a fifth of them  about 5300  are in New York according to a count by The Associated Press and the toll has been increasing by an average of 20 to 25 deaths a day for the past few weeks “The way this has been handled by the state is totally irresponsible negligent and stupid” said Elaine Mazzotta a nurse whose mother died last month of suspected COVID19 at a Long Island nursing home “They knew better They shouldn’t have sent these people into nursing homes” Another key criticism is that New York took weeks after the first known nursing home outbreaks to begin publicly reporting the number of deaths in individual homes By the time New York began disclosing the deaths in the middle of April the state had several major outbreaks with at least 40 deaths each most of which were a surprise to the surrounding communities and even some family members “The numbers the deaths keep ticking up” said MaryDel

{"3068": "Dr   the face of the   coronavirus task force warned in testimony Tuesday before the   Health Committee that reopening the economy before certain checkpoints set up in the Trump administrations coronavirus recovery plan are met could bring serious consequences As I have said many times publicly what we have worked out is a guideline framework for how to open America again” Fauci said referencing a set of guidelines the White House has released for states and localities to begin opening their economies In order to proceed to the first of three stages states would need to see an uninterrupted decrease in coronavirus cases over a 14day period Depending on the dynamics of an outbreak in a particular region state city or area that would really determine the speed and the pace with which one does reenter or reopen Fauci said If some areas – cities states or what have you – jump over those barriers checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks Fauci warned that prematurely lifting coronavirus restrictions closing schools and businesses and limiting travel would lead to suffering and death and turn the clock back instead of going forward When asked by Sen Patty Murray DWash what could happen if areas do ignore the checkpoints Fauci said The consequences could be really serious Further when asked by Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass if the virus was under control Fauci said it is not Right now it depends on what you mean by containment Fauci said noting the virus is not completely under control So when you look at the dynamics of new cases even though some are coming down the curve looks flat with some coming down So I think were going in the right direction but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak He added that without proper measures the US could face a resurgence in cases He said the US should be in a much better place by the fall but said if adequate measures are not taken there will be problems The time for magical thinking is over here Warren said of President Trumps pushes to reopen the economy quickly and optimism that the virus will go away The hearing which features Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID as well as three other top administration health officials is the biggest congressional hearing since the coronavirus crisis began It comes as states across the country are plotting their own courses for reopening their economies with some already opening sectors and others maintaining strict lockdowns President Trump himself has stressed the importance of getting America back to work leading to criticism from some Democrats that this approach could be too risky Fauci did not rip on the Trump administrations response to the pandemic in his planned remarks instead emphasizing efforts by the National Institutes of Health NIH to develop vaccines and other medical means to fight the coronavirus Hopefully our research efforts together with the other public health efforts will get us quickly to an end to this terrible ordeal that we are all going through Fauci said NIH is focused on developing safe and effective COVID19 vaccines and therapeutics and sensitive specific and rapid pointofcare diagnostic tests Fauci also said in written remarks submitted to the committee These efforts will improve our response to the current pandemic and bolster our preparedness for the next inevitable emerging disease outbreak On one point Fauci said the government is focusing on several different vaccine candidates using the hockey term multiple shots on goal to describe the increased chances that one would work Additionally he said if more than one is successful that would help increase the availability of the vaccines globally But Fauci noted theres no guarantee that a vaccine is going to be effective Given the chance to attack Trump in an exchange with Sen Tim Kaine DVa Fauci declined to Kaine pushed Fauci on whether South Koreas success on fighting the coronavirus showed that the US response to the pandemic was inadequate Fauci noted that there is a big difference between the US and South Korea Fauci appeared remotely due to concerns that he might have been exposed to the coronavirus Multiple senators also appeared virtually for the hearing including Sen Lamar Alexander RTenn the chairman of the committee and Murray the ranking member After consulting with Dr Fauci and in an abundance of caution for our witnesses senators and the staff all four Administration witnesses will appear by videoconference due to these unusual circumstances Alexander said in a statement Alexander in his opening remarks emphasized the necessity of testing and also said the government might make an effort to massmanufacture a vaccine before it’s been proven to work so it can be quickly distributed once it’s officially approved “Those vaccines those treatments are the ultimate solution” he said “But until we have them all roads back to work and school go through testing Murray wasted no time hitting the president in her opening remarks Families across the country are counting on us for the truth about the COVID19 pandemic especially since it is clear they will not get it from President Trump she said Truth is essential The president isnt telling the truth We must And our witnesses must She also criticized the Trump administrations tangible response to the virus saying it has been marked by delays and insufficient assistance to states and health professionals Additionally she advocated for another coronavirus stimulus bill to help ease the burden of the economic shutdowns across the country aimed at slowing the spread of the virus Fauci when questioned by Alexander said it would not be reasonable to expect a vaccine to be ready for backtoschool season this year Trump has said he would like to have a vaccine by the end of the year The idea of having treatments or a vaccine  ready by the fall  would be something of a bridge too far he said Fauci also added that there is a good chance to see further rebounds in the disease but that he hopes the US will be better prepared to deal with them I would hope that if we do have the threat of a second wave we will be able to deal with it very effectively to prevent it from becoming an outbreak Not only what weve seen now but much much less he said Admiral Brett Giroir the Assistant Secretary for Health emphasized that the US had conducted more than 9 million COVID19 tests a number far greater than any other country and double the per capita tests performed to date in South Korea a nation that many have held up as the model for handling the coronavirus effects He noted that by the late summer and early fall he expected the US to be able to perform between 40 and 50 million coronavirus tests per month Fauci got into a dustup with Sen Rand Paul RKy over Pauls criticism of some of the prognostications that have come from public health experts and the push to reopen schools quickly The history of this will be wrong prediction after wrong prediction after wrong predicition Paul said mentioning among several other examples Sweden which left its schools open I dont think youre an endall I dont think youre the one person that gets to make a decision I have never made myself out to be the endall and only voice in this Fauci said Im a scientist a physician and a public health official I give advice according to the best scientific evidence He continued emphasizing that it is not clear children are generally immune from the harmful effects of the coronavirus We should be humble about what we dont know And I think that falls under the fact that we dont know everything about this virus and we really got to be very careful particularly when it comes to children Because the more and more we learn were seeing things about what this virus can do that we didnt see from the studies in China or in Europe During questioning selfproclaimed Democratic socialist Sen Bernie Sanders IVt pushed the witnesses on whether or not a vaccine once developed would be broadly available to people regardless of their income If Godwilling a vaccine is developed and if were able to produce it as quickly as we all hope we can I imagine that that vaccine would be distributed to all people free of charge or at least make sure that everybody in America that needs that vaccine will get it regardless of their income Sanders asked Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn Hahn said that issue was not under his purview as the FDA commissioner but Giroir said he would advocate within the Trump administration to make sure the vaccine is accessible They should gain access to it  I will certainly advocate that everyone is able to receive the vaccine regardless of income or any other circumstance Hahn said Democrats ahead of the hearing made clear they saw it as an opportunity to separate Fauci from President Trump whom the medical expert is almost always with when he appears publicly so that Fauci will feel free to criticize Trump Critics of the president have argued his response to the coronavirus crisis was wholly inadequate alleging Trump initially downplayed the threat before letting petty politics get in the way of helping states and then moving too quickly to reopen the economy Until now weve mostly heard from the members of the coronavirus task force through the distorted lens of the White House press conference where the president often prevents them from answering fully interrupts their response or even contradicts their factbased evidence Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer DNY said on Monday This will be one of the first opportunities for Dr Fauci to tell the American people the unvarnished truth without the president lurking over his shoulder Dr Fauci let it rip he added Trump previously blocked Fauci from appearing before a House committee saying the members of the Democratcontrolled House are haters Fauci like he had previously avoided criticizing Trump directly on Tuesday but did issue stern warnings on what could happen if measures to slow the diseases spread are lifted too soon Under questioning from Sen Kelly Loeffler RGa all four witnesses said their relationships with the president are not confrontational and said they felt free to give their opinions and advice on the coronavirus pandemic Fauci was joined by Dr Robert Redfield the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Hahn and Giroir"},

limitations of space we are not doing this referring to social distancing “Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed US nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure  This is a necessary risk” Crozier continued “Keeping over 4000 young men and women on board the TR is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those Sailors entrusted to our care” Trump on Monday said Crozier shouldnt have sent the 4page letter in an unclassified and unsecured manner but the president added that he did not want to destroy somebody for having a bad day On Saturday though Trump had taken a harder line on Crozier “I thought it was terrible what he did to write a letter I mean this isnt a class on literature Trump remarked This is a captain of a massive ship thats nuclear powered And he shouldnt be talking that way in a letter After Croziers letter became public Modly then flew to the ship at port in Guam and delivered a speech to the crew in which he lambasted Crozier saying he was either “too naive or too stupid” to be in charge of an aircraft carrier  or perhaps leaked the letter intentionally Modly charged that Crozier had allowed details of the ships operational security to become public either recklessly or intentionally “If he Crozier didn’t think in my opinion that this information the letter wasn’t going to get out into the public in this day and information age that we live in then he was either A too naive or too stupid to be a commanding officer of a ship like this Modly said The alternative is that he did this on purpose “So think about that when you cheer the man off the ship who exposed you to that” Modly added “I understand you love the guy It’s good that you love him But you’re not required to love him” Modly had relieved Crozier of command of the aircraft carrier last week He said hed lost confidence in Crozier for having shown “extremely poor judgment” in widely distributing a memo pleading for an accelerated evacuation of the crew members to protect their health Esper’s staff told Modly he must apologize according to a person familiar with the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation On Monday night Modly issued his public apology Let me be clear I do not think Captain Brett Crozier is naive nor stupid Modly said referring to his speech aboard the Roosevelt on Sunday I think and always believed him to be the opposite We pick our carrier commanding officers with great care Captain Crozier is smart and passionate “I apologize for any confusion this choice of words may have caused” Modley continued “I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier his family and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused” Meanwhile the   showing Croziers crew cheering him as he was relieved of duty rocketed around the internet and so did  As public pressure increased calls among Democrats in Congress for Modlys resignation were also mounting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCaif called on Modly to be removed from his post saying in a statement that he showed “a serious lack of the sound judgment and strong leadership” in firing Crozier Acting Secretary Modly’s actions and words demonstrate his failure to prioritize the force protection of our troops” Pelosi said Rep Adam Smith DWashington accused Modly of wanting to impress Trump When I listened to the speech that Modly gave  he was trying to do a half aed attempt at a speech that Trump would have given Smith said Hes trying to figure out what would the narcissist do  people are trying to figure out how to lead when their example is someone who is not competent or capable Smith continued Look let me just say that I have worked with Esper and Modly for a long time  I think very highly of them their skill their competence and their ability I see Trumps creeping inserting himself like when Trump got involved with Eddie Gallagher Trump is at the top of the chain of command "},

{"7444": " said Wednesday he could not confirm the veracity of the numbers of   and deaths being reported by China as he warned Americans to brace for more “horrific” days in dealing with the virus While Trump said the numbers being reported by Beijing “seem to be a little on the light side” the president and National Security Adviser Robert C OBrien said they currently have no way to confirm the number of COVID19 cases being reported by the Chinese government The comments follow  that China is underreporting its cases “We are not in the position to confirm any of the numbers coming from China” O’Brien said during the daily White House coronavirus task force press briefing “We just have no way to confirm any of those numbers” The president put it more bluntly “As far as the numbers I’m not an accountant from China” Trump also   that the country is in for a hard time as it continues to battle the virus We are going to have a couple of weeks starting pretty much now but especially a few days from now that are going to be horrific Trump said The White House announced on Tuesday the extension of the social distancing guidelines after Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and other public health officials on the White House coronavirus task force ominously warned that even if the US were to continue to do what it was doing  keeping the economy closed and most Americans in their homes  the coronavirus could still leave 100000 to 240000 people in the United States dead and millions infected Without any measures in place to mitigate the contagions spread those projections jump to between 15 and 22 million deaths from COVID19 To slow the spread of the virus Trump said his administration is weighing stopping domestic flights in the US although he he is reticent to do so given the economic impact and said if implemented it would only be from virus hot spots He also advised faith leaders against violating stayathome orders and holding services amid reports of some churches holding gatherings “If you do that you are really giving this invisible enemy a really big advantage he said With the US leading the world in the number of confirmed cases  by almost 100000  both public health officials and lawmakers in the United States have expressed skepticism about the numbers of coronavirus cases coming out of China  fueled by official efforts to quash bad news in the early days and a general distrust of the government Long lines of people waiting to collect the ashes of loved ones at funeral homes last week revived the debate The outbreak began in China’s Hubei province  specifically in the city of Wuhan  in late 2019 and has resulted in about 82000 cases and 3300 deaths in the country according to numbers compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering CSSE at Johns Hopkins University The US has reported more than 206000 cases and more than 4000 deaths The health system in Wuhan the city where threefourths of Chinas victims died was overwhelmed at the peak of the outbreak Hospitals overflowed patients with symptoms were sent home and there werent enough kits to test everyone In any country getting a complete picture in the fog of war is virtually impossible For the last two weeks Wuhan has reported no new cases almost every day Its a remarkable decline from the thousands it reported every day until midFebruary and the hundreds into early March But China decided early to stop including in its count those who test positive for the virus but dont have any symptoms The World Health Organization asks member countries to report asymptomatic labconfirmed cases though most with big outbreaks dont have the testing capacity to identify them Earlier on Wednesday Rep Michael McCaul the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee ramped up his call for the State Department to investigate China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic following a report that the Chinese Communist Party concealed the extent of the outbreak and underreported the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the country The report by US intelligence officials which was first published by Bloomberg says that leaders in Beijing intentionally underreported the number of COVID19 cases and deaths “Even before news of this report was released it was clear that the Chinese Communist Party is not a trustworthy partner in the fight against COVID19” McCaul said in a statement “They lied to the world about the human to human transmission of the virus silenced doctors and journalists who tried to report the truth and are now apparently hiding the accurate number of people impacted by this disease” During the press conference Trump deferred in answering a question about the intelligence report saying only that he has a good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping but the numbers did seem low given the vastness of the contagion’s outbreak in China “The numbers seem to be a little on the light side relative to what we have witnessed and what was reported” Trump said China also has a history of downplaying and covering up issues ranging from public health crises and national disasters to economic issues and toxic consumer products Seventeen years ago China tried to cover up the extent of the SARS outbreak another coronavirus that spread beyond its borders The government is being far more open this time but it cant shake the distrust at home and abroad “The Chinese government has been taking an open transparent and responsible attitude all along and publishing the latest figures to the world every day Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Wednesday Overseas researchers have long been skeptical of Chinese economic reports that show high and unusually stable growth for a developing country The economy might be up to 21 smaller than official data indicate according to a 2018 study by Yingyao Hu and Jiaxiong Yao of Johns Hopkins University With coronavirus China has played up the efforts of the Communist Party and the sacrifices of medical workers to tackle the crisis while suppressing reports about hospital overcrowding and reprimanding medical workers for rumormongering after they tried to raise the alarm about the emergence of a possible new disease Its a formula that invites skepticism whether the government is telling the truth or not Along with expressing skepticism in Chinas reporting the Trump administration  that the US military was stepping up its efforts to combat drug trafficking as reports surface that Mexican cartels are looking to exploit the pandemic to smuggle more cocaine and heroin into the country There is a growing threat that cartels malign actors and other criminals will try to exploit the situation for their own gain Trump said We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives"},
{"4816": "DANA PERINO FOX NEWS HOST Good evening everyone the 2020 race entering a new phase with Joe Biden getting out of the basement and going after President Trump In one of his sharpest attacks yet the former vice president holding his a first news conference in 89 days where he repeatedly attacked the president over the Coronavirus pandemic and more Watch  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  JOE BIDEN D PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE Despite the administrations propaganda that their response should be a cause for celebration despite President Trumps request that we should slow down testing because he thinks it makes him look bad the COVID19 is still here and the daily threat to American health and prosperity is continuing  Month after month as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control Donald Trump fails And it seems like our wartime president surrendered waved the white flag left the battlefield Perhaps we need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public period  You call yourself a cheerleader We dont need a cheerleader Mr President We need a president Mr President  END VIDEO CLIP  PERINO Joe Biden adding that he can hardly wait to debate President Trump And we will get underway here I want to point out that we have some great guests We have people on THE FIVE not just guests We have Dan Bongino Donna Brazile and Kennedy And you might be wondering where is Jesse Watters Jesse Watters is here We just cant see him quite yet  And we are working on that minor technical difficulty And we will bring you Jesse Watters as soon as he is available So never fear Jesse Watters is coming So we have a lot to get to We will talk about all of this I felt Donna that if you were following this event today that Joe Biden had That if youre following on Twitter the partisans on both sides it was quite predictable  On the left wow Biden is so presidential so fair Oh my gosh hes going to be great On the right it was this guy is lost hes terrible Hell never be able to beat Donald Trump From your  putting your Electoral College hat on when you watch something like that today from Joe Biden do you think it puts him on a path to be able to maintain some of those high poll numbers that hes had in the past month  DONNA BRAZILE FOX NEWS HOST First of all its good to see all of you And hello Dan you came to Washington DC and you didnt even come to visit me Ive made some special Jambalaya for you and you didnt even show up So forget you next time sugar  CROSSTALK  BRAZILE Jesse nots here Jesse came  Jesse doesnt like to come on when Im here Baby come on Jesse I miss you too Dana look I thought Joe Biden did a fabulous job What he did was he laid out his plan He gave us a plan back in March What he did today was update us on what he will be doing once hes elected  First he wants to keep Dr Fauci on board to continue the leadership hes provided on the COVID task force And he also talked about additional steps that we need to take to reduce the spread of the virus and to ensure that states have what they need He basically called on the president to use the power of his office to get this thing under control  PERINO All right So Dan Bongino theres a different perspective right which we have The Republicans saying no The president he still has his fastball He has the power of incumbency He had an economic record that he can utilize as he shows that the nation is coming back from the pandemic and the economic destruction your take on todays event  DAN BONGINO FOX NEWS HOST Well youre right by the way If you came in to this with a partisan mind its not a secret Im a conservative You know you didnt leave having your mind changed I dont think by anything Your analysis there is pretty accurate But putting aside the presentation component of  getting to the substance  There were really a couple things that came out today about Biden on substance that are really devastating I will get to the Coronavirus thing in a second But he came out today basically telling America and the middle class most importantly which provides the bulk of voters hey your taxes are going up a lot because he wants to get rid of the Trump tax cuts  Now you know again I know some people have a tough time with numbers Not on this show but some partisans So if you were a recipient of the Trump tax cut in the middle class you got a four percentage point tax cut or a three percentage point tax cut Or if youre in the lower income categories you got a three percentage point tax cut  The rich only got one or maybe two if youre at the upper end So basically what hes saying is the middle class  Im going to put a massive tax hike on the middle class Listen to my liberal friends those are just numbers Thats what he said Not my words Im not running for office Dan Bongino On the Corona thing I find it interesting that Biden all of a sudden has found religion  Again when President Trump put forth the travel ban he was attacked by Biden and Bidens media allies saying you know this was an overreaction this has basically had tinges of xenophobia I mean this is the guy whos been on the wrong side of just about every foreign policy decision in decades So you know its kind of rich of him now coming out and being the Monday morning quarterback here  PERINO He also talked a little bit about something that has been in the news a lot lately Kennedy And that was  is this whole issue of the vandalism against statues across America regardless of the historical significance of that individual even if they are abolitionist So he finally weighed in on this Lets take a listen  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  BIDEN All those Confederate monuments to Confederate soldiers and generals who strongly supported secession  in the name of slavery and going to war to do it I think those statues belong in museums They dont belong in public places And I think with regard to those statues that are in monuments like the Jefferson Memorial  I think theres an obligation that the government protect those monuments because they are different than  thats a remembrance and is not a  dealing with you know revering somebody who had that view  END VIDEO CLIP  PERINO Kennedy lets get your take while we still work on this technical difficulty of trying to get Jesse Watters back up to get his opinion on this before we have to go to commercial break Kennedy what did you think about him finally weighing in on this issue  LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY FOX NEWS HOST He had to weigh in on it And he really did And you have to take a strong position here Its one of those issues where you cant have it both ways And there are differentiations to be made And I think he actually did a pretty good job of that because obviously tearing down a statue of Ulysses S Grant is vastly different than tearing down a statue of his nemesis Robert E Lee  And I think its valid to say that yes We do have to study The Civil War We have to understand the confederacy We have to understand what tore this nation apart And I think that is a completely valid  but statues revere these people And I think we are at a point in our modern history where we dont have to revere people who fought to the death to the tune of hundreds of thousands of people to maintain slavery  So Im glad he did that I do think that we need some reputational damage for Ulysses S Grant And also the vice president  the former vice president talked about his cognitive pluses and how his cognitive functioning is so much better than Donald Trumps The only way we are going to solve this is if during a debate they are both given phones  And they have to download a Dominos Pizza app on their own and then they have to order a pizza And whoever gets their pizza first they get to be president  PERINO Kennedy that might be the best way to end a debate of which there will be three of them at least So I was going to say Jesse what do you think Oh Dana this is what I think it And I was going to do Jesses World but we are going to get them back for you We promise Were still working on that Coming up defund the police could be a reality in Americas biggest city as it grapples with a surge in violent crime We have an update on that Theres a vote coming up soon  COMMERCIAL BREAK  PERINO The far left could get their wish in defunding the police this time in the nations biggest city Protesters outside city hall ahead of a vote that will cut or transfer 1 billion from the NYPD it comes during a surge in violent crime But Mayor De Blasio backing the move  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE My office presented to the city council a plan that would achieve 1 billion in savings for the NYPD and shift resources to young people to communities in a way that would help address a lot of these underlying issues  END VIDEO CLIP  PERINO All right Now so were in our Bblock And I have to phone a friend phone a friend from Jesse Watters He has sent me a note And he said Donna he heard you talking trash so its not that he cant hear And hes doing his best to make it on air Its just a technical difficulty Were working on that And we will maybe get  Jesse sent me another text and I will read it on air  Kennedy I want to go to you about this issue in terms of defunding the police You are a mom You live in the city And I wonder what you are feeling right now as the crime rates in the city continue to skyrocket  MONTGOMERY A majority of New Yorkers people who live in the five rurals ph of New York City they do not want to defund to police They actually have good interactions with the NYPD And by and large they want that institution to stay intact The problem with Mayor De Blasio is he is a commie Hes talking  hes using the word redistribution like a shameful pinko ph  And whats going to happen here  and this is what is so awful is they are going to demoralize the department so badly Youre not going to have necessary philosophical changes needed for true police reform Whats going to happen is youre going to have more officers leaving the department going to different departments or leaving the profession entirely  Crime is going to go up And then youre going to see unfortunately a mass exodus of people who now because of the pandemic can work from home And they dont want to pay exorbitant taxes that are going to programs that are toothless and totally undeserving  PERINO Dan Bongino you served in the NYPD They are facing a vote here at 600 pm a 1 billion would be taken away except it sounds like its also even just symbolic Actually they wouldnt really take the money away They just would say that they will And that thats supposedly is going to solve things  BONGINO Its not all symbolic One of the tenets of this was the removal of 1000 people from a recruit class 1000 cops I mean put that in perspective I think the entire county I live in in Florida probably only has 200 or may be 300 cops Im not even sure Youre going to remove 1000 from one class Now Dana its not like we havent been here before  I feel  did you ever read comic books Like they had Bizarro Superman when you were a kid where everything is backwards or remember the Seinfeld episode where George does everything backwards and it works out Well this isnt that way George does everything backwards and nothing will work out OK Weve already been here in New York  Anyone remember Ed Koch or David Dinkins Now David Dinkins when thousands of people were murdered on the streets of New York City and he lost his election to a Republican in a two to one New York City Democrat to a Republican enclave And then Giuliani wins reelection over Ruth Messinger by 17 points in New York City Its because people had enough Dana not surprisingly of things like getting killed  Thats not a sales pitch for your city Weve been here De Blasios going there again And one more quick thing its not just the loss of recruits in the defunding of the police Getting rid of the anticrime unit the plainclothes police units will be the single most catastrophic decision youve seen yet Youre already seeing murders spike  I mean its beyond the scope of this conversation But I will explain why maybe on another show sometimes but devastatingly bad decision  PERINO Donna Joe Biden has said he does not believe in defunding the police And there in NYPD you actually I think have 60 percent of the police officers are nonwhite The fact that you have people demoralized not wanting to be police officers And now you have 1000 recruits that cant even get trained in order to become police officers eventually  Why wouldnt somebody like Bill De Blasio or the Democrats say instead of taking money from the police why dont we add money for additional support if they want to add social workers or programs for children Like maybe  isnt that a better way to approach this for Democrats Instead you are facing a situation where people are going to say they are not for this  BRAZILE Well Dana as you well know all across the country not just in big cities small cities Many city councils as well as mayors have taken a look at their overall budget They are in a budget shortfall given the money that has spent on COVID and trying to prevent to spread And so what these police departments are doing at this hour is not just looking at the role of the police departments  But also looking at how to decriminalize some of these things that the police departments are doing they are reallocating funding Theyre re imagining what the police department should look like in the 21st century I applaud all the mayors and city councils that are taking a look at their budgets taking a look at what theyre going to do here in the District of Columbia  The mayor is talking about adding to it Overall over the last 10 years you seen a 14 15 percent increase in policing because police are called to do everything   CROSSTALK  BRAZILE Increase But there are policemen  and by the way I have policemen in my family They are called to do everything They are called to handle domestic disputes Theyre called when homeless people fall asleep on the park bench They are called to do everything So they are looking at ways to put resources in other city budgets that may also contribute to public safety and preventing crimes and not just funding the police department  CROSSTALK  PERINO Let me jump in if you dont mind So the former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly he was on earlier with  obviously he oversaw the police department at a time when crime was down Now its going up Take a listen  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE The NYPD or the city is surrendering as far as violent crime is concerned Hes the one thats made these decisions He saps the strength of the NYPD since he took office in 2014  END VIDEO CLIP  PERINO Dan one of the things that De Blasio said today was that even though he sees the crime rates going way up He still thinks he can manage to keep the city safe even if they cut 1 billion from the NYPD  BONGINO Yeah But Dana hes not You know I said yesterday Do we believe in facts and data Is anybody doing that anymore or are we just in a postfact society Shootings are up dramatically Police retirements are up dramatically Cops are coming off the street Assaults autocrimes everything is up I mean does that even matter  If I just Donna with all due respect I just want to challenge two things You know you said about the budget cuts I agree with you Budget cuts are going to happen I totally agree with you And even the police department is going to have to look at a way to find efficiencies But you dont cut 1 billion from the PD in a hierarchy of needs  You may want to consider other cuts before security And secondly I cant do the reimagine the police line anymore Im serious Every single Democrat on television uses this line We dont have to reimagine policing We did it in the early 90s It was called Broken Windows And literally tens of thousands of lives in largely minority communities in New York City were safe  There are people alive today because we implemented and actually re imagined policing That seems to be   CROSSTALK  BRAZILE Don  Don  Dan if we are going to try to reform the police department where they continue to use excessive force if they continue to not be properly trained if they continue to kill innocent people Dan So if you dont want to reimagine then reform it so that people are not afraid of police officers who are paid to protect and serve the citizens of their community  CROSSTALK  BRAZILE So I think we both agree   CROSSTALK  BRAZILE I think we both agree of that we should respect our men and women the police department But they should understand that they serve the community And I think what is coming out of the movement that were seeing across the country is that we want a police department that serves the community and not   CROSSTALK  PERINO I am going to let Kennedy have the last word here Because what really is frustrating about this past month and a half is that there is a lot of agreement There is a lot of agreement And you can solve these problems pretty easily if you took the politics out of it Kennedy  MONTGOMERY Yes absolutely And its interesting because Dan and Donna are actually saying some of the same things And when you talk about re imagining the police department youre not necessarily saying get rid of the police And I think everyone agrees that we ask too much out of men and women in law enforcement We do ask them to be social workers  We ask them to be domestic referees We ask them to save our lives We want to be able to call them when our safety is in jeopardy But Dan unfortunately it doesnt work flawlessly and seamlessly in every department And there are certain things and there are certain lists we could make about noknock warrants and in mandatory body cams and qualified immunity And those irrational   CROSSTALK  BONGINO You dont seriously want to get rid of qualified immunity do you I mean do you understand   CROSSTALK  BONGINO Lisa come on If you get rid of qualified immunity you will never ever recruit a police officer again  CROSSTALK  MONTGOMERY What Im asking for is not hyperbole because that type of hyperbole doesnt solve the problems that we have And wearing blinders and saying policing is perfect that also doesnt do it  CROSSTALK  MONTGOMERY I understand that And so did  like Donna I have family members in law enforcement I love them Theyre the kind of cops that I want on the street There are bad cops out there who do bad things And we have to make sure theres more accountability  BRAZILE Thank you  PERINO All right you guys good talk There is a something happening something happening with Jesse I believe  CROSSTALK  PERINO Democrats attacking the president over the Russia bounty controversy how the White House is responding next and also some sort of Jesse surprise  COMMERCIAL BREAK  MONTGOMERY The White House blasting leaks as Democrats pounce on media reports about Russian bounties on American soldiers top House Democrats attacking President Trump after being briefed at the White House today watch  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE This was a red flag It either was not waived or the president ignored the wave  UNIDENTIFIED MALE When it comes to Vladimir Putin this president just seems to think that hes the greatest thing going  UNIDENTIFIED MALE There maybe a reluctance to brief the president on things he doesnt want to hear And that may be more true with respect to Putin and Putins Russia Many of us do not understand his affinity for that autocratic ruler who means our nation ill  END VIDEO CLIP  MONTGOMERY And Joe Biden joining in on the criticism Joe  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  BIDEN The idea that somehow he didnt know or isnt being briefed That is a dereliction of duty if thats the case And if he was briefed and nothing was done about this that is a dereliction of duty  END VIDEO CLIP  MONTGOMERY Jesse is here Jesse Watters back in action There you are Donna Brazile is waving to you so I will let you have the first bite at this apple my friend though What do make of what we heard today from some of the Democrats on their briefing  JESSE WATTERS FOX NEWS HOST AUDIO GAP to get away with all that stuff AUDIO GAP  MONTGOMERY I cant  Jesse take a pause for a second Were going to work on your audio OK Im going to go to Dana because Dana youve covered this extensively today at 200 pm Eastern on the DAILY BRIEFING  So give us a little bit of clarity here for people who are sort of just tuning into the story Its a little confusing and they cant really tell who to be mad at because the Department of Defense is saying that they could not assess a credible threat There are sources within the White House saying that the White House and the President himself knew as  long ago as early 2019 So what do we know and what in the world did they know  PERINO Well heres the thing about when youre  when you have a leak from an intelligence source or wherever it came from I dont know what the source is but when you have a leak like this its very hard to have clarity because theres clearly not clarity within the 17 intelligence agencies  Intelligence is nuanced and its difficult And you have people that try to put together lots of different puzzle pieces and get it all together And its never perfect Its just  its just not its assessment Theres one part of the Intelligence Community that says we are solid on this We know that the Russians were paying the Taliban in order to put hits on American soldiers and other ones like you said DOD is like were not so sure thats exactly what was happening  So there is a controversy Now I do think its appropriate that the members of Congress were brief the Republicans and the Democrats have both had some sort of briefing The Democrats not satisfied They want someone from the Intelligence Community to brief them And look its important enough that you had someone today point out that Secretary Pompeo has called the leader over in Afghanistan and said hey its better not be happening or make sure that youre following you know our rules of engagement here  And so I dont know that thats an exact quote but thats like to set the stage for people The political question unfortunately immediately becomes what did the President know and when did he know it When I actually think the more important question is now that everybody knows that this is a possibility how can we get more clarity and more importantly what do we do if anything about it  MONTGOMERY Absolutely right  PERINO And that question is so much more important than the political one  MONTGOMERY Yes but  and were bringing in Pete Hegseth Look at that Hes the Jimmy Garoppolo to Jesse Watters Tom Brady He has a mean arm and handsome GQ looks So Pete lets go to you because how can you trust a story like this in an election year It could be explosive it also could be very exploitable So how do you trust it right now  HEGSETH Yes Well Im always on standby for my dear friend Jesse Watters Im happy to be here Hey I think you have to step back and look at the fact that the Trump administration has a different foreign policy than previous administrations more skeptical of foreign interventions  Weve also known that Russia has paid Islamists for decades Lets not forget we paid the Mujahideen to fight the Russians decades ago as well This is not a new practice Im not OK with it Russia is our enemy We know that But also if who knew what and when is important but ultimately I want the president to make the decision he thinks is best strategically significant for our nation  Just because a bounty was put out by Putin against Americans through Islamist doesnt necessarily we should get re entangled in Afghanistan where weve invested trillions and lost thousands of lives So I do think the policy discussion becomes very important and doing nothing or at least not overreacting is a policy perspective  I also think we should believe the White House when they say hey the President was briefed on this because maybe the Intel wasnt where it should be  MONTGOMERY All right so Donna I want to ask you because this is not the first administration whos had problems with Russia and I think youd be hardpressed to find an administration that got it right So Joe Biden obviously you know hes going to do his Monday morning quarterbacking with you know what the President might have known and what the implications could be from that intelligence  But his boss President Obama certainly laid the groundwork of apathy for a relationship with Russia to continue to rot So why do you think that President Obama did it right in terms of Russia and will Joe Biden continue that  BRAZILE Heres what I want to say because I understand that every time you have a conversation and Donald Trump is blamed for something you have to bring it back to Barack Obama George Bush Abraham Lincoln I dont really care  President Trump has now known for four days four days that the Russians may have spent money to try to kill our troops Four days what the hell are you going to do about it Mr President Are you going to let Mr Putin kill out damn troops Are you going to get off your butt and get out of the damn bunker and send a message to President Putin that were not going to tolerate this Are you just going to let this be a political football that we have a conversation about  Heres my point The GRU attacked us in 2016 And youre right President Obama didnt do enough When he did impose sanctions it wasnt enough because the Russians continue to do it So either you get on the money and you get right at this point and address it to the country and it tell the mothers and fathers of our troops what youre going to do right now or are we going to play political football with their lives  Lets stop playing this game of football because its our troops And I can tell you as a daughter of a veteran if I knew that somebody put a bounty on somebody served in my military I would not be sitting here trying to play some damn game Get off your behind and address this I have to say that  MONTGOMERY All right Dan Bongino   BRAZILE I do not like Putin I do not like Putin   MONTGOMERY I dont either I dont either I dont trust him  BRAZILE  so do not make me kiss his ass because Im not going to kiss his behind  MONTGOMERY Well and every president has you know since Abraham Lincoln Thats how old Vladimir Putin is OK thats very good  BRAZILE And stop kissing his behind Do not kiss his behind  MONTGOMERY I got great lip gloss on right now Im not going to ruin it Im going to go to Dan Bongino for reaction Go Dan  BONGINO Well Donna that was  that was nice but you refuted your own point You know you said at the end if I knew Putin was doing this and you dont And as a matter of fact nobody in the Intel Community did either  Now let me just do a quick story When I received an intel brief  this is why you dont make decisions based on information thats not confirmed You know when you were in the Secret Service we had Obama going over to Indonesia that something fishy happened in a hotel It turned out to be completely innocent  Someone wanted to call off the whole trip Dont get him to go to the hotel It was dangerous You know why we didnt do that because it wasnt verified Intel And when we verified it it turned out to be phony So I mean again Donna you refuted your own point You said if I knew  BRAZILE No I did not Dan You must have   BONGINO You dont know You dont know  BRAZILE You probably  you did not hear my point You heard  my point is   BONGINO No I heard your point  BRAZILE Look there are stories out there Dan that theres a lot of information that it was in the briefing Now if the president didnt see it and didnt hear it fine Weve known now for four days All of us Dan  BONGINO Its not the point  BRAZILE What is he going to do now  MONTGOMERY OK all right were going to  these love birds are going to have to patch it up during the break Coming up next however Dr Anthony Fauci warns we could be hitting a startling number of cases per day if we dont turn this virus bus around That is next  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BRAZILE Welcome back Dr Anthony Fauci is warning that the United States could see 100000 more new Coronavirus cases per day if we dont get our act together It comes as state pause reopening Some business owners are frustrated after following the rules  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE I think that the bars that were breaking the rules the enforcement should be put upon them instead of clobbering an entire industry If you have a few people a few bad apples I dont understand why hes pulling it for everybody  END VIDEO CLIP  BRAZILE Hey brother Dan man look I mean at least a dozen states are now considering reverts and reopening plans I was home this past week in Louisiana I was very happy to see people outside eating You know his crawfish season shrimp season You know people like to sit outside with a plate and everything  Hey what can we do to get these states and these jurisdictions to follow the guidelines so that we can get back to work and reopen our you know entire country What can we do  BONGINO Well I just cant understand why this issue is constantly got to be a political football I mean everybody says we believe in the science and the science is pretty clear You know we were told reopening was going to cause mass chaos in the state of Georgia That didnt happen  Having said that we do know this is a deadly disease potentially for people who are seniors comorbidities or obese have diabetes we know that If you are not one of those categories however its dangerous but its very rarely fatal These are just scientific facts  Also when you look at states that reopened or kept portions of their economy open like Florida weve had 15 deaths per hundred thousand people New York which locked down practically the entire state has 161 deaths per hundred thousand people So can we just accept the fact that maybe these mass lockdowns are not the answer I mean really numbers should mean something  BRAZILE Hey Kennedy look I know youre not a doctor but the CDC says that its spreading too rapidly to be controlled I mean so clearly were not following the guidelines When I say we I mean the American people Were not following the guidelines  MONTGOMERY I think some people are not I think some people are more susceptible to it than we know And thats the problem is really understanding this virus takes precious time And every time we think were ahead of it and this is what Dr Fauci warned you get you go two steps forward youre going to go a step back And I think that is what has happened here  But locking everything down completely and snuffing these businesses out permanently is not the way to go And thats why businesses you know you see a lot of places that say face masks required in order to enter the premises and I think thats completely fair And its up to the states case by case state by state but locking everything down interminably is not the way to go  BRAZILE Well Dana dont you think if the states are facing some testing shortfalls this is where the federal government might be able to step up to ensure that we have enough testing going on so that we can track the spread and see whats happening out there  PERINO Yes sure I mean I think that theres enough testing now I believe I think its one of the reasons you see so many  that the case number is going up But you do have hospitalizations up in certain places But I really want to also say that if these governors like the ones in New York New Jersey and Connecticut are going to all of a sudden pull back and say to these restaurants and businesses but restaurants in particular that you thought because we told you you were going to be able to have in person dining this Thursday  So they planned for that They bought food for that Now all of a sudden they find out oh thats not true So now theyve wasted all of that money So they were in locked down They try to be able to take care of their workers to take care of their people Now theyre trying to come back to work Theyre trying to get people to come back out And what happens they pull it back and now theyre out that money as well Thats where I feel like the government is not being very smart and not helping these businesses at all And thats a real shame  BRAZILE And thats true Hey my friend Pete Look the European Union is reopening its borders tomorrow but they said to us Americans dont fly here What do you say  HEGSETH I didnt know the European Union actually had borders because they dont I believe that you should let free people actually make choices for themselves and stop being arbitrary about the fact that Costco Walmart and Target can be open but small Mom and Pops cannot If you dont want to come out stay home If you want  if you have a higher risk tolerance go out  I just think walking backwards on this is not helpful for anybody especially the people that are ready to be willing to go out and make a living and be customers  BRAZILE All right wear the masks folks Trust me youll look really good Its a sexy thing for the fourth Hey more of THE FIVE coming up Stay tuned  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BONGINO So weve all had to make adjustments in the era of COVID How does the Fox

thanks  And joining us now live from his office in the West Wing Vice President Mike Pence Mr Vice President welcome back to FOX News Sunday  MIKE PENCE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Morning Chris  WALLACE I want to start with those growing protests across the country against the stayathome orders Some of the protestors ignoring social distancing What do you think specifically of their protests and how theyre carrying them out  PENCE Well first let me say from the moment President Trump asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force two months ago he made it clear that we had one objective and that was to save lives And in the intervening two months the American people have stepped forward have embraced the social distancing have done the mitigation efforts And as we sit here this morning we continue to see encouraging results declining cases declining hospitalizations because of what the American people have done because of the presidents leadership and what governors have done around the country We are slowing the spread were hastening the day when we can put the coronavirus in the past and reopen the American economy  Beyond the focus on lives the president also made it clear that we wanted to ensure that our hospital workers incredible men and women had the resources and equipment that they needed Weve sent hundreds of millions of medical supplies to the critical areas around the country And I must tell you the fact that no American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator Its a great testament to our national response at every level  And on the subject of testing were continuing to scale and expand testing and will do that because as the president laid out those guidelines this week  no one wants to reopen America more than President Donald Trump And what you see I think among millions of Americans who have been embracing those social distancing measures and making the sacrifices is they want their governors to find a way to responsibly and safely reopen their state economies And what the president laid out last week is a framework  a phased framework to reopen America to do that and were going to work very closely with governors to implement that as soon as we can responsibly   WALLACE Vice President   PENCE  do it around the country ph  WALLACE  it  but Mr Vice President in a number of these cases these protestors who are not social distancing are saying they dont want to wait In many cases theyre protesting your own guidelines to stop the spread  On Friday the president tweeted this and I want to put it up Liberate Minnesota Liberate Michigan and Liberate Virginia and save your great 2nd Amendment It is under siege Washington Governor Inslee responded The president is fomenting domestic rebellion and spreading lies even while his own administration says the virus is real and deadly  So what does the president mean  because youve got guidelines that are calling for social distancing and staying at home Even your new guidelines to reopen the country are very phased and gradual What does the president mean when he says liberate these states  PENCE The American people know that no one in America wants to reopen this country more than President Donald Trump And on Thursday the president directed us to lay out guidelines for when and how states could responsibly do that And in the presidents tweets and public statements I can assure you hes going to continue to encourage governors to find ways to safely and responsibly let America go back to work  And the guidelines for opening up America again give a roadmap for doing just that Chris For states that have 14 days of consecutive declining cases that have proper hospitalization capacity we recommend that they   WALLACE Right  PENCE  can begin under phase one to ease the social distancing measures that have been put into effect allow some people to begin to come back to work allow some activities in the community to begin to happen And when the president speaks about reopening America its all about encouraging governors as soon as they determine as most proper and most appropriate to be able to do that and do that quickly  America works when America   WALLACE Mr Vice President   PENCE  is working and the president wants to see us put the coronavirus in the past by these strong measures the American people have embraced But we want to get America working again just as soon as we can  WALLACE Understood Mr Vice President I want to talk to you about your plan to reopen the country because there are a number of health experts that say that we need triple the number of tests that are now being conducted and much more contact tracing in order to safely reopen the government Can you tell us that  how soon that youre going to have 500000 tests a day which is what theyre calling for  were doing about 150000 now How soon are we going to have 500000 tests a day Or dont you think thats necessary  PENCE Well under the guidelines for opening up America again we create in phase one a specific criteria for testing that we believe is appropriate to be able to test people that have symptoms with ph coronavirus and be able to monitor people that are particularly vulnerable to serious outcomes nursing homes and particular populations in our cities that have shown some vulnerability  Thats  we believe the testing that we have today Chris across the country once we activate all of the labs that can do coronavirus testing is sufficient for any state in America to move into phase one Were doing about 150000 tests a day And you remember a month ago we had done 80000 tests total Now weve cleared 4 million overall But at 150000 tests a day  we think we can double that number by working with governors to activate all of the laboratories in their states around the country that can do coronavirus testing that would put us at roughly 300000  But what were going to make clear to governors again tomorrow in our weekly conference call  and I want to make clear to the American people is that President Trumps direction  were going to continue to fully partner with governors around the country and health officials in increasing and scaling the amount of testing And we have every confidence that we can have a sufficient amount of testing to be able to reopen America not just in phase one but continue in the weeks and months ahead to expand testing in ways that will give the American people the confidence and the tools to be able to go back to work  WALLACE Mr Vice President Ive got limited time with you so Im going to try to squeeze a few more questions in The 350 billion program to provide loans to small businesses has run out and you still dont have a deal on replenishing that with another 250 billion How close are you to a deal with the Democrats  PENCE The Paycheck Protection Program that the president signed into law has been an incredible success and literally has made it possible for small businesses around America to keep people on the payroll over a two month period of time while we weather the storm of the coronavirus But as the president and I were literally on a phone call with Republicans and Democrats last week we learned that the fund had run out and we are urging Democrats in the House and the Senate to step forward and approve an expansion of the Paycheck Protection Bill Were close Chris   WALLACE So briefly   PENCE  were encouraged   WALLACE  how close are you to it sir  PENCE The negotiations are going on Were very close but I think every American has seen the success of the presidents program to provide payroll support and were going to work to expand that so that no one working in a small business in America would have to worry about missing a paycheck during the trial and difficulty of the coronavirus epidemic  WALLACE Several sources now say that the coronavirus originated in a lab in Wuhan and that the Chinese government covered it up for some period of time which allowed the virus to spread Now Speaker Pelosi says while the president imposed his travel ban in January he didnt  he minimized the threat from the virus Here she is sir  BEGIN CLIP  REP NANCY PELOSI DCA SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Instead of calling it a hoax instead of calling it a  minimizing and say it ph was magically disappeared We lost time in delaying and the denial caused deaths and thats just the way it is  END CLIP  WALLACE Mr Vice President Im getting this question a lot and again Ive got to ask you for a brief answer What specifically is this administration going to do to hold China accountable  PENCE Well I appreciate you referencing the fact that by the end of January of this year President Trump took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China No American president had ever done that And theres no question all of our health experts agree that that bought us an invaluable amount of time to  its enabled us to save lives and make sure healthcare workers have the resources that they need to meet this moment  But it is clear to us that not only was there a failure by the World Health Organization to communicate to America and the world what was happening in China but also that China was not as forthcoming as they should have been with America or the world about what was happening   WALLACE So are we going   CROSSTALK  PENCE Well the presidents made it clear hes not happy He  were going to make proper inquiries into this at the proper time But I have to tell you the one mission that this president has given the White House Coronavirus Task Force is to save lives to put this coronavirus in the past Were going to stay focused on that mission Its one mission and one team Were going to work with governors across the country in both political parties  And I just want the American people to be encouraged by the fact that we are making progress We really do see downward trends in cases and in   WALLACE Right  PENCE  hospitalizations and we really believe that because of what the American people have done because of our incredible healthcare workers that we are together as a nation hastening the day when we will put the coronavirus in the past and get America working again  WALLACE Vice President Pence thank you Thanks for your time during a very busy period Please come back sir  PENCE Thank you Chris  WALLACE As we said the relief program meant to support small businesses run dry and leaders in Congress and the White House cant agree on how to replenish it Well ask House Speaker Nancy Pelosi what it will take to break the stalemate and provide more funds Thats next  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE Talks continue this weekend as congressional Democrats and the White House try to strike a deal to provide more money for a program meant help small businesses shut down by the coronavirus  Earlier I talked with the speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi about that and more  BEGIN VIDEOTAPE  WALLACE Speaker Pelosi good to talk to you again The 350 billion fund to provide loans to small businesses has run out President Trump says you and other Democrats are blocking a deal to provide another 250 billion Here he is on that  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP Nancy Pelosi shes away on vacation or something and she should come back She could come back and get this done I dont know why shes not coming back The fact is shes not doing her job  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE The president says he now supports your call for more money for hospitals but youre also calling for more money for first responders for food assistance for states and local governments  How long are you prepared to hold out Speaker  REP NANCY PELOSI DCA SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Well I think were on a very good path First of all I support the CARES Act Were very pleased to be able to turn it from a corporate trickle down bill to a workers first bubble up and support the PPP the Paycheck Protection Program in there  And so as they have committed the money that is there we want to add more money there It is very urgent though that we support our  our police and fire our healthcare workers our nurses our teachers and thats what the state and local government is about is meeting the needs of the coronavirus And everything that were doing is about the corona virus understand that Were not going afield on any other thing  And also to make sure that everyone has access to the  the program Im very pleased at the progress that is being made Weve worked in a very bipartisan way all along We continue to do so  We all pay tribute to our small businesses which are the optimism the entrepreneurial spirit of America and we dont want there to be any doubt that if they are participating in the program that they will be funded And if they meet those standards of the program that those loans will be forgiven  WALLACE So is there going to be a deal and if so how soon You know there are a lot of small businesses that are running out of money and are hanging on by their fingernails  PELOSI Yes and  and we want all of them to get what their entitled to under the  under the law and even more than were  some of these small businesses have other request in terms of the additional loan program in addition to this grant program and thats part of our request as well The money has not all been distributed although it has all been committed and thats  that means theres no more money They will have more money as soon as we come to an agreement which will be soon and I think people will be very pleased Because these small businesses must thrive in a community where theyre again health is essential to them opening up and they have to open up in order to fly  Its one thing to say to them today Its another thing to have customers at the end of the day  WALLACE The president announced a plan this week to reopen the country and you immediately criticized it I want to put up what you said  The White Houses vague and inconsistent document does nothing to make up for the presidents failure to listen to the scientists and produce and distribute  distribute national rapid testing  But Dr Anthony Fauci endorsed the plan take a look  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DR ANTHONY FAUCI DIRECTOR NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY  INFECTIOUS DISEASES If these things are done correctly what I believe they can we will have and there will be enough tests to allow us to take this country safely through phase one  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Dont you believe Dr Fauci  PELOSI Yes well he said if this were done properly Well it hasnt been done  On March 4th we passed our first bill bipartisan Testing Testing Testing Its over six weeks and it hasnt been done So hes saying if it is done properly Were already very late on that  But hes right it has to be testing It has to be tracing contact tracing It has to be treatment and it has to be quarantine Its part of something bigger as well to be done properly  But were way late on it and that is a failure The president gets an F a failure on the testing  But Fauci  Dr Faucis right If it is done properly it hasnt been and I  I think when he puts in the if its done is admission that it hasnt been done  WALLACE You as you are right now have been very critical of President Trump especially for what you say is the time that he lost initially in January and February in responding to the virus But I  I want to point out that on February 24th you went on a walking tour of Chinatown to try to promote tourism there and here is some of what you had to say  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  PELOSI Thats what were trying to do today is to say everything is fine here Come because precautions have been taken  We think its very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE If the president underplayed the threat in the early days Speaker Pelosi didnt you as well  PELOSI No What were trying to do is to end the discrimination the stigma that was going out against the AsianAmerican community In fact if you will look the record will show that our Chinatown has been a model of containing and  and preventing the virus  So Im confident in our folks there and thought it was necessary to offset some of the things that the president and others were saying about Asian Americans and making them a target A target of violence across the country  hate crimes   CROSSTALK  WALLACE But  but  forgive me dont you think  dont you think that you  you  when youre about walking without any mask I understand this is February not April when this happened and saying that theres no threat Its perfectly safe there  Werent you also adding to this perception that there wasnt such a threat generally  PELOSI No I was saying that you should not discriminate against  discriminate against ChineseAmericans as some in our administration were doing by the way they were labeling the flu and that no indeed And again I think you  if you check the record and its current you will see that our  that Chinatown has been a model in all of this  And so what were saying look to them for answers dont look to them to place blame  WALLACE As you know protests against the stayathome orders are growing across the country People are taking to the streets pushing back against some of the more stringent restrictions in some states  Can you understand why theyre doing that  PELOSI No not really Because what we have to do is  is  is shelter in place That is really the answer Testing tracing treatment shelter inplace and I do think that its unfortunate  but you know people will do what they do  But the fact is were all impatient We all want out but what theyre doing is really unfortunate because what is great though is the America  are the American people The American people know that the good health of themselves and their families and their loved ones is what is important and thats why you have seen such an overwhelming commitment to shelterin place distancing  people distancing  Because really it is the key to how we will open up our economy The health issue is the key to opening up the economy Unfortunately this  what you see there is you know theyre not ph respectful to whatever people think that they should say but the fact is this has to be sciencebased evidencebased databased and evidence and the science and the data says shelterinplace testing contact testing  tracing treatment quarantine is the answer to opening up our economy sooner  And I think by the way if I just may add I do think   WALLACE Sure  PELSOI  is a major distraction from testing testing testing  And so does it serve as a distraction Yes but thats not what this is about Were supposed to be focusing on getting over this so that we can open up our economy the sooner the better And Im proud of the American people   WALLACE Ive got a couple   CROSSTALK  PELOSI  because by in large they have embraced that  WALLACE A couple of questions I want to get in Just this week you called President Trump a weak person a poor leader Now I understand that he goes after you so this is fully a twoway street  PELOSI Yes  WALLACE But you think those kinds of partisan attacks by  in this case  you are constructive in the middle of a national crisis  PELOSI Well Ill tell you why it came to that I was so prayerful on Easter It was one of the first days I didnt have to be working every minute and I could reflect and be prayerful  And what I decided was that the presidents made many mistakes OK Lets have an after action review of that But if he continued to put forth proposals that were not sciencebased continuing his you know whatd he say its a hoax Its magically going to go away OK put that aside  But to  to proceed with policies which were not sciencebased which are not evidencebased and to blame others  blame anybody blame the governors blame me blame the World Health Organization Leaders leaders take responsibility  So I said hes a weak leader He doesnt take responsibility He places blames  blame on others and that might have been OK before but we cannot continue down a path that is again  Ill come back to science science science evidence data on how we should go forward  WALLACE Right  Finally and Ive got about a minute left here Speaker Pelosi When this crisis started you opposed the idea of Congress voting remotely Something it has never done before  PELOSI Yes  WALLACE But in the last week you have said you could support remote voting under certain circumstances What would you accept in that regard and why the change of mind  PELOSI Well it wasnt a change of mind it was that I tasked our chairs of jurisdiction Chairman Jim McGovern of Rules Committee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren of the House Administration Committee to say what are the options we can give members This was weeks ago What are the options we can give members  constitutionally securitywise and technologically  They came back this week with saying proxy voting is probably something that passes muster on those scores in terms of just for this purpose not for life in general but for this purpose And so that is  Im taking their recommendation It wasnt a change  my  my attitude was always if its possible lets see what the options are This is what they have come back and said is possible And well see  and it has to be bipartisan Well see how our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  I think theres some openness to it Youd have to ask them But we would want to do it in a  in a Congress Housewide not just a determination of the Democrats that thats the way we want to go forward We want to do it in a bipartisan way as we have done all of this  CHRIS WALLACE FOX ANCHOR Right  PELOSI Three bills in March All partisan  bipartisan not partisan at all and as this interim package will be bipartisan and want to keep the faith on both sides and with the public that this is  this is how we have to compromise We  we want to make improvements but we have to compromise to get the job done  And I might say Ive worked with the Republicans to pass the  keep government open until December to pass the USMexicoCanada trade agreement We  we dont get credit for where we do work together and I want to point that out  WALLACE Speaker Pelosi   PELOSI Again   WALLACE Credit where credit is due Criticism where criticism is due Thank you so much for coming and talking with us Please stay safe and please come back and talk to us  PELOSI Thank you  And credit to the American people for their patriotism and their concerns for their families Thank you  WALLACE Up next well bring in our Sunday group to discuss how and when to reopen the country  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE President Trump backs off his suggestion he has the authority to reopen the country even against the wishes of some states  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Let individual governors run individual states and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Well ask our Sunday panel how restarting the economy will work now  COMMERCIAL BREAK  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Governors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states Every state is very different  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE President Trump announcing new federal guidelines Thursday for reopening the economy saying its governors who will take the lead  And its time now for our Sunday group GOP strategist Karl Rove executive director of the Serve America PAC Marie Harf and the anchor of SPECIAL REPORT Bret Baier  Karl what do you think of the presidents plan as announced this week to reopen the economy and what about the concern that we dont have enough testing and contact tracing to do it  KARL ROVE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Yes Well first of all this fame  its not really a plan its a framework a road map I thought it was very wellcrafted It shows the president recognizing the differences between states and even the differences inside states It recognizes the primacy of governors and mayors in executing this making these decisions It relies clearly upon health experts and being drafted  Contrary to what Speaker Pelosi said this is clearly got the fingerprints of Dr Fauci Dr Birx all over it Im glad thats the case And it depends ultimately on three things lots of testing which unlike  you know Nancy Pelosi seems to think you can just click your fingers and theres going to be plenty of tests Its difficult having been in the White House when we were at SARS and MERS  or excuse me in H5N1 the testing that has to be done for this are  is difficult to organize difficult to create difficult to  to validate but its being done  It also requires that we continue our social distancing practices and its going to require a lot of prudent common sense steps by businesses as they begin to bring back employees and customers So I think its a good excellent road map Its going to take some time Were going to have to be  were going to have to be willing to accept that Even if a state does   meets all of these thresholds for all three phases   WALLACE Right  ROVE Were talking about six weeks before we can get areas of the country back to anything that looks sort of normal  WALLACE Marie a number of Democratic officials are saying that the president is moving too fast but to pick up on Karls point isnt that a hard case to make when this plan has been endorsed by Dr Fauci the kind of unchallenged expert on all this and especially when you see growing restiveness and frustration with the stayathome orders and the economic consequences of that  MARIE HARF FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR There are a number of independent medical experts who have been very clear publicly that we do not have enough testing yet And that until we do pushing to reopen to early will just result in more outbreaks in places we thought we had it contained So when you see some of these protests that you talked to your previous guests about in places like Michigan in places like Ohio theyre not social distancing They are promoting reopening the economy while ignoring all of these national guidelines And so each of these governors have huge responsibilities right now to  to message to their citizens in a way that convinces them that these are in place for their own good to help protect them and their families  But the bottom line Chris is that there are very few indices in this country that can actually get the number of tests we need that can bring together industry that can use the Defense Production Act to get the tests we need which right now have plateaued And thats the federal government So thats one place we actually do need a little more action is getting more testing and getting industry around doing that  WALLACE President Trump got into fights with governors this week over everything from who has responsibility for more testing to the question of who has responsibility for ending the lockdowns And some of the governors fought back Take a look  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES If we came into this room today and said the battle is over we have won its 100 percent gone the Democrats would say the president has done a horrible job  GOV ANDREW CUOMO DNY If hes sitting home watching TV maybe he should get up and go to work right  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Bret the president often ended up in a less controversial place like when he eventually said its up to governors to open up their own states at the pace they choose But he sometimes took a circuitous route to get there  BRET BAIER FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR Chris you know I covered and wrote about President Eisenhower the 34th president and he used to say words matter and less is more The 45th president takes a much different communication style He thinks more is more as evidenced by these press briefings And his supporters will tell you that words matter less if  I said last week if President Obama had said that he had total authority to tell the states when to open that conservatives heads would have exploded Well two days later when the president said the governors will make the call if Obama had done that turnabout conservatives heads would have exploded too  But the bottom line is that its the actions and its Dr Birx and Dr Fauci and Dr Redfield up on that podium with the president signing off on this not flicking the switch but nuanced rollout of guidelines for states So its the actions not the words his supporters will tell you But clearly the communications style frustrates a lot of people and maybe independents  WALLACE Karl let me pick up on that because theres no question when the president says he has the authority total authority to decide to open up states or when he talks about liberating Minnesota it creates a controversy But in the end to Brets point does that really matter or is the  is the real importance here going to be where we end up both in a public health sense and in an economic sense  ROVE I think thats right Its going to be whats the result of this Do we think that at the end of this that the American people think look we came through this thing about as well as could be expected Nobodys got a sense that everything has to be perfect Nobody has the sense that oh you know we  we  we dont have enough testing and we can solve that problem tomorrow by invoking the  the Defense Production Act Theres no need to do that because every business every pharmaceutical company every testing company that wants to be involved and can be involved is involved in this  But youre right at the end of the day its going to be what are the end results of this  WALLACE Yes And look its governed by these  you know the Stafford Act the you know Public Health Emergency Act the Disaster Act of 1974 and clearly every one of those acts to some degree looks for a balance in our federalist system between the president and the  and the  and the federal government and states and local governments And some there are more authorities for states and  and  and some more for the federal government  But we live in a federalist system and they got to  they got to deal with that  WALLACE All right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back President Trump and Joe Biden trade shots in the midst of the coronavirus over whos been too soft on China  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE Everyone knew they lied about the virus China President Trump gave China his trust  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES President Xi I think theyre doing a very good job  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE A global crisis President Trump took action but Joe Biden attacked Trump after the China travel ban  JOE BIDEN D PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE Xenophobia and fearmongering  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE Political ads for both Joe Biden and President Trump now focusing on the others record on China in the midst of the global pandemic The website attacking the former vice president called Beijing Biden  And were back now with the panel  Bret obviously things can change dramatically between now and November but are the  the health crisis and the economic crisis such an overwhelming event  overwhelming substantive event and political event that this is likely November to be a political referendum on how President Trump is handled it  BAIER One hundred percent I think its the election And Ill quote a  a very wellknown anchor who said just that about a week and a half ago Chris Wallace I think it comes down to how we get out of it and how the president handles this But you know you put on the intro there the China part And I think thats going to be a big part of the election how China is used not only  and you can see this by the Biden campaign putting out a foreign policy advisor Tony Blinken pointing to President Trumps comments about China being positive  But there are about 80 percent according to the internal polls cited by The New York Times of the public who believe that China really covered up at the beginning US officials are convinced thats the case Its not conclusive that it came from this lab accidentally or otherwise yet but they are convinced that China really covered up at the beginning and thats going to be a big focus of this  The fascinating part Chris was the question to Nancy Pelosi about her walk in Chinatown on February 24th February 19th there was a Democratic debate in Las Vegas Three words werent sad virus coronavirus or Covid19 Never came up  WALLACE Well to throw a bouquet back at you obviously China becoming a bigger issue after your reporting this week about as some sources told you the biggest political coverup in history by China about its role in the virus  Karl let me switch subjects to you  Joe Biden theres asymmetric warfare here because Joe Biden is stuck in the basement TV studio in his home in Delaware If you were advising him how would you tell him to try to strike a higher profile or would you say thats a mistake at this point Look everybodys focused on the virus just let the stage to the president  ROVE Well youve got to recognize there are limitations because youre right the president dominates this This is a time where no matter what he does hes going to  Biden is not going to have the profile of the president  I would say three things First of all dont pick a  dont pick a fight over China If the question of this election is whos tougher on China Donald Trump is the answer not Joe Biden  Second of all I would not follow the practice of Nancy Pelosi which Joe Biden is unfortunately following and that is just to pick at the administration and say defense  youre not using the Defense Production Act Da da da Da da da Da da da Thats  you know look hes quickly and shes quickly becoming what Bill Sapphire ph once called nattering nabobs of negativism  To me one of the things that would be important is for Joe Biden to  if he wants to contrast with the president to herald the actions of these Democratic governors like Cuomo and Newsom and others who are getting very high marks in their states for managing this well  And thirdly the third piece is I would be focused on what it is that would be necessary to convince people in the fall that Joe Biden ought to replace Donald Trump And thats not the moment of the immediate controversy Its sharing a broader and bigger vision as a traditional Democrat And he aint doing that He is going  continuing to go hard  march hard to the left And I think if he keeps doing that by the time we get to August and September those small group of swing voters are going to  are going to be forced with the issue do I want to keep Donald Trump in office after I voted Democrat for Congress in 2018 or do I want to go with a guy who seems to see  seems to be like Bernie Sanders only not so much Bernie Sanders I mean thats not a particularly good choice to  for those independents to make if youre Joe Biden  WALLACE All right let  Ive heard from the Republican strategist about what Joe Biden should do Lets hear now from the Democratic strategist about what Joe Biden should do Hes  hes obviously  doesnt have the platform the president has How critical should he be and how much should he try to struggle for a stage and attention hes just not going to get it at point  HARF President Trumps platform is a little bit of a doubleedged sword though because he does have the power of the bully pulpit and the White House Briefing Room every single day But some of the things hes said are literally writing their own attack ads When President Trump stood up there and said I take no responsibility when he promised we would all be able to get a test if we wanted one Donald Trump talks a lot as Bret mentioned earlier and  and those are writing their own ads for the Democrats right now  Joe Bidens whole theory of the case has been a return to normalcy and competence That was before the crisis That was his theory for why he should be the nominee and why he can beat Donald Trump That is even more of his theory of the case now that he is running a someone who can bring normalcy back to this country and confidence back And overwhelmingly polling shows thats what people want  people want in this election And you know he will continue doing cable Chris He will continue doing virtual fundraisers But that fundamental question come November is where Joe Biden thinks he can bring Democrats and independents and some disaffected Republicans along with him  WALLACE Bret to Maries point the White House Briefing Room can be a doubleedged sword As weve seen some cases it shows the president in charge I  I think its fair to say that the rollout of the phases and the gating that was  you know the very gradual reopening of the country was well received on Thursday But some of the things the president has said over the last couple of weeks have gotten him in trouble And in fact youve seen a bit of a dip in public approval for the president even with these long national briefings  BAIER Well thats true And there are all kinds of different you know questions that  of all different flavors that come up and sometimes the president is out there longer than his supporters and aides would like him to be But hes running this show And it just  how we get out of it  most importantly how the economy recovers Twentytwo million Americans filing for unemployment Small businesses one in four saying theyre teetering on closing or closing This is massive Its a nuclear bomb in the US economy  So theres the health side but the economic side is as important of how we crawl out of this  WALLACE And when you talk about people wanting those briefings to be shorter as the anchor of SPECIAL REPORT which is usually on at 600 pm Eastern when the briefings are happening I suspect sometimes youre looking at your watch  BAIER Were  were ready either way Were ready either way Last  yesterday  or I  the other day I had 22 minutes So that was great  WALLACE Well thats a very good answer but I should say because I know your staff is working hard to do an entire hour show and they dont always get to put it on the air you should put it somewhere so we can all see it  Thank you panel See you next Sunday  Up next our Power Player of the Week top chef Jose Andres on another rescue mission This time its not a

period Thats about one month One month is a long time  END VIDEO CLIP  NEIL CAVUTO FOX NEWS ANCHOR Stay at home Just stay a little longer How about two weeks longer  Welcome everybody Im Neil Cavuto and this is YOUR WORLD  The governor of New York leading a halfdozen other Northeastern states saying were not ready to go back to everything as normal at the end of this month Try the middle of next month and we will get back to you on that  This as the president has been talking about with governors all across the country all 50 of them what is a right time to start unwinding the process that has got roughly nine out of 10 of us sort of locked at home or not venturing too far from home  What happens right now especially as states differ on whos ready and whos ready for what In the case of New York City the mayor raising with Bill Hemmer not too long ago the possibility that the citys pools and beaches could be closed for the summer Were talking the summer  So where are we going with all of this  John Roberts at the White House following how the president is sort of ironing all of this out and finding some compatibility with the nations governors  John  JOHN ROBERTS FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Well lets hope hes finding some compatibility Neil  Hes been on the phone with them for the past hour It started about 300 Last time we checked the president was still on the phone with them going over his new opening up America again guidelines that will be released at 600 tonight  This is real specific medicallybased data that hes providing to the governors so that they can formulate a plan to open up the country From the 30000foot level heres what we know about the plan It will be governorled It will be datadriven and layered on a  basically a  dont know what that number is there for  Itll be datadriven and layered specifically tailored state by state and  really we can get rid of that Im not talking about that  Itll be datadriven and layered not a cookiecutter onesizefitsall type of policy Some governors will continue their shelterinplace policies others will open sooner  We are told that the  there we go  We are told that the presidents chief medical advisers Dr Robert Redfield of the CDC Dr Tony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx have all signed off on these guidelines all three agreeing that this is the way forward  At a briefing last night the president indicated that this will be a rolling opening Listen here  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES You already know we will be opening up states some states much sooner than others And we think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1  And I think that that will be a very exciting time indeed Governors are looking forward Theyre champing at the bit to get going Again not all states are the same  END VIDEO CLIP  ROBERTS So what do governors think of the plan  Ned Lamont of Connecticut speaking to this before he got on the call with the president Listen here  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GOV NED LAMONT DCT As you said these are guidelines Of course we will listen see what he has to say see what Dr Fauci Dr Birx recommend Whats a testing protocol that makes sense How do we share data  Then at the end of the day though every state is a little different and every governor will make up their own mind how to proceed  END VIDEO CLIP  ROBERTS Now in announcing the guidelines tonight President Trump will also salute those who have been on the front lines helping the United States make its way through this crisis the doctors the nurses the first responders the politicians on a state and local level the businesses that have stepped up to the plate to really keep things moving treat these patients  The president just a little while ago on the South Lawn paying tribute to the nations truckers who have kept the wheels rolling all through this bringing in muchneeded medical supplies food and other items Listen to what the president said  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP To every trucker listening over the radio or behind the wheel I know I speak for the 330 millionplus Americans that we say thank God for truckers That will be our theme thank God for truckers  END VIDEO CLIP  ROBERTS The president also had teleconferences with members of his new Opening Up America Again congressional group 32 members of the House 65 members of the Senate  The big topic of conversation in those teleconferences Neil was the fact that the small business association 350 sic pool for paycheck protection has run out and Congress still has not passed anything to replenish it  There is a bill in Congress for 250 billion for more paycheck protection funds but thats stuck And the president is trying to get that push through  Neil  CAVUTO You know John Im curious  Has the president commented to anyone about the timing of the governors announcement at least the Northeastern ones led by Governor Cuomo to push this back to the middle of May so close to this phone call  ROBERTS Yes  And the one thing I got from the White House this afternoon when I was read in again on the 30000foot level on this plan is that this is going to be datadriven not datedriven  So while there are probably some states in the nation that could open up tomorrow and if not tomorrow certainly before the April 30 guidelines expire but for other places like New York City in particular probably like Detroit like New Orleans it may be some time before they can begin to get back to normal  But thats the way that the president is looking at this It is not going to be like flipping a switch Itll be slowly turning up a dimmer if you will on the country and it will take some time before everything is back to normal  CAVUTO All right John Roberts at the White House  All of this occurs at a time we got news today that jobless claims soared in the latest week more than 52 million Americans applying for firsttime jobless benefits here but all of this at a time in the last four weeks we have seen about 225 million Americans file for these claims  So a delay of any sort and getting back to business as usual or de sheltering some of these plans obviously risks those numbers getting still higher  But that will be the rule right now in the New York area along with the states of New Jersey Connecticut Delaware Rhode Island Pennsylvania Massachusetts all right now pushing back any talk of easing up on sheltering at home until at least May 15 in other words another month of that  Lets get the read from David Lee Miller in New York with the very latest   David Lee  DAVID LEE MILLER FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Thats right Neil  We heard from Governor Andrew Cuomo today saying that he is going to extend until May 15 now the shutdown of these nonessential businesses in New York state citing the fact that the social distancing and other measures that have been put in place are working to slow the virus  The governor said hes making this decision in coordination with seven other Northeastern states But interestingly those states do have varying policies about how they want to restart the economy In the last 24 hours here in New York 606 fatalities were reported That is down significantly from the 752 the day before  The governor said we have to continue what were doing And he made his case citing statistics on the rate of infection  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  CUOMO No political decisions no emotional decisions Data and science Were talking about human lives here  END VIDEO CLIP  MILLER The governor also urged New Yorkers to abide by his executive order requiring anyone who was in a situation where social distancing cannot be practiced to use a face covering  And at a nursing home in Andover Township New Jersey authorities say acting on a tip they found 17 bodies in a small morgue Some of the remains were relocated to a refrigeration truck that had been set up nearby  The mayor says he has heard unconfirmed reports of as many as 76 deaths at this 700bed facility It is not clear how many people at that home died from the virus but the governor is now asking his attorney general to investigate  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GOV PHIL MURPHY DNJ I am heartbroken by the tragic news that several individuals have lost their lives in a coronavirus outbreak at the Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center I  II and pray for the health and recovery of the other residents  END VIDEO CLIP  MILLER And in New Jersey at least 3156 people have lost their lives in total to the coronavirus The curve there is on the rise  Governor Cuomo said today that he is going to help out a neighbor and New York will be sending 100 ventilators across the Hudson to New Jersey  Neil  CAVUTO David Lee Miller thank you very much my friend  So you know what those states are battling and how theyre trying to balance the need to economically get back on track with some of the real medical issues that David Lee just spelled out  How do you go about that  Lets ask Nicole Saphier that  Doctor I mean obviously theyre wrestling with a number of issues Many of these states have already imposed statewide you have to wear a mask a medical mask a face mask  So theyre already kneedeep in that So it does make a little sense why would they suddenly reverse that go back to business as normal in just a couple of weeks But by pushing it to May 15 what did you think of that  DR NICOLE SAPHIER FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Well Neil thats a great question  And to be honest I have mixed feelings about it On one hand I  I want to get things open again I think that there are longterm consequences to mental and physical health by keeping things shut down  I think were seeing an increase in depression and anxiety Its really unfortunate Also I want to be  on the other side I want to make sure Im keeping everybody safe from this novel coronavirus  I hate hearing stories that you have 17 people 17 bodies piled up in a nursing home in New Jersey I mean it is shocking and very tragic  But heres the thing Neil We need to have a very smart and balanced plan of how were going to open things back up Saying everyones going to be at a stayathome order in this area until midMay thats really disconcerting to me  I was really hoping that we could take this on a daybyday weekbyweek basis Right now we just saw the first singleday drop in deaths in New York And that is extremely encouraging That doesnt mean that we should open up everything tomorrow But to push it off now for a month from today essentially to me that seems a little hasty  I understand that theyre executing extreme caution here But I do think that theres a smart way to begin slowly opening things up And I really hope that is not so discouraging to people to hear that midMay date because I think that that potential bad news that was given today could really have an effect on peoples mental health  And I dont like that I really would prefer to take this a little bit slower and maybe look at things on a weekbyweek basis and not be pushing things out You keep seeing these titles on media articles saying that New York beaches may be closed throughout the entire summer  I mean thats something people look forward to all year round We cant be doing that right now We have to continue to encourage people telling them that the social distancing measures are working were having fewer new cases fewer hospitalizations and fewer ICUs  And now we just saw the single first day drop in deaths I mean those are all great things to talk about We have to focus on that And I would  I would much prefer that we looked at this more on a daybyday or weekby week basis and not be putting out these longterm estimates  CAVUTO All right we will watch what happens  Right now these states are the only ones that have extended it to the degree they have But we will be keeping a close eye on others and if they follow Doctor  Thank you very very much Dr Saphier  Again you hear about this rolling recovery this rolling getting back to work the sort of staggered schedule to sort of push you out of your home and see if its  its time to go back to work  For many people thats going to be confusing very confusing  Stay with us  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO You know pushing back these stayathome provisions for another couple of weeks now one more month of this for a lot of folks well thats got pretty exasperating written all over it particularly in places like Michigan that might feel the same way We dont know yet  But you might recall that the governor there Whitmer had imposed even stricter stayathome provisions yesterday that triggered protests and traffic jams that extending to at least three other states where there are pretty tough stayathome provisions  A lot of folks in these states are saying Enough already This is getting out of control We want to go back to work We want to protect those who are in danger We want to protect to make sure that this doesnt get worse but come on already  Scott Walker is the former governor of Wisconsin He joins us right now  Governor what do you make of these provisions particularly  and I should lead off first with what is going on in Michigan where the governor there took what were pretty stern measures and made them even tougher In other words you cant buy a motorboat You can buy a canoe  SCOTT WALKER R FORMER WISCONSIN GOVERNOR Yes  CAVUTO If you have a vacation home in the state you cant see it and on and on And they just said enough  What do you make of this  WALKER Well for all the people talking about you need to look at the data and the facts theyre just ignoring that in a big power grab  And I think this is what has made people increasingly frustrated with whats going on all across the country Michigan probably being the tip of the spear  I mean the fact that youre going to go fishing youre going to be in a canoe to me actually being out in the water is the ultimate social distancing You wave to your neighbors when theyre on the boat but you dont have to be up close to them  Why would you take away these opportunities that dont put anyone at risk But this is what happens when people get powerhungry and theyre taking actions that far exceed their constitutional rights  CAVUTO You know its always a balance between protecting the public health and protecting the public economy And I get that Governor  But do you fear that Republicans leading this charge to go back  Im not saying its monolithically Republicans by the way  that if something happens  WALKER Right  CAVUTO  if theres a sudden spike in cases theyre going to look like they were too too busy to rushed to get business going and not looking after the public welfare What do you think  WALKER No I think you have got to balance both And thats where the balance comes in  We have got to fight the war against the coronavirus and win If we engage too quickly were only going to hurt ourselves later with the economy if we got to go back and repeat some of these measures over and over again That would be an absolute catastrophe both for the health of our fellow citizens and the health of the American economy  But we have got to have a plan to do both We can be first and foremost looking out for fighting the coronavirus providing all the assets we need to deal with this health and medical issue At the same time we have got to be able to walk and chew gum and start planning for how we restore the health of the American economy  To me  I have written about this for weeks in The Washington Times that you cant just wake up the day after and say oh by the way now were going to reopen the economy Theres got to be a plan including things like fixing the unemployment system which unfortunately they broke at the federal level when they provided disincentives for people to go back to work once it is safe  CAVUTO What I wonder about is  we will eventually get to the point Governor that this will end hopefully prayerfully without any spike in cases et cetera but it will be slow right  I mean a lot of these states are going to maintain distancing measures and the like But youre familiar in Wisconsin a lot of buildings and workplaces that are very very crowded People are packed close together  And Im wondering if as many people come back to work even when theyre allowed to come back to work because theyre going to have to be spread out  WALKER Well a couple of things  Again you got to have a game plan Today unfortunately the new governor here extended the stayathome order to almost the end of May so almost a monthandahalf from now To me we should look at the next two weeks  Our peak in Wisconsin was weeks ago at the beginning of April It was 198 new cases that day The average this week has been about 127 according to data from the Wisconsin Hospital Association  Were not out of the woods yet but we need to look at the data My hope is that we will continue to get better over the next few weeks and then have a game plan I dont think you just open it up all at once  Maybe some of the viewers dont remember this but I remember years ago when I was a kid playing sports if the lights went off at the stadium then you turned them on and it took a while to come back on  Thats what the economy is going to be like Theres going to have to be a phasein I think we start with manufacturing and the trades Those are areas where you physically have to be there and where you can spread people out  You can close down break rooms and lunchrooms and keep people at their  at their actual machinery at their site You can do other things to make sure people arent huddled together and keep those offices where there are cubicles and administrative duties going on Keep them at home longer  Theres a logical way to do this But we have got to have a game plan Most leaders most governors and mayors arent talking about that around the country We need to have a game plan And we need to be doing it now not waiting until whatever day is the artificial endpoint and then waking up and wondering why the economy doesnt come back  And as I mentioned we also got to do it Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott laid this out weeks ago We have got to fix unemployment I think theres a way that you can encourage people to go back to work keep them whole for the higher amount theyre getting  A guy making 10 an hour right now under the new system here in Wisconsin he would be making 400 a week if he was working Hes going to make about 800 a little bit over 800 with this new federal enhancement  But I say let him go back to work when its safe but do so in a way that puts an incentive on going back to work and doesnt provide a disincentive for work along the way  We have got to handle those things now  CAVUTO All right  WALKER  and not wake up weeks from now and try and fix it  CAVUTO We shall see  Governor thank you very much for taking the time  By the way to the governors point here this is a global issue folks The United Kingdom theyre going to keep their very strict measures in effect for at least another few weeks  Germany that has had a big improvement and a swing in things back to business as usual or close to it come next week Kids go back to school the week after that  Its different strokes for different folks no matter where you live on Mother Earth  Stay with us  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right this is a staggering number to look at 22plus million Americans who have lost their jobs over the last four weeks filed unemployment claims better than 525 million in the latest period  And its a trend that has not been well the working man and womans friend  Steve Moore former economic adviser to the president of the United States very close confidant to him widely respected writer on all things financial  Steve the longer this goes on whether its medically necessary or not I mean the economic pain is palpable and real So with states a number of them now delaying these changing or revising these athome rules do you worry numbers like that claims like that get worse  STEPHEN MOORE FORMER DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER Yes I do  I told the president exactly that in our first meeting of the new economic task force that hes appointed And I think he more than anybody in the White House wants to get this economy up and running  And that was before we saw these horrific numbers today that show 22 million people unemployed Neil thats not  thats something I never thought Id see in my lifetime  And so I think that has maybe created a little bit of a tipping point here I think Americans are starting to see the kind of carnage that is created when you shut down a 20 trillion economy  I think youre going to start to see some states as early as next week Neil starting to open states like Arizona states like Nebraska that are going to say hey we can do this in a smart way and keep our citizens safe and not put them all on unemployment lines  CAVUTO Do you worry though that this pretty much kicks in the can the notion of a Vshaped recovery though that with so many states on staggered schedules likely to your point that were not all going to ride like a rocket on this back  MOORE No its going to be a slowrolling kind of wave where youre going to start to see these  these red states frankly the more Republican states  I just listened to your discussion with Governor Walker  Wisconsin may be a lagging state and Michigan By the way your mayor there in New York is now saying what that New York City might not open up until after the Fourth of July I mean thats crazy  By the way you do that New York City is no longer to be the financial center of the country Its going to  its going to move somewhere else and Times Square May as well  So youre going to see a  but theres probably no way around that Neil because we do believe in federalism The president said that yesterday that this has to be led by the states I think he will reiterate that later today when he has his press conference  The White House is going to provide the guidance The states are going to make the decisions  But Im with you I think if these states across the country like California and New York and Illinois which are big important states economically if they dont open up its going to really slow down the rapid kind of expansion that Vshaped recovery that we all want to see  CAVUTO But what about if theres a spike in cases  No matter how you stagger this or try to get back I mean theres probably going to be a spike of some sort in cases right How do you balance that  MOORE Thats the  thats the decision that the president has to make  Its got to be one of the hardest decisions any president has made in modern times You want to keep the American people as safe as possible As the vice president and the president have said saving lives comes first  But when you see 22 million people in unemployment lines and you see those pictures of whats happening in Pittsburgh with people standing in line a milelong to get to the food banks people are really suffering out there  And the left tries to make this as lives vs the economy but you have to do both We dont have a society if we dont have an economy that is producing things and good  like goods and services  And I do think that finally the American people are starting to say wait a minute yes we want to remain safe yes we want to remain healthy but theres got to be a way to do this keeping people safe and healthy but getting people back on the job and these businesses up and running because if we dont this goes back to your initial question to me Neil  What happens if we dont open up the economy soon And if we dont open the economy until the middle of June as sort of the governor of Virginia is saying you can pretty much wipe out the entire year of 2020  And its going to be a brutal recovery I think a lot of Americans think oh as soon as this is over we will just go outside and we will go back to our jobs and everything will be back to normal  No its going to take a number of months to get back anywhere near normalcy  CAVUTO We shall see  Steve Moore thank you very very much  Then theres the issue of China and what it knew and when it knew it and how closely it was working with the World Health Organization or not working  Enter Jeff Sessions You remember him He weighs in  after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right youre looking to live in Connecticut right now Hartford Connecticut  Governor Ned Lamont is going to outline and will outline exactly why he and six other governors in the Northeast have decided were going to be doing this athome thing another month  after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO Forget about what China knew and when Where did this whole COVID 19 thing start and how  A lot of folks are confused  Jennifer Griffin our Pentagon correspondent with more  Jennifer  JENNIFER GRIFFIN FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT Neil for the past three days the defense secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs have been asked about the origins of COVID19  They have said repeatedly the intelligence picture is not complete  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MARK ESPER US DEFENSE SECRETARY The results are inconclusive if you will  We do know one thing If the Chinese government the party had been more transparent earlier it would have helped us A majority of the views right now is that it is natural that it was organic  END VIDEO CLIP  GRIFFIN The choice of the word natural is by design meaning the current intelligence suggests it either occurred naturally in a Wuhan market the seafood market there transferred from a bad or a pangolin a type of anteater to human beings or it may have been part of legitimate research the Chinese have been doing in their Wuhan labs on how coronaviruses naturally spread from bats to people research the US at times has even funded  If it originated in a lab it is believed it left the lab accidentally perhaps a researcher unwittingly who was contaminated and spread the virus into the community  US national security officials have been clear this was not a manmade bioweapon The US has done genomic testing on the virus and ruled out that possibility  Last week the Pentagons top doctor ruled out China unleashed the bioweapon on the world  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GRIFFIN Do you have any new information or any suspicion that this COVID 19 may have been the result of a bioweapon  BRIG GEN PAUL FRIEDRICHS JOINT STAFF SURGEON Im not worried about this as a bioweapon  END VIDEO CLIP  GRIFFIN Bottom line is its still too early to say where this virus came from It did begin in Wuhan China And the Chinese have not been forthcoming about what they know or when they knew it  Neil  CAVUTO All right Jennifer thank you very very much  So forget about what the Chinese knew  What did the World Health Organization know about any of this Already the president has promised to cut our funding to the World Health Organization to get to the bottom of this and cozy ties that he deems are too cozy  Jeff Sessions joins us right now the presidents former attorney general now a candidate to retake his old Senate seat in Alabama  General Senator I dont know which to call you but I will  very happy to have you  What do you make of the World Health Organization and this investigation into what they knew and how close they were to China Effectively were saying that they  the Chinese were lying and that the World Health Organization knew it What do you think  JEFF SESSIONS FORMER US ATTORNEY GENERAL Well I think we absolutely need to inquire into that We spend a tremendous amount of money that the president is suspending that go to the World Health Organization  Did they know Well what did they know We know that in midJanuary they announced that it was not transmittable from person to person That was one of the greatest errors in the history I guess of modern medicine  It was absolutely false It lulled the world into a false sense of security And Id like to know did the Chinese tell them that Did they ask questions about that Did they get it in writing How was it that they told the world falsely that it was not transmittable  And they need to answer that Its important for the entire world no doubt about it  We know this that doctors in China on January 1 were warning of the transmissibility of this wear  encouraging people to wear protective clothing and were shut down by the Communist Party were told not to tell the truth about it had to sign a statement recanting their testimony were even jailed  CAVUTO All right so they  they  if youre right  if youre right Senator then they did  they did  they did hoodwink people  But it appears they hoodwinked your old boss the president because back in January he had said specifically of the Chinese The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and their transparency It will all work out well I want to thank President Xi  So was President Trump duped  SESSIONS Well I dont think duped is the word for it  He had no way to study what went on in China He apparently took the word of what they were telling him  CAVUTO Well apparently he got  he did get a headsup He did get a headsup Senator from Peter Navarro right He did get a headsup that this could be a worry this virus could be a big worry right  SESSIONS Well he did get a headsup  Peter Navarro argued the case But youre saying at that point Im not sure that he had any basis to conclude China was flatly lying And he  so he had to make a decision about how to respond to the Chinese leader And he did  But he did quickly recover and was attacked by the World Health Organization for actually stopping travel from China to the United States That was a colossal error by Dr Tedros and the World Health Organization  They clearly took Chinas side improperly and attacked improperly the president of the United States  CAVUTO But do you think were so focused on whether the World Health Organization was cozying up to China  And by the way it did have a long history of unusually close ties with China even ignoring advances that the Taiwanese were giving them and warnings they were giving them but that theres a lot of blame to go around here  I mean I get the impression sometimes Senator that the administration points fingers at these organizations and other organizations and just doesnt say hey we all botch things we all miss things Its only human Its not a sin  But theres enough blame to go around And right now the focus should be on beating this thing Theres plenty of time for investigations and taking peoples budgets away But is now the time to do that  SESSIONS Well its a suspending of the budget and a call for a form  and transparency which is absolutely important  I do not believe China needs to get away with this again In the past consistently when caught in wrongdoing they just denied it And when you challenge it they deny it again they deny it again and deny it again until people give up and go away  CAVUTO Right  SESSIONS In this deal I think the world needs to know with conclusive proof what did they tell the WHO what did they tell the world and was it true or not  Didnt they know at least is as early as January 1 that this was a transmissible disease And now the world has suffered incalculable loss  CAVUTO So you think there was  yes I understand You think there was plenty  you think there was plenty out there  Real quick  Id like to leave you on this note  have you and the president talked I know you left  last time we talked it was a little tense to put it mildly He even disputed the way youre using his name in political ads and the rest He is supporting your primary opponent the former Auburn University football coach  But have you talked to each other Have you made amends Or is it just still chilly  SESSIONS We have not made a conversation and talked about it  I would just say this I remain very supportive of him and his agenda I have defended him because hes been faithful to what he promised and hes been highly effective in achieving things for America  Would love to be a part of the United States Senate And we can continue to battle with him for the great principles that I think are important for the future of the republic  I do believe that we need to stand up on this China matter I think we need to straighten up the World Health Organization I have no doubt about that  CAVUTO All right  SESSIONS And hes a strong person Hes willing to do it  And I dont think that we need to say we cant walk and chew gum at the same time I think we can active  investigate this problem at the same time we respond to the pandemic I dont think its the wrong thing to do I think we need to get busy about it right now  FOX has really produced some new evidence that  CAVUTO All right  SESSIONS And more proof that it came out of the lab maybe instead of the wet market Thats a dramatic development Thats what I have thought the facts were before  CAVUTO We shall see We shall see  CROSSTALK  SESSIONS  confirmed  CAVUTO All right  All right Jeff Sessions thank you very much for joining us  By the way we did reach out to the senators primary opponent and the incumbent Alabama senator We have not heard back But hope springs eternal  Stay with us  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right the well has run dry  The 360 billion set aside in the Paycheck Protection Program to help businesses get back on track its already tapped out And the extra 250 billion that Republicans are leading a charge to add on to that well thats kind of in limbo  Mike Emanuel with the latest from Capitol Hill  Hey Mike  MIKE EMANUEL FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT Neil good afternoon  The Small Business Administration says it essentially handed out 14 years worth of loans in less than 14 days Check out the numbers 350 billion exhausted more than 16 million approved loans nearly 5000 lenders participating  This afternoon Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to bring up a 250 billion extension of the program once again and it was blocked  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  SEN MITCH MCCONNELL RKY Its absolutely surreal to see Democratic leaders treat support for workers and small businesses as something they need to be goaded goaded into supporting  This really should be above politics  END VIDEO CLIP  EMANUEL Staff members of the top Democrats in Congress Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have been negotiating with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin trying to get some other priorities included with small business funding  BEGIN AUDIO CLIP  REP NANCY PELOSI DCA They need the money We understand that And were willing to give them that money But we also need the other money  And why  the question is not why are we not just saying lets just do that and forget about hospitals state and local The question is of the Republicans why are you ignoring your state  END AUDIO CLIP  EMANUEL Leader McConnell notes he has been telling his lawmaker colleagues this program for small businesses has been running out of cash and now it has  Neil  CAVUTO All right Mike thank you very much Mike Emanuel on Capitol Hill  Well you have heard about these 1200 checks and all the rest Maybe you got yours Maybe you didnt Hang in there  How about a 2000 check and not just a onetime event How about every month  The congressman who wants to do that and get that going  after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right maybe you have gotten your 1200 stimulus or coronavirus relief check maybe a little bit more Maybe youre still waiting  But now a gentleman he was a presidential candidate a congressman from Ohio who is saying you know what we can do a lot better than that and we can provide a lot more help than that  his proposal a 2000 check every month for virtually every American  I dont know about every American but I want to get the details from him Congressman Tim Ryan with us right now  Congressman good to have you  Is it every American or could you detail who gets those checks  REP TIM RYAN DOH If you make 130000 or less as an individual you will get it 260000 per couple you will get it Everybody over the age of 16 will get it  And so this is going to hit every American that needs it right now The anxiety is deep We need the wage continuity Neil thats going to be able to help these families They didnt do anything wrong but the bottom fell out  And I just think a onetime 1200 shot which is  is welcome and people are thankful for it isnt nearly enough to help people  CAVUTO All right but that sounds like a lot of money I havent even added it all up How much would that be  LAUGHTER  RYAN Well its going to be you know into the trillions of dollars  But when you look at the hole in the economy the tens of trillions of dollars that were missing now 70 percent of our economy is consumer driven And so we have to get money in the consumers hands  Now this is not just for the short term Neil where were saying look we want to help you with your mortgage and all of these other issues that people are having now because theyre not working And they didnt do anything wrong  But if we want to go from an Lshaped recovery to a Vshaped recovery we have got to make sure that people arent behind on their mortgage behind on their car payments behind on their bills And that way they will be solid And then if we want to  as we unravel this thing that we will be able to have consumers out there with money in their pocket that can start going to the restaurants and spending the money  So if we want a Vshaped recovery were going to need to make sure that people are stable and have some dough in their pockets And thats exactly what this does And it gets rid of all of these  the conversations about the bureaucracy and the this and the that and how do you  how do you shove 2 trillion through a garden hose  Direct cash payments to the American people to stabilize their lives I dont think thats too much to ask  CAVUTO Well its a lot of money  But having said that I understand where youre coming from Congressman But how long would it last How long would these checks keep coming  RYAN Well I mean first of all Neil I mean when we did the tax cuts a few years ago that was 23 trillion in money that was all borrowed  And so no one was talking about where are we going to get the money for these tax cuts  CAVUTO Well this will be borrowed too This will be borrowed too  RYAN Well its  well everything is going to  CROSSTALK  CAVUTO I guess what I want to know is how long it would go on is what Im saying  RYAN Well in Congressman Ro Khanna and our  and my legislation this will go until we get the unemployment rate back to precoronavirus levels  And again this is an aspiration I think this is something that needs to happen until we can get the economy moving  But Neil we get calls all the time I mean people are struggling out there This is very very difficult The mental health issues are going up The physical health issues obviously are going up People are working longer hours The grocery worker the truck driver these people need some help  And its always OK  if the big dogs need some help they always seem to get it And when are we going to help the person on the ground thats making the country move right now that are in very risky situations  Its time for us to help the cop the firefighter the retail worker thats out at the local grocery store Its their turn  CAVUTO No I  I can see Congressman where youre coming from  But many in your party have blocked this additional 250 billion in aid to help the Paycheck Protection Program which seems to have met huge demand essentially capped out today  RYAN Yes  CAVUTO Wouldnt the immediate need right now be replenish that because a lot of folks are depending on it  RYAN I am 1000 percent supportive of us getting these small businesses their money  Im getting calls every day from friends of mine who own restaurants and different facilities that they need help And Im supportive of it  But at the same time Im also getting a lot of calls from my mayors city council people township trustees Their general revenues are bottoming out So we cant just help the small business people and then tell the public sector that their revenues are down and they wont have enough money to hire police and fire  Whos going to go tell the police officers and the firefighters that we got to lay you off now in the middle of a global pandemic and we cant pick up trash and do the basic services that are needed  Those people need help too And theres really  were borrowing money like crazy here Why would we not want to help these locals who certainly cant get it themselves I dont know what the holdup is here  CAVUTO All right  RYAN We got to get both parties together to agree on that Thats  this is simple This is not complicated  CAVUTO We shall see  Congressman thank you very much Good seeing you again Be well Be healthy  We will have much more after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right the president says ultimately its up to the governors  But were hearing among his ideas is a threephase approach that would start with reopening theaters and restaurants and large venue settings again with social distancing in effect and then get to the schools and maybe nonessential travel  That tips it off Much more to come  Here comes The Five "},

{"4472": "NEIL CAVUTO FOX NEWS ANCHOR Thank you Bill very much  Well you have to walk or should I say CityWalk before you can run Im talking about CityWalk at Universal Orlando which is officially reopening as we speak Now this is not the theme park at Universal This is pretty much a lot of the restaurants a jobs in and around it as the slow unwinding of provisions begins  Again no rides but plenty of good eats  The read right now from Phil Keating following it all from Miami  Hey Phil  PHIL KEATING FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Good afternoon Neil  As of this upcoming Monday the entire state of Florida will be in reopening phase one That means retail restaurants salons barbershops can all be open again at 25 or 50 percent capacity  But in Orlando today as you mentioned Universal CityWalk the retail and restaurants at least some of them reopening now to people to come spend some money Disney World is doing the same next week for its very similar setup called Disney Springs  As for when all of Floridas famous theme parks will open SeaWorld Universal Disney World no firm dates yet But I can say Disney World is taking reservations for the month of July  Up in Hollywood Florida residents are clearly happy that the Broadwalk along the beach there is now open again for three hours of morning exercise and fresh air Today was day two and notably many not wearing masks  Around the country most states now have lifted coronavirus shutdown restrictions at least partially 43 states by our count and by next Wednesday it will be 46 states  We asked Americans across the country how they feel about gradually getting the economy and life back towards normal  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE Yes it should open you know How can everybody survive on nothing  UNIDENTIFIED MALE We are in danger of turning ourselves into prisoners in our own country  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE As long as they control the crowds in there so its not people on top of people that would make me feel a little bit better about it  UNIDENTIFIED MALE The inconsistent way at which the stayathome order has been administered is ridiculous It changes from town to town It changes from county to county It changes for crying out loud in Chicago from building to building  END VIDEO CLIP  KEATING Now several national polls have dealt with this over the past week or two asking Americans how comfortable they feel about getting things reopened again including groups larger than 10 people and perhaps smallsized crowds  Well a majority of Americans in every single one of those polls feels that reopening the economy and life in general now may be a little too soon and too quickly  Neil  CAVUTO All right Phil Keating thank you very very much Phil Keating in Florida  I want to switch right now to New Jersey where the beaches will be open at least by Memorial Day  Governor Phil Murphy surprising a lot of New Jersey residents with that news Now just because the beaches are open there are still limitations and crowd control and distancing measures and all the like and restaurants as of yet not part of that mix here  But eventually the thought is that they will be  Lets get the very very latest right now from Alex Hogan who has more on the big reopening  Alex  ALEX HOGAN FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Hi Neil  So as you mentioned New Jersey beaches will reopen but the beach itself wont feel the same The governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy announcing that all beaches in New Jersey will be opened by Memorial Day with Cape Mays beach doing a dry run this weekend  But the beach itself will feel different So for starters fewer people will get to go to the beach at once Groups will have to stay at least six feet apart from each other There will be no special events like activities on the boardwalk no playgrounds or arcades  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GOV PHIL MURPHY DNJ Organized games and contact sports will be prohibited as will beach recreational summer camps and special events that draw people to the beach such as concerts festivals or fireworks  END VIDEO CLIP  HOGAN The Sea Isle City mayor calls COVID19 just another storm that beach towns need to face together like they have in the past  Hurricane Sandy beach reconstruction cause debates over the economic impact of closing beaches According to the state record high tourism to the Jersey Shore last year brought in 464 billion  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MAYOR LEONARD DESIDERIO RNJ SEA ISLE CITY It is fabulous news about the beaches I know that in Cape May and in particular in Sea Isle they are now waving to me with five fingers  END VIDEO CLIP  HOGAN And here in New York we are seeing people walking long the water but theres no sign that the beaches here in New York will open anytime soon  The mayor saying that of course theres a lot of factors to take into consideration not only the safety of people but also the economic impact of bringing in people to enforce social distancing  So if people here do want to go to beaches anytime soon it looks like the only way theyre going to be able to do that is to cross the Hudson and go to the Jersey Shore  Neil  CAVUTO All right thank you very much Alex in the middle of that  By the way nearby New York by the way is opening up as well but in stages and mostly for Upstate New York  We got word from Governor Andrew Cuomo that the plan at least initially is to expand manufacturing construction industry services largely in the socalled Upstate region That would include cities like Rochester Utica also Binghamton New York less affected by the hardhit cases that had hit the New York metropolitan area  We will be getting details on that shortly But again the goal is within the next few days to begin that process in the hardesthit states That is New York New York and New Jersey accounting for the first and second largest number of cases of coronavirus in the United States And then there is Ohio a state that has quickly become the model for how you first get into this and now how you first get out of it  Governor Mike DeWine joins us right now on the latest plans now to include eventually reopening child care facilities and a lot more  Governor very good to have you back  GOV MIKE DEWINE ROH Good to be back Thank you  CAVUTO Whats the latest Governor  DEWINE Well I just announced a few minutes ago child care opening up on the 29th  Were doing it in a very very careful way with reduced number of kids per teacher fewer kids in each room So we want parents to be able to feel that they can be safe But we also certainly want the workers teachers to be safe as well so very very very important  CAVUTO So whats the rollout  I know it started by doing this sort of tiptoeing into the water a little bit What has already resumed or even partially resumed Whats the plan now for the next few days and weeks  DEWINE Well I think I was off a date I think the 31st is actually the date that were going to do child care So I apologize for that  CAVUTO OK Thats fine  DEWINE Tomorrow people will be able to get their hair cut So I know theres going to be a lot people are happy about that tomorrow  LAUGHTER  DEWINE So its been a while for me as you can tell  CAVUTO Well thats good Thats a big thing Thats a big thing other  salons and everything  But what was the method to decide what opened first how much it would open capacity issues How did that all get decided  DEWINE We put together a working group for every single profession every single type  type of business category of business  And it was a combination of people who were involved in health who are the experts but also people who are the experts on their business or their  or their profession  For example hair we had people who had single shops We had people who had multiple shops We had people who do nails Put them on  in a group together and say come up with the best practices  And the good thing was Neil there was really very little dispute between the health people on the group and the people who were running the business or the professions They all came to an agreement  We put those best practices out We said look if youre going to open back up this is what you have to do  So when someone walks in to get their hair cut tomorrow theyre going to know that who is ever cutting their hair is following the best practices that we know of that can  that can take place and keep people as safe as is possible  So we went about it in a careful way We have also kind of layered this We havent  didnt do everything at once We have spread it out over a fewweek period of time  But as you and I have talked we still are obviously concerned One of the things I said to Ohioans today at my press conference is its now more important than ever that you keep the social distance that you  if youre out in public wear a mask  These are things that are very very important because were opening up the economy We know theres more contact People are moving around more So the risk goes up And so the caution must go up at the same time  CAVUTO So let me ask you what about the school situation Governor  And are they out for the rest of the year Maybe you can update me even your plans for the fall whether everything will reopen  DEWINE Yes Schools  CAVUTO Can you update me  DEWINE Schools are closed  I mean theyre  school is still going on Were doing remote learning But the physical buildings are closed  CAVUTO Right  DEWINE Theyre closed for the academic year  We have not made any decision about the fall In Ohio some of our schools open midAugust We certainly hope that were able to open  I was asked that question today at the press conference and one of the things I said was this virus is very very unpredictable We dont know exactly where we are  But the schools are making plans to be open What I have asked them to do is to come up with different alternatives and come up with the best practices they can come up with in regard to social distancing and sanitation  And theyre all working very very hard on that And we will just have to see We certainly hope to be back open in the fall  CAVUTO Youre probably aware Dr Anthony Fauci had expressed some reservations about the rush to get kids back in the fall  That got him a little zing back from the president of the United States today who said he disagrees with that and then that he didnt understand where that came from He said since so few are young you know kids or even schoolaged kids off to collegeage kids it didnt seem necessary  What are your thoughts  DEWINE Well I understand where the presidents coming from  Look we all want to get back to normal We all want the kids to get the best education they can get So I fully understand that  The reason that schools  I think we were the first state to close schools and other states did that as well But the reason the health professionals tell you that you need to do that is not so much that youre worried directly about those kids but that this is a great place to spread it  And so take a class of 25 kids 26 kids and theyre all from different families and they come in and one of them is not showing any signs no temperature or anything but we know many people who have this dont show the signs And that child then spreads it to 25 other kids  You go back to 25 families  CAVUTO Right  DEWINE And so its a great  its a huge multiplier  And its the same concern frankly we had about child care And thats why we have been so very careful as we rolled out child care So were trying to do it We  look we know we cant stay closed down forever We got to get the economy moving  But we got to be very very careful as we do it I mean we dont want to   yesterday on the news  you reported it  you had countries in Europe who are now going backwards I mean basically they have shut down  CAVUTO Right  DEWINE Then they opened up And now theyre going back  I mean thats not where we want to be And so we have got to be very very careful We have got to watch our numbers every single day Im looking at traffic counts in Ohio Its something Ohio Department of Transportation does all the time anyway  So I see them And the traffic is going up I mean people are getting back out And thats OK as long as people understand the risk now goes up because youre out more And you just have to be even more careful than you were before  CAVUTO Yes I like that you do that and remind people well whatever we giveth here can be taken away if you screw this up  DEWINE Dont want it but yes  CAVUTO I think that was your message there  So  DEWINE Yes  CAVUTO I hear you  Governor Mike DeWine thank you very much  DEWINE Well I mean what were seeing in Europe we dont want to see  CAVUTO Go ahead  DEWINE Thank you very much Good to be with you Neil Thank you  CAVUTO No youre right about that  Speaking of which that was Governor Mike DeWine of the beautiful state of Ohio really providing the guideposts here not only how you shut a state down in the face of this ahead of everybody but how you unwind all of that  And he was mentioning where we had these spikes in cases in Russia and India a sudden new spike We heard reports as well in Spain an unexpected jump in cases nothing alarming but enough right now where its giving some countries pause about an unwinding process that now and then can surprise you  For the governor they dont want any of those surprises  In the meantime we are focusing on the president wrapping up a tour of the Pennsylvania medical supply company a little earlier This company is providing everything from masks to gloves and all of that  Were going to talk to Owens  Minor CEO Ed Pesicka on what came of this visit and why it captured and he captured the presidents attention  Stay with us Youre watching Your World  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right the president made a point to visit an Allentown Pennsylvania medical supply company that churns out everything from medical masks to gloves to hospital gowns you name it  The president there to thank the workers for doing it  Right now we have Jacqui Heinrich on the importance of that trip and why this particular company  Jacqui  JACQUI HEINRICH FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Well Neil President Trump thanked workers and criticized the Obama administration for leaving behind a depleted National Stockpile  The president announced a number of efforts to replenish the stockpile including an executive order directing the International Development Finance Corporation to assist key industries  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES My goal is to produce everything America needs for ourselves and then export to the world And that includes medicines  The federal agency normally invest in economic development projects in other countries I said how about investing in our country  END VIDEO CLIP  HEINRICH The visit comes amid a broader push to loosen coronavirus restrictions and jumpstart the economy  Trumps feud with Democratic governors extended to Pennsylvania earlier this week when he tweeted Pennsylvanians want their freedom  He urged Governor Tom Wolf again today to reopen parts of the state Nearly half of Pennsylvania remains under restrictions not meeting benchmarks set by epidemiologists  A protest tomorrow is expected to draw crowds similar to the hundreds who rallied in Harrisburg last month Meantime former Vice President Joe Biden criticized Trumps visit accusing him of trying to divide Americans over safety and the economy  This afternoon he hosted roundtable events discussing the pandemic with former rival Michael Bloomberg and possible VP candidate Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer  An April FOX News poll showed Pennsylvania voters prefer Biden in a head tohead matchup with Trump with six in 10 saying the Trump administration was too slow to act on coronavirus  Trump won Pennsylvania by less than a percentage point in 2016 just 44000 votes Todays visit neighbors one of the three counties that flipped to support him last cycle  Neil  CAVUTO Jacqui thank you very very much  Speaking of Jacqui was just mentioning the Owens  Minor CEO of the company that the president visited today will be joining me shortly on this broadcast So stay tuned for that  I mentioned we had a big surge on Wall Street at the end of the day some more dovish comments or optimistic comments from the chairman of the Federal Reserve but also deal talk that might be in the works  Here on that is Charlie Gasparino  Hey Charlie  CHARLIE GASPARINO FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT Its like we moved the markets on Cavuto your FOX Business News FOX Business show when we started talking about deal talks and particularly as they relate to banks  I mean banks have taken the pandemics lockdowns pretty hard Bank shares have been off lately Deals that involve mergers often  thats often a selfcorrecting  correcting mechanism for companies that are under financial distress  Goldman Sachs is the name we hear And Goldmans had a rough year even rougher lately given whats going on in the markets What we understand is that theres lots of chatter out there from bankers Neil that Goldman Sachs is going to find a merger partner possibly a big bank  The names we keep hearing is PNC Bank which recently sold out its stake in BlackRock the big money management firm So clearly it could be looking for something else to do  Another firm is Wells Fargo as you know the bank in LA been in a lot of trouble lately over their phony accounts scandal Looking to jumpstart itself So that name has been in the mix as well  US Bancorp has always been in the mix with Goldman From what I understand Goldman Sachs officials have looked at that deal They have walked in the past And one of the reasons why they walked in the past is because of management issues Who would control it  Usually when Goldman Sachs engages in these talks Neil one are the main reasons why they break down is because Goldman wants to run the show but they dont have the size anymore to run the show The banks are  that they are looking to team with are bigger and their management wants to run the combined entity  So thats where it breaks down But theres no doubt in the market right now theres a lot of smoke about Goldman Sachs teaming up with some  with another player It helped the markets because Goldman Sachs is a widely held stock It helped financials because people think there could be dealmaking  And usually dealmaking leads to higher stock prices  CAVUTO Right Right  GASPARINO And thats why you had the surge not long after we reported it around noonish today on Cavuto Coast to Coast  Neil back to you  CAVUTO All right so you would have to have gotten FOX Business to appreciate that which you hope people do have right  CROSSTALK  GASPARINO Well they did appreciate it so that means people are watching us  CAVUTO All right there you go You got it There you go watching you my friend  Charlie Gasparino on that  All right well we know right now that a lot of people want to know exactly what some higherups in the Obama administration all the way up to President Obama himself why they were so interested in unmasking a certain individual  Were beginning to put it all together  after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right well someone has some explaining to do maybe lots of someone at the Obama White House in the final days of that administration  At least thats the way Senator Chuck Grassley sees it when he was talking about the unmasking that itself has to be unmasked  Chuck Grassley  BEGIN VIDEOTAPE  SEN CHARLES GRASSLEY RIA We do know that there was a meeting took place on January 5 at the White House that all these people including Biden were involved and Obama involved and that there was a leak to the press and the leak to the press on January the 12th was a criminal act  And we need to pursue all these facts how  if  I hope Graham does have a hearing And if he has a hearing Im going to be there participating  But in the meantime I have got my investigative team in the Finance Committee working on this full time And were going to follow these facts to where they lead us  But for sure we need to know what Obama and Biden knew and when did they know it And we also need to know when it comes to this unmasking of American citizens names that are supposed to never be disclosed because of constitutional protection most of that unmasking is done within the intelligence community because they know what else they need to know about an American citizen maybe working for a foreign government  But its very curious that at the highest political levels of the president of the United States that theyre involved with the unmasking And thats a  thats a real issue We got to get to the bottom of it Is it for intelligence purposes or is it for political purposes  And three years of digging into this I have come to the conclusion its more for political purposes And for Democrats right today that are saying were doing this for political reasons I want to remind them that Senator Feinstein the Democrat of California and I sent a letter to the Justice Department February of 2017 asking for the transcripts of the ambassador Russian ambassador talking to Flynn  And we still  we didnt get them now and were asking for them again  So this is something I have been working on that had nothing to do with the pandemic So I take very personal the fact that somehow we are just being political because this is a political year and because Bidens involved in this  CAVUTO Real quickly on that Senator James Clapper Brennan as well saying we didnt know who this American individual was talking to the Russians we had wanted the unmasking to find out and that this was routine  I think Clapper had said this was all very routine and then there was not a sort of this cabal effort to undermine the future president  Do you buy that at face value  GRASSLEY No  And I buy it for a different reason a different reason He could be saying that sincerely but you have got to connect that to the fact that he lied on television time after time about Russian involvement and he didnt know of any intent of the  for political reasons to get involved in that  And then when he testifies before the committees under oath he says he didnt have any intelligence whatsoever that connected him that would tell him that we had anything to worry about  CAVUTO So does this go potentially all the way up to President Obama at the time  GRASSLEY Well I wish I could answer your question And Im not avoiding it I just dont know yet at this time  CAVUTO Sure  GRASSLEY Except for the meeting on January the 5th and then Biden and other people like Samantha Power and Susan Rice being very close to the president being involved in this It looks suspicious  But I wish I could tell you yes or no and I cant  END VIDEOTAPE  CAVUTO All right we might have not clarified the real newsmaking element in that interview  It started out with Chuck Grassley saying that he was not going to tell Lindsey Graham to call President Obama as a witness as President Trump had recommended but he said it would  it would probably be a good idea  Now Im going to raise this with Ken Starr the former Whitewater independent counsel FOX News contributor more importantly to us  Ken the issue started with Grassley of course the head of that very committee Lindsey Graham runs now that would be responsible to try to take this to the next level if they do and to call Barack Obama as a witness to that committee  How likely do you think that is  KEN STARR FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR It is all dependent Neil on the facts  And you build your case a step at a time gather the facts assess the facts And then if the facts point to the president  and we know about the January 5 meeting  then there is a compelling need to get his testimony to hear what he has to say about it  You would do it through an interview So its a little too soon to tell But certainly it is in the realm of possibility bordering on likelihood because there was this huge flurry of interest in this Kislyak communication with an American  By the way poor General Flynn not only in light of whats been happening on the legal front but we now know that essentially he was cleared at the lower levels of the FBI after a fivemonth investigation into whether he had connections with the Russians  And by this time remember he was the designated national security adviser to the incoming president of the United States Its all very odd  CAVUTO So Ken whats odd to me is so many administration officials very highup officials as I said to the vice president at the time seeking this unmasking in other words not knowing ostensibly who the person was who was having these discussions with the Russian ambassador but trying to find out who that would be leading to obviously General Flynn  But does it seem odd to you that either that many either didnt know or were trying simultaneously to find out and get to them  STARR It is odd to me that so many people were trying to find out through their own resources as opposed to allowing the intelligence community the appropriate people to say hey to piece all these things together we in the intelligence community need an unmasking  But why did the chief of staff to the president of the United States need to unmask Why did Vice President Biden need to unmask Theres been no explanation for that And so one of the reasons I would frankly be suspicious right now is the failure of memory of person after person Samantha Power others who just said well I just dont remember  And you just cant accept that at face value Amnesia on the part of Washington DC senior officials occurs much too frequently and much too conveniently  CAVUTO You know Democrats have come back largely  I think Im getting the gist of their argument Ken  to say this is meant to focus more on the investigators rather than the investigated  And its sort of like a shell game that the White House is playing now to take the attention off of the investigation itself What did you make of that  STARR Well but the investigation itself has proved to have been fruitless and feckless  It should not have continued on into January it being the investigation into General Flynn Thats the underlying investigation  CROSSTALK  CAVUTO So the fact that they were relentless at it  I just want to understand  The fact that they were relentless at it Ken catches your attention that they didnt just drop it This was something that was in wave after wave higherup after higherup correct  STARR Thats correct  It is so odd that you had so many people and at increasingly high levels Again it raises a lot of I think very serious questions We dont have the answers to them But it is very good reason to be suspicious  CAVUTO All right  STARR And Senator Grassley is right in asking these questions  All right Ken Starr thank you very very much my friend Good seeing you  Again theres been no indication certainly out of President Obamas office whether he would even entertain being called to a committee  The president of the United States Donald Trump has said that he would recommend it  We will have more after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO Think quick Orlando Universal and Seaside Heights New Jersey what do they have in common  They are slowly reopening Im not talking the theme park at Universal but pretty much everything else And Im not talking all beaches right now but in a couple of weeks  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right the president back in Washington DC right now after paying a visit to Allentown Pennsylvania  He was visiting Owens  Minor Its a company thats making all these face mask gloves hospital gowns Got the presidents attention certainly  The CEO of that company Ed Pesicka joins us right now the big cheese at Owens  Minor  Ed very good to have you  How was it there today with the president  EDWARD PESICKA CEO OWENS  MINOR Ill tell you Neil it was great  And it was great for our teammates here Our teammates at this facility have been working 247 really since back in February along with all the other teammates at our distribution centers  So just to put it in perspective since February we have distributed over three billion units of PPE across the United States through our distribution facilities In addition to that it was another honor to have him here to recognize our manufacturing teammates that have been working 247 also since February to increase production of N95s of our masks our iso gowns  So extremely proud of our teammates and extremely happy for the president to come here and recognize them  CAVUTO Ed how did you get the presidents attention Obviously putting out numbers like that will do it  But there are a lot of facilities around the country doing  certainly not at the speed and volume you are but doing what youre doing But you did catch his attention How did that happen  PESICKA You know I think its really just anywhere we have been possible to partner with our customers as well as with the US government during this pandemic we have been open and continue to try to answer that call with the increased production  So I think thats a big part of it is just our approach to what we have   how we have handled the situation  CAVUTO Did the discussion ever come up now with all of this stuff you guys are churning out and have churned out like a central warehouse for it all  Because in some cases you have produced far more than is certainly needed right now Now God forbid its needed down the road that youre accommodating that but like a central medical supply warehouse or station  PESICKA I think thats what the medical distribution companies do Its actually the ability to store that product properly rotate it so it doesnt expire and then get it out to the customers when they need it  That was part of the tour today We displayed what one day of PPE looks like at a major hospital in addition to that our ability to pick hundreds of lines per person per hour at any unit of measure that the customer wants  So I think the value of medical distribution is really what was appropriate today and what we talked about  CAVUTO How did the whole mask thing get settled Some were wearing  I saw in one case you were not the president was not Others were  Could you update me How was that decided How was that handled  PESICKA So our policy is we all  the entire  all Owens  Minor teammates wore masks we work gloves during the entire process  Thats what we do from an organization to keep our teammates safe We have instituted that back in early February And we  to keep our teammates safe we wear gloves we wear masks as well as do temperature check  I tell you the other nice thing about a 200000squarefoot warehouse is it enables us to social distance during our production And if you saw on TV we were social distancing even in the audience with six feet between everybody  CAVUTO But I didnt see the president wearing a mask I dont know if that was just did he ask Did you suggest Or how did that  how did that go  PESICKA Yes  The president elected not to And during the entire tour he social distanced  CAVUTO OK  PESICKA  from everyone during the process So we made sure of  that happened And thats how it worked today  CAVUTO All right Ed thank you very much  Good for you Ed Pesicka the Owens  Minor CEO Had a big event that got the president out of Washington today to let the workers there know he appreciates what they are doing  Real quick peek at the corner of Wall and Broad today in case I did not mention it a little earlier but did want to remind you we were down as much as 400 points for a while on the Dow finishing at almost the exact reversal of that on talk that right now things look good for banks that maybe people got a little ahead of themselves yesterday  Its a snapshot Its one day It does not trend make but for today more green than red  Stay with us  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right there are guidelines and there are guidelines  When the CDC issues them when it comes to what we look for to get states to reopen they get a lot of attention especially when John Roberts gets ahold of them  John what are you finding out  LAUGHTER  JOHN ROBERTS FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Now this is something that we expected to come from the CDC today And its just out now on the Web site  Its a little bit difficult to navigate to But what it basically is is its a group of decision trees here for everything from schools to businesses and what they need to do in open  in order to open safely  And theres a lot of commonality here between all of these Lets look at the school one here first promote healthy hygiene practices handwashing employees wearing a face covering if possible intensify cleaning and disinfection  And then there comes down to some specific guidelines like encourage social distancing in schools through increased spacing small groups limited mixing between groups if feasible  Lets put up the next graphic which is workplaces You can see that what changes there is when you come down to encouraging social distancing its enhancing spacing between employees through physical barriers changing layout of workspaces encouraging telework closing or limiting access to communal spacings staggering shifts and breaks limiting large events where feasible  A lot of commonality between these and also some specificity as well So basically what you do is you go  you start at the left and you go through the decision tree If you dont have all of those satisfied then you dont open you go back you remitigate  But if you proceed to yes then you go to the next phase proceed to yes and go to the next phase after that then you can open  The president here as you see coming down the stairs at Joint Base Andrews after being in Allentown Pennsylvania at a company that is helping to replenish the National Stockpile of protective equipment  The president should be back to the White House in about 15 for 20 minutes or so  One of the things that the president did this morning on his way out was he gave us a very big tease Neil as to something coming on vaccines tomorrow I have discovered that what the president is going to announce tomorrow officially is a publicprivate partnership a real Manhattan Projectstyle of thing  It really involves the private sector and the Department of Defense to develop a vaccine We know the players who are going to be involved in that Neil What we have not gotten yet is the official rollout of that and that will come tomorrow  So some new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control today tomorrow the rollout of this new vaccine initiative  One thing I should point out though is that these decision trees that the CDC has put out on their Web site theyre very difficult to find So if you go to my Twitter feed you can find some direct links to them  Also it does not include some of the guidelines we talked about yesterday which were more stringent than the guidelines that the White House had put out For example the White House says you can resume nonessential business travel in phase two The CDC wanted to hold that to phase three So that hasnt changed  But they do have these new decision trees here to help you go through the process of getting ready to reopen  Neil  CAVUTO Thank you my friend very much John Roberts in Washington  ROBERTS You bet  CAVUTO By the way a number of officials are saying were trying to get out of this but it could take a while to get through this  The World Health Organization says forget about this resurfacing and a bigger problem into next year Now theyre saying for many years  What  After this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DR RICK BRIGHT FORMER DIRECTOR BIOMEDICAL ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY We need to ramp up production of essential equipment and supplies including raw materials and critical components  Shortages of these increase the risk of our frontline health care workers and they deserve the best equipment to protect themselves We need to facilitate equitable distribution of essential equipment and supplies  And finally we need a national testing strategy  ALEX AZAR US HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY This is like somebody who was in choir and is now trying to say he was a soloist back then  What he was saying is what every single member of this administration and the president was saying We need more personal protective equipment We need more ventilators We need therapeutics We need vaccines  Every single thing this president was on this president achieved  END VIDEO CLIP  CAVUTO All right the administration not taking too kindly to that whistleblower Dr Rick Bright as to whether the administration has done enough continues to do enough to have the necessary equipment in place if this were to drag on  The indications from the doctor were that it will drag on  This on the same day we learned from the World Health Organization that this could be a problem forget about the rest of this year to next year like forever which really rattled a lot of folks  Dr Nicole Saphier with us right now Make America Healthy Again the bestselling book of course more importantly to us a FOX News contributor  Doctor what do you make of what this whistleblower is saying now what the World Health Organization is warning Thats sort of like a double damning statement there What do you make of it  DR NICOLE SAPHIER FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Well Neil so we have to think about some of the things that Dr Bright mentioned  He said that he wanted more virus samples earlier on and he also sounded alarm that we needed more PPE Theres a really easy way to refute these charges in the sense that all the administration has to do is just prove that there was a broader interagency effort to secure some of this  And we know that they were It wasnt  it wasnt part of BARDA which is what Dr Bright is director of Thats a very small area within the N  or within HHS  So when it comes to PPE and the virus samples yes well let me tell you the common denominator there That is China And China is notorious into keeping information during global pandemics like they did here And they werent doing virus sampling in the beginning  Yes they gave us the genetic sequencing but we needed virus sampling And it wasnt until the end of January that Australia was able to identify the virus in one of their infected citizens  But at that point over five million people had already left Wuhan China which is why we saw so many cases of this virus across the world  And then in terms of PPE well yes the National Stockpile was deficient in PPE But guess what We also have a supply problem Neil because 50 percent of our PPE ventilators a lot of the medications or  is actually manufactured in China  So thats the common denominator here And again I appreciate what he is saying that he needed these things in the beginning But I have to tell him that Im pretty sure that there was a larger broader effort also demanding these things  We know President Trump has a tendency to just pick up the phone like he did He said that he actually was communicating with the president of China to try and get the virus samples And he was actually trying to get more PPE He invoked the Defense Production Act midMarch  So we know that there were other efforts to do this that maybe Dr Bright wasnt privy to in his limited role at BARDA  CAVUTO Now the issue is whether we have a lot of this stuff now because if anything when it comes to expanded equipment the ventilators and masks and gloves and all this stuff now we have more than enough it would seem  So whatever people should have known or done back when no matter whos saying that its more than made up for now Or do I have something wrong  SAPHIER No of course  We have more than enough We saw that Were actually reshipping ventilators throughout different areas of the country  But I will tell you Id rather have 100 too many than one too few And at this point we have  CAVUTO Right  SAPHIER We have more than we need And thats wonderful  The one thing that Dr Bright did bring up was hes concerned that there is a shortage on syringes and needles that we will need if we do get a successful vaccine in the future But we already heard earlier this week during the testimony from the doctors that they have already secured different contracts to make sure that we have hundreds of millions of these in case that we do find a safe and effective vaccine in the future  So these are already being worked on I mean yes I do appreciate what he is saying  CAVUTO All right  SAPHIER But I dont know if this constitutes a whistleblower complaint  I will be honest It seemed like there was actually a lot of emotion in some of the complaints I did read all 63 pages of it But I have seen a larger broader effort from the administration on securing some of these items that he said that no one was listening to  CAVUTO All right Doctor Yes it does seem a slightly different tune  Thank you very much Doctor  We will have more after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right word that the human beings are coming back to the New York Stock Exchange  Were told that the Big Board is partially reopening trading with those floor traders because up to now its been all computerized But bit by bit beginning the day after Memorial Day the human beings return to help with the computers  There is

{"4018": " condemns generals who plan to fight the last war rather than anticipate the challenges ahead Effective leaders strive to get in front of the problem In his Rose Garden news conference Friday outlining the federal government’s next steps to get in front of the advancing   pandemic President Trump was much more forwardlooking than his critics In battling an epidemic the primary goal of public health officials is to slow the spread of disease to protect vulnerable populations If they do not slow the spread medical treatment facilities can be quickly overwhelmed leading to delay or outright denial of care for many The travel bans established by the president aim to slow the entry of the coronavirus into the US The social distancing policies being implemented by state and local governments private organizations and individuals aim to slow the spread within the country These actions have been largely successful to date Our hospitals and intensive care units are not packed much less turning away patients Yet the president has been harshly criticized by some for not doing more Most of the criticism has focused on testing issues – and some of it is legitimate But testing is no silver bullet for stopping the disease COVID19 which is caused by the coronavirus Right now Job 1 remains slowing the spread of the disease and protecting vulnerable populations That will see us through the remainder of the flu season buying time for better therapeutics and vaccines and yes better testing All of that will minimize severe sickness and deaths So what does the president’s Rose Garden declaration of a national emergency do to advance the fight against COVID19 Basically it makes a lot of useful federal assets available to state and local governments These governments bear the bulk of the responsibility for halting the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in our communities and dealing with its consequences In reality there is no single declaration that constitutes a national emergency There are well over 100 emergency executive powers that presidents may invoke What Trump did was fashion a package of powers that will give states and communities what they need most For starters the president evoked emergency authority to remove some restrictive red tape in the Medicare and Medicaid programs This will quicken and expand access to medical services For example patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid will now be able to take advantage of telemedicine letting physicians do online or telephonic consultations and screenings without requiring patients to leave their homes and sit in crowded waiting rooms President Trump also created new options for private sector initiatives including better testing In addition the president invoked the Stafford Act one of the most commonly used sources of emergency authority This act is usually used in responding to natural disasters like hurricanes and floods The Stafford Act was invoked most recently when tornadoes hit Tennessee But some of its provisions can be useful in pandemic response – for example in delivering federal aid and financial support to affected communities Declaring a national emergency is not a signal that it’s time to panic Rather it is a clear signal that the federal government will fulfill its role in responding to a crisis And that role is to complement and reinforce state efforts – not to supplant them By invoking the Stafford Act the president has given state and Native American tribal leaders greater access to the resources managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency – from personnel experienced in complex response to funds for building temporary facilities emergency shelters bottled water rations and much more The Stafford Act also opens access to the Disaster Relief Fund which currently contains about 35 billion What the national emergency declaration does then is greatly expand the resources available to states and communities for dealing with the coronavirus and the fallout from the pandemic At this moment it is the most meaningful and impactful step the administration can take on its own authority to deal with the situation These emergency powers in no way impinge on the powers of Congress or the courts nor do they significantly expand presidential power They simply allow the president to execute authorities available to him under law As for those who suggest these powers will somehow enable the president to monkey with the elections or the census … that’s absolute nonsense These emergency powers respect federalism and reflect the US disaster response system which is fundamentally a bottomup system Local communities territories Native American tribes and states retain primary responsibility for protecting their citizens But in times of emergency these governments can request assistance from the federal government which retains resources and authorities to support them What President Trump is doing is reinforcing the front lines of the fight Right now that is the single most critical part of the campaign to win the virus war"},
{"2114": "Unrest is growing Friday in the American states that have become the last holdouts in terms of announcing dates when their   will start reopening during the   outbreak As the virus continues its deadly and unpredictable spread across the US the economic losses are piling up as well with   since the closures began The overwhelming majority of states have given businesses the green light to start reopening in hopes of containing the damage with some going as far as allowing retail stores restaurants and hairdressers to start serving customers again in limited capacities But other holdouts such as   and   – despite revealing phased plans to do so – remain for the most part locked down indefinitely In Pennsylvania Gov Tom Wolf announced Friday that 13 western counties including the Pittsburgh metropolitan area would be permitted to gradually reopen next week joining 24 counties across the northern part of the state The only western county held back Beaver County is home to a severe nursing home outbreak where dozens have died and a congressman is calling for an investigation Beaver County officials blasted Wolf’s decision at a news conference Friday saying the entire county shouldn’t be forced to stay shut down because of the problems at a single facility The Beaver County district attorney meanwhile said he doesn’t want local police enforcing the business shutdown nor would he prosecute violators “Our business owners and residents cannot become prisoners in our own county” said Daniel Camp III chairman of the Beaver County Board of Commissioners calling Wolf’s decision to keep Beaver locked down “unwarranted and irrational” Wolf accused Beaver County officials of “jeopardizing lives” and said local officials’ anger at him is misdirected “I understand the frustration But again the frustration has to be directed at the real enemy here It’s the virus It’s not the regulation” he said “As we look at what we need to do to responsibly reopen the state we cant help but note that yesterday May 6  so this is now over two months since our first case  325 people walked through or were taken through the doors of hospitals” New Jersey Gov Phil Murphy   as   reportedly chanting “open New Jersey now” and “freedom over fear” New Jersey – another one of the holdouts – reopened its parks and golf courses last week Murphy around that time   can begin to be phased in as soon as we can responsibly get the health challenges under control  which he thinks could be in a matter of weeks not months But as of Friday that exact date remains unclear In Maryland   with some people calling on Gov Larry Hogan to lift the states stayathome order and closures which as of this Friday remain in effect for many industries and businesses across the state with no clear end date in sight Hogan told Fox News on Sunday that while he was sympathetic the number of confirmed cases in Maryland   “Were hoping to get our numbers to plateau so we can get things open as quickly as possible because we have too many people not working and too many businesses that are suffering” he said And in New York  which has suffered the most coronavirus deaths of any state in the nationGov Andrew Cuomo   that each region must meet before phase one of its opening plan can begin The soonest any region could start reopening is May 15 as the state’s stayat home orders expire on that date Yet some regions are being held up solely because they lack the testing levels Cuomo is seeking leaving residents guessing how long it will take to meet that threshold “I get the emotion  everybody would like to see everything reopen tomorrow Me first and foremost Everyone On every level – personally economically” Cuomo said during his daily press briefing Friday “But we are now in control and we have the virus on the run because we have been smart and because we have been disciplined” The debate on America reopening its economy hit a   as dozens of protesters  some of whom were carrying rifles – gathered inside Michigans Capitol building to voice their opposition to Gov Gretchen Whitmers stayathome order As of this week the tensions there remain as one Michigan state lawmaker was   while being flanked by armed escorts Elsewhere incidents have broken out over the use of face masks during the pandemic In Oklahoma the city of Stillwater   last week following

allegedly refused to wear a face mask and became disorderly authorities said And on the Internet debates have been raging over which Americans are following their states’ safety guidelines and

{"4463": "President Trump and his   team have been taking the stage in the White House briefing room on a closetodaily basis for weeks now often answering reporters questions for up to two hours per evening The briefings have even become a dinnertime tradition for many Americans but they are   for many in the mainstream media New York Times   declared on Tuesday that Trump spews “a thick fog of selfcongratulation political attacks misinformation and nonsense” “If the cameras were taken away perhaps Mr Trump would worry less about putting on a show” Cottle wrote “In using his platform to mislead the public the president is not serving any interest but his own In facilitating this farce neither is the media” But Fourth Watch editor Steve Krakauer told Fox News that journalists who complain about the briefings are essentially admitting defeat because “media should welcome these opportunities” to ask tough questions of the administration “Instead most of the media gets so personally invested in petty feuds that dont serve the American public Great journalists should relish every moment to question the leader of the free world poor journalists want to shield the public from their incompetence” Krakauer said “This crisis isnt going away I hope the media gets serious and focuses on substance over style and does their job to inform the American public” Prior to the coronavirus pandemic the Trump administration has essentially halted the tradition of formal press briefings as Trump opted to instead speak to the American people on Twitter and answer questions from reporters as he boarded the noisy Marine One The mainstream media regularly slammed his lack of official briefings and on Tuesday Trump mentioned as much Last month New York Times media reporter Michael Grynbaum wrote a piece questioning   networks should air the briefings live Around the same time several farleft critics of Trump condemned the briefings “I would stop putting those briefings on live TV Not out of spite but because its misinformation” MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow told viewers A handful of conservative media critics told Fox News then that these opinions were likely more selfserving Trump performed well during the briefings and therefore his critics didn’t want him to have the exposure But as the calendar has flipped to April and coronavirus continues to impact the lives of every American more and more voices have attacked the briefings “The View” cohost Joy Behar urged ABC News Jon Karl to walk out of briefings and call him a liar MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough questioned why his network bothers to air them and CNN hosts Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon have both condemned the briefings Many critics compare the briefings to campaign rallies making the case that Trump is simply interested in drumming up attention and attracting eyeballs Liberal CNN has even stirred up attention for itself by cutting in and out of briefings seemingly to make a point that some of Trump’s comments aren’t newsworthy The decision not to carry the entire event on a nightly basis has polarized the media industry “The briefings absolutely should be aired in full and the comparison to campaign rallies is willfully dishonest and an insult to the reporters in the room” The Hill media reporter Joe Concha told Fox News “Campaign rallies dont have the press corps asking questions for sometimes more than an hour Rallies dont have Dr Fauci Dr Birx Surgeon General Adams and other members of the task force team like Vice President Pence providing critical information” Meanwhile exDemocratic National Committee chair Howard Dean recently threatened not to appear on MSNBC if it airs the briefings while Daily Beast editoratlarge Rick Wilson took things a step further comparing Trump’s comments to “a monkey behind the wroughtiron White House fences throwing rhetorical feces at his chosen enemies” White House correspondentturned Spectator USA Washington editor Amber Athey told Fox News that it’s “ironic to see the same media who took at face value that China had no new coronavirus deaths refuse to allow their viewers to watch the president address the nation during a global pandemic because of concerns about ‘disinformation’” referring to recent mainstream media outlets – such as NBC News  that have been accused of publishing China talking points “We should be setting aside partisan bickering right now to come together as a nation but too many in the establishment media just can’t resist the urge to score points against Trump” Athey said Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor said the briefings are infuriating the press for two different reasons “They are boosting Trump’s popularity and he fights back against media bias” Gainor said “What’s especially amazing is the news media’s hypocrisy They love it when Gov Andrew Cuomo holds a press conference because they support him They hate it when Trump holds one because they wildly oppose him” Gainor feels traditional journalism has “thrown out any sense of ethical guidelines and does whatever it can to hurt Trump” with the talking point du jour being a call to silence the briefings Trump has been accused of everything from “hijacking” the task force for personal gain to simply   on a neardaily basis Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A Jacobson told Fox News that “Trumps daily briefings present a dilemma for CNN and MSNBC because there is huge viewer interest which normally a news network would want” but the format limits their “ability to negatively spin against Trump” in real time “So far viewer interest seems to be prevailing and both antiTrump networks show most of the briefings though CNN in particular cuts in and out to provide negative commentary” Jacobson said Status Coup founder and journalist Jordan Chariton used to cover the media industry but now focuses on progressive causes and is critical of President Trump He panned the briefings telling Fox News that “journalistic outlets have a responsibility to minimize the spread of disinformation” and thinks the only real value comes when Dr Fauci and Dr Burke are at the podium “Regardless of this he is the president  networks should take the beginning of his briefings  but I don’t take issue with them cutting away early” Chariton said Most opinions about the coronavirus task force briefings coincide with party affiliation as many liberals oppose them and the majority of conservatives want to hear from the president Some watchdogs see both sides of the argument DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall – who typically condemns the perceived liberal bias of the press  told Fox News that the briefings are “definitely newsworthy” but have their share of critiqueworthy issues and thinks shorter events would be more beneficial to Americans “The key officials leading the nations COVID19 response are right there each day with important updates the public needs to hear If these daily briefings werent happening the press would be outraged about lack of transparency and coverup” McCall said “These pressers however are way too long and that extended duration dilutes the valuable information that is provided” McCall feels that “part of the blame for the unnecessary duration is that Trump speaks too long and tries to weigh in on every aspect” but reporters also drag them out with “too many longwinded questions that are actually more like commentaries” Like Chariton McCall also feels that the majority of the news is generated before the QA when experts are providing updates “Little actual news of substance is being generated from the journalists questions which rehash old material pick fights or try to force unhelpful and impossible speculation” McCall said “These pressers need to be information events as much as possible and not promote theatrics or rhetorical jousting Trump by his nature brings drama to every circumstance but the press is also diminishing the information nature of these briefings with endless unhelpful questions and combativeness” The briefings have been routinely lasting for roughly two hours apiece which McCall feels is a waste of valuable time for experts involved when they’re busy trying to solve the coronavirus crisis “Everybody involved should make a commitment to make these briefings shorter Get the experts up there to provide key updates allow some relevant and targeted questions from the press and then let everybody get back to the real work of solving this crisis” he said “If the briefings were limited to 30 minutes it would make the decision to carry them live on cable and broadcast outlets easier and more citizens would actually want to suffer them” The mediaindustry split when it comes to the White House briefings could have a new key player soon as   on Tuesday Her predecessor Stephanie Grisham never held an oncamera briefing and it remains to be seen whether or not McEnany will get behind the James S Brady Press Briefing Room podium anytime soon"},

of the COVID19 outbreak heavily criticized Trump’s optimistic projection made Tuesday during a   “I have to respectively disagree that we’re looking to be done with this soon” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a news conference later Tuesday “We are doing all we can just to get through March April will unquestionably be worse than March May could be worse than April The New York City metropolitan area is currently suffering through the largest outbreak of the coronavirus in the country with more than 15500 cases confirmed in the city alone The top response coordinator for the White House’s coronavirus task force Dr Deborah Birx said on Tuesday that 60 percent of new cases in the country are coming from the New York metropolitan area while Vice President Pence noted that the White House has deemed the region a “highrisk area” and is surging muchneeded medical supplies to the city’s hospitals “I think the notion that we could be ‘back to normal’ in April is inconceivable at this point” de Blasio said De Blasio’s comments were echoed by lawmakers in California  another state hard hit by the virus and one where the outbreak is expected to spread even further in the coming week California Gov Gavin Newsom said Trump’s Easter timeline is sooner than any of the experts that I talked to would believe is possible The next six to eight weeks will be pivotal he said adding that soberly we look out over the course the next eight to 12 weeks and I think we could continue to do what weve done We do that hopefully then well be in a very different place than we are today In Los Angeles  the country’s secondlargest city  Mayor Eric Garcetti said politicians need to be “straightforward and honest” and not give people false hopes about the country reopening anytime soon “I know that everybody is hopeful and some are putting out that hope of us being back in churches by Easter or synagogues by Passover or restarting the economy in a couple weeks” Garcetti said during a news conference “I think we owe it to everybody to be straightforward and honest We will not be back to  that level of normal in that short period of time” Outside the hotspots of the virus  such as New York New Jersey California and Washington  state officials also expressed skepticism of Trump’s claim In Michigan Gov Gretchen Whitmer said she was worried that Trump’s “offthecuff statements will really undermine our ability to protect people” Michigan is quickly becoming another area hard hit by the contagion with more than 1700 cases in the state Wayne County  home to Detroit  sits only behind four counties in New York Washingtons King County where Seattle is and Illinoiss Cook County where Chicago is as the county with the most cases in the US “I think it’s incredibly dangerous that someone with his platform and access to all of the information that he has would make such a statement to be honest”   Both Illinois Gov JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also dismissed Trump’s Easter projection Lightfoot said that “Trump has not been a reliable leader” and that his claims “are flatout wrong” Pritzker added to this during a briefing Tuesday telling reporters that Trump only cares about the effects the virus is having on the stock market and economy He’s looking at the stock market which I know he essentially judges himself by and making decisions in that way” Pritzker said “But I think the president is not taking into account the true damage that this will do to our country if we see truly millions of people die And that’s what I think would happen that’s what the scientists and doctors say would happen” While all these lawmakers are Democrats members of Trump’s own Republican Party have also expressed skepticism in Trump’s boost to have the economy up and running by Easter Wyoming Rep Liz Cheney who serves as House Republican Conference Chair urged caution on Tuesday although she didnt explicitly address Trumps comments There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages including our doctors and nurses lay dying because we have failed to do what’s necessary to stop the virus Cheney tweeted Indeed health experts have made clear that unless Americans continue to dramatically limit social interaction  staying home from work and isolating themselves  the number of infections will overwhelm the health care system as it has in parts of Italy leading to many more deaths While the worst outbreaks are concentrated in certain parts of the country such as New York experts warn that the highly infectious disease is certain to spread “That’s really very flexible” Dr Anthony Fauci the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a prominent member of the White Houses coronavirus task force said on Tuesday of Trumps Easter timeline “You can look at a date but you’ve got to be very flexible and on a literally daybyday and weekbyweek basis You need to evaluate the feasibility of what you’re trying to do The US is now more than a week into an unprecedented 15day effort to encourage all Americans to drastically scale back their public activities  an initiative that has devastated the stock market and lead to soaring unemployment The guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif House Minority Whip Steve Scalise RLa and House Oversight Committee Ranking Member James Comer RKY on Wednesday penned a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif and the chairwoman of the Oversight committee Rep Carolyn Maloney demanding that they “immediately stop promoting irresponsible and baseless conspiracy theories” about the USPS McCarthy Scalise and Comer said that the “personal information of USPS leadership was recently posted online by malicious actors allowing protestors to approach and harass them at their homes” “This behavior is directly motivated by the fabricated attacks on the USPS that you have spearheaded and is now unnecessarily endangering the safety of hard working public servants” they wrote “Recently congressional Democrats in a broadly coordinated effort organized under your leadership have sought to spread baseless conspiracy theories about the USPS for political gain” they continued McCarthy Scalise and Comer went on to detail some of the “unfounded theories” that they claimed Democrats are pushing including USPS “removing mail boxes to prevent citizens from voting by mail that the USPS does not have adequate funding and will be insolvent before the November election and that the USPS lacks the infrastructure to deliver mailin ballots to and from voters” “As you know none of these claims has any basis in fact” they wrote “Once again Democrats have manufactured a crisis to undermine President Trump at the expense of America’s institutions” McCarthy Scalise and Comer went on to blast Democrats for “irresponsibly” denouncing costs of the USPS as “an effort to sabotage the election” They added that the USPS is “well equipped to handle the volume of mail required by an expected increase in mailin voting” “Irresponsible tactics used by Democrats that vilify the efforts of senior USPS leadership have regrettably led to malicious actors publishing the personal information of the entire Postal Board and the Postmaster General over the weekend” they wrote noting it puts them “in danger from those who believe the baseless conspiracy theories promoted by Democratic leaders in Congress” “It also hampers the USPS leadership’s ability to conduct business at a time when general election ballots are scheduled to be mailed in a matter of weeks” they warned “The right to vote is foundational to our Republic and all votes must be fairly counted  Americans should have confidence that each vote counts regardless of whether they vote in person or by mail in the 2020 election” they wrote “Your completely unfounded and baseless attacks on the USPS not only undermine the confidence and integrity of our election system but also puts the safety of USPS public servants at risk” They added “You must stop promoting misinformation campaigns immediately to prevent further serious damage to the reputation and physical security of the USPS employees and the integrity of the 2020 election” The letter to Pelosi and Maloney come amid a battle between Republicans and Democrats over mailin ballots for the 2020 presidential election Trump and the Republican Party have been warning   connected to mailin voting  despite the fact that election experts have said such claims are baseless The RNC and the Trump campaign have filed lawsuits to hit back against efforts by Democrats to make it easier for people to vote during the pandemic Democrats have said that cases of actual voter fraud extremely rare and that Republicans are trying to suppress voter turnout to improve their chances of winning elections The letter also comes as Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is expected to testify before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Friday and on Monday Aug 24 before the House Oversight Committee Congressional Democrats over the weekend demanded DeJoy and the chairman of the US Postal Service Board of Governors Robert Duncan testify over

coronavirus relief and give concessions to Republicans “Sure if they give us what we want” the president said of the post office money during a press conference last week “And its not what I want its what the American people want” Trump claimed last week that mailin voting would not be possible without the funding Its their fault Trump told FOX Business’ “Mornings with Maria” They want 35 billion for something thats fraudulent  for the mailin votes universal mailin ballots They want 25 billion for the post office They need that money so it can work and they can take these millions and millions of ballots” But if they dont get those two items then they cant have mailin ballots he said The president went on to slam voting by mail He cited states like Virginia where he said more than “500000 phony ballot applications were sent to voters” and in New York where mailin voting caused a weekslong delay in announcing results for some races in the states primary But former Vice President Joe

the drubbing taken since it was effectively shut down from the current pandemic “The economy is just going to do very well” Trump said at the daily coronavirus taskforce briefing at the White House “I think we’re going to have a big bounce…we’re going to open up very strong” Trump’s bravado was juxtaposed by the staggering jobs numbers from the week in which 66 million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits Those number now mean that one in every 10 working Americans have lost their job in the last three weeks The figures collectively constitute the largest and fastest string of job losses in records dating to 1948 By contrast during the Great Recession it took 44 weeks — roughly 10 months — for unemployment claims to go as high as they now have in less than a month The job market is quickly unraveling as businesses have shut down across the country All told in the past three weeks 168 million Americans have filed for unemployment aid The surge of jobless claims has overwhelmed state unemployment offices around the country And still more job cuts are expected More than 20 million people may lose jobs this month The unemployment rate could hit 15 percent when the

recession in decades It’s the latest unprecedented move by the Fed which has rushed to ensure cash gets to parts of the economy that need it after markets got snarled by a rush of investors pulling cash out of the system The stock market however is not the economy and the jobless numbers on Thursday made that abundantly clear Still investors are continuously looking ahead to where the economy

outbreak over the inperson casting of ballots at polling stations Five states currently vote entirely by mail Oregon Washington Colorado Utah and Hawaii Perez pointed to “the commonsense ideas that have been put in place” and stressed that “they are sorely needed across the nation” And he highlighted that voting by mail is “safe secure and accessible It’s convenient for votes It increases turnout” The push by Perez and other Democrats is facing plenty of opposition from   and Republicans who’ve long opposed moves to expand voting by mail and early voting arguing that it invites voter fraud abuse  Democrats – pushing back on such arguments – say that cases of actual voter fraud are limited and claim that Republicans are trying to suppress voter turnout to improve their chances of winning elections “Mailin voting is horrible It’s corrupt” the president stressed at a recent coronavirus daily White House briefing as he kept up his fullcourt press against expanding voting by mail Trump then suggested that “you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in someones living room signing ballots all over the place … I think that mailin voting is a terrible thing” The president didn’t offer evidence to back up his claim that voting by mail is rampant with fraud and abuse The president’s comments follow a similar attack on voting by mail just days earlier when he charged that “a lot of people cheat with mailin voting” “It shouldn’t be mailin voting Trump added It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself You don’t send it in the mail where people can

by Democrats would “vastly expand opportunities for fraud and weaken confidence in our elections but all Washington Democrats see is a potential benefit for their party” The RNC and the Trump reelection campaign launched a joint multimilliondollar legal campaign to block attempts by Democrats to change voting rules amid the coronavirus pandemic The Democratic National Committee – in pushing back against the GOP efforts – is teaming up with state Democratic parties to help voters obtain absentee ballots With the coronavirus outbreak forcing social distancing and keeping most Americans in their homes in hopes of preventing a spread of the virus nearly all the states delayed their remaining primary elections or transforming them nearly entirely to voting by mail and absentee balloting But last week – after a bitter partisan fight won by Republicans – Wisconsin became the first state to hold inperson voting during the pandemic With the state under a stayathome order thousands of poll workers refused to show up over health concerns forcing many cities and towns to cut the number of polling stations Milwaukee was down to just five polling sites from the original 180 Even though the National Guard stepped in to provide some assistance long lines instantly formed as the polls opened with many voters waiting hours to cast a ballot In many instances social distancing was extremely difficult to maintain Democrats in Wisconsin and across the nation decried the rulings to carry on with the inperson voting during the pandemic  What we saw in Wisconsin over the past two weeks was unconscionable” Perez argued “What the GOP did there opposing vote by mail forcing voters to stand in lines for hours in crowded lines” He contrasted Wisconsin’s contest with the votebymail Washington State primary that was held a month earlier “When Washingtonians voted on March 10 they were a hotspot…nationally for the coronavirus and not withstanding that the election went off incredibly successfully Participation was off the charts” he emphasized And he pointed to the efforts by some Republican governors to expand voting by mail or by absentee ballot “I want to thank and applaud Gov DeWine the governor of Iowa the governor of New Hampshire Republican governors who have recognized that using expanded vote by mail providing those options for voters

president himself told Americans to brace for “a very painful two weeks and warned of thousands more virusrelated deaths “The surge is coming and it’s coming pretty strong” Trump said Tuesday night in a change of tone from previous press briefings “This is going to be a rough twoweek period” Trump said “As a nation we’re going to have a really rough two weeks Our strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried” At another point Trump said This could be a hell of a bad two weeks This is going to be a very bad two or maybe even three weeks This is going to be three weeks like weve never seen before The extension of the social distancing guidelines comes after Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and other public health officials ominously warned that even if the US were to continue to do what it was doing  keeping the economy closed and most Americans in their homes  the coronavirus could still leave 100000 to 240000 people in the United States dead and millions infected Without any measures in place to mitigate the contagions spread those projections jump to between 15 and 22 million deaths from COVID19 “It is absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines” Trump said during the briefing “It’s a matter of life and death” The new “30 Days to Slow the Spread” guidelines  unveiled at the press conference  are an extension of the strategy the White House implemented just over two weeks ago and include guidance on social distancing working from home washing hands frequently and avoiding any unnecessary travel"},

allow himself to make recess appointments — filling vacancies in jobs he says are needed to help fight the   without the advice and consent of the Senate Presidents have the power under the US Constitution to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is out of session but the body holds what are called pro forma sessions – very brief meetings with a skeleton crew that happen when the body is not taking care of legislative business – in order to remain in session thus blocking recess appointments Trump wants to use that power to fill vacancies in executive agencies that have been largely neglected by a Senate focused mainly on lifetime judicial appointments We have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government and now more so than ever before because of the virus and the problem Trump said in remarks at the White House Wednesday Former President Obama received a Supreme Court rebuke when he tried to test the constitutionality of conducting recess appointments when the Senate is running pro forma sessions with the Supreme Court declaring that only the Senate can decide when it is in session and when it is not But Article II Section 3 of the Constitution gives the president the power to adjourn Congress to such Time as he shall think proper when the House and Senate cannot agree on when to adjourn Trump said the Senate should stop conducting its pro forma sessions and formally adjourn to allow him to make recess appointments If the House will not agree to that adjournment I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress Trump said The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis But that would require the Senate to adjourn in the first place — a move Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed reluctant to make in a statement Wednesday Leader McConnell had a conversation today with the president to discuss Senate Democrats’ unprecedented obstruction of the president’s wellqualified nominees and shared his continued frustration with the process a spokesman for McConnell told Fox News The Leader pledged to find ways to confirm nominees considered missioncritical to the COVID19 pandemic but under Senate rules will take consent from Leader Schumer If McConnell is not willing to or able to force a disagreement with the House by adjourning the body Trump likely will not be able to invoke his power to compel the adjournment and therefore would be unable to make his recess appointments That did not stop congressional Democrats from panning Trumps comments as dangerous and uninformed after his press conference Wednesday Thats what tinpot dictators do — disband legislators Rep Jamie Raskin DMd said according to an   reporter Rep David Price DNC also lambasted Trumps comments in a tweet Hi realdonaldtrump former political science professor here You have no authority to adjourn Congress atwill I encourage you to take a slightly closer or even first look at the Constitution he said Rep Justin Amash IMich  a former Republican who has been critical of Trump and is considering a thirdparty presidential run  noted that Trump does not have the power to disband Congress unless McConnell finds both a will and a way to clear the runway for the recess appointments Without one chamber participating in this improper scheme this action would be unconstitutional he said The president has no general unilateral power to adjourn Congress He may do so only in the limited Case of Disagreement between them with Respect to the Time of Adjournment Recess appointments have long been controversial and it is unlikely Senate Democrats and some Republicans would be excited to cede authority to stamp their approval on executive officials Although Obamas unconstitutional recess appointments move was different than Trumps theoretically constitutional suggestion McConnell called Obamas action a brazen power grab in 2014 after the Supreme Court ruled against the thenpresident according to a   story from the time The posts Trump would be aiming to fill would largely be the nonCabinet positions at executive agencies that have been on the backburner in the Senate With Senate Democrats feverishly resisting and delaying many of Trumps appointments McConnell has been forced to prioritize which nominees he would confirm and these posts largely are what fell by the wayside Theres only so many hours in the day when you go through judges and you go

{"3577": "Harvard University rejected calls from President Trump on Tuesday to return   relief money to the federal government maintaining that the funds from a higher education program under the CARES Act are being used to provide direct assistance to students facing financial turmoil due to the pandemic The president on Tuesday had accused Harvard of “taking”   from the government and claimed theyd be paying it back This came amid scrutiny of the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act which is meant to help small businesses but has aided some large companies too Harvard drew particular scrutiny from the president given the massive size of its endowment But a Harvard spokesman noted that the nearly 9 million in taxpayer aid it claimed did not come from the PPP program but rather from the CARES Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund which helped many universities and colleges “Harvard did not apply for nor has it received any funds through the US Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses” Harvard spokesman Jason Newton said in a statement late Tuesday “Reports saying otherwise are inaccurate President Trump is right that it would not have been appropriate for our institution to receive funds that were designated for struggling small businesses” Newton added that “like most colleges and universities Harvard has been allocated funds as part of the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund” The fund includes 14 billion in aid for universities The law allocated the funds to all colleges that participate in federal student aid programs through a funding formula based on the number of students at an institution receiving federal financial aid through Pell Grants and on the overall institutional student enrollment according to Harvard The allocation of the funding according to the CARES Act directs that 50 percent of the funds received by a college or university be used as direct financial assistance grants to students with the remaining money used to cover costs incurred by the college or university related to the COVID19 pandemic “Harvard has committed that 100 percent of these emergency higher education funds will be used to provide direct assistance to students facing urgent financial needs due to the COVID19 pandemic” Newton said He added “This financial assistance will be on top of the support the University has already provided to students – including assistance with travel providing direct aid for living expenses to those with need and supporting students’ transition to online education” Harvard is not the only university that received this type of funding through the stimulus bill According to   the amount Harvard received was in line with other Ivy League schools with Cornell and Columbia Universities receiving more approximately 128 million each Stanford receiving 73 million and Yale University receiving 68 million Other nonIvy League private universities – including Boston University New York University the University of Southern California Liberty University and Brigham Young University and more –  Of the roughly 6600 current undergraduate students at Harvard 16 percent are Pell Grant recipients Harvard also noted that in the 20182019 academic year alone the university provided more than 200 million in scholarships for its undergraduates Overnight the president fired back tweeting “Harvard should give back the money now Their whole endowment system should be looked at” As of June 2019 Harvard’s endowment was approximately 41 billion The backandforth began Tuesday evening when Trump during the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing said Harvard was “going to pay back the money” and “shouldn’t be taking it” “I’m not going to mention any other names but when I saw Harvard — they have one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country maybe in the world They’re going to pay back the money” he said Harvard also came under fire last month for  laying off its contract dining hall workers But then after coming under pressure the school reportedly rehired the employees and other workers through the end of the semester The university though according to the   provided at least 30 days of paid leave with benefits to dining hall and custodial staff whose facilities had closed Meanwhile the Senate passed a nearly 500 billion coronavirus “Phase 35” interim relief bill Tuesday that would replenish the Paycheck Protection Program provide hospitals another 75 billion and implement a nationwide virus testing program to facilitate the reopening of the economy The PPP which helps businesses with under 500 employees obtain loans that can cover eight weeks of their payroll benefits rent and other expenses was created as part of the 22 trillion CARES Act that passed last month The program converts the small business loans to grants and would be fully forgiven if 75 percent of the loan is used to keep employees on the payroll The new deal which came after days of delays driven by Democrats demands would provide more than 300 billion for the PPP among other funding"},

{"6024": "You know how I feel Two weeks ago I said we needed to flatten the curve not the economy I warned that the cure could be worse than the disease because poverty kills despair kills Of course the   is deadly but so is this shutdown You just wont see its victims in a neat little box on cable news We need to honor the victims of the virus and families whove lost loved ones Its totally wrong for anyone to dismiss or minimize the pain and suffering from the coronavirus pandemic or to ignore the federal or state guidelines But its just as wrong to dismiss or minimize the pain and suffering from the coronavirus shutdown Well we did try to capture that toll in a neat little box on cable news Already confirmed at least 99 million Americans have lost their job That doesnt even include the selfemployed the trillions in rescue money That will have to be paid for at some point If you divide the current total between every taxpayer its an average of 4500000 Of course it will be much more the current package will only last a few weeks Hundreds of thousands of businesses going under many more in September and October when the real crunch comes  more on that in a moment Then the projected toll based on what happened in the Great Recession and the Great Depression Although this shutdown is looking like it will be worse than both of those combined a mental health crisis in America mass poverty  which inexorably leads to lower life expectancy  past experience predicts that more human life will be lost from a prolonged shutdown than the models predict will be lost from this virus Those models were presented to   last Sunday and all of us on Tuesday Theyre the reason the shutdown   What they didnt tell you was this  from the man who created the main model They said the shutdown will last until April the 30th But it seems like its actually June 1st at least Since these models are driving one of the most significant policy decisions in the history of this country its reasonable to investigate them The 22 million death toll  that was on the chart in the White House briefing room It came from Imperial College London but its been debunked by some public health experts Here is Stanford epidemiologist Dr John Ioannidis The projection of 100000 to 240000 deaths even with a total national shutdown lasting until at least June 1st the factors that went into that calculation include data from   which is also being questioned by epidemiologists But okay lets ignore the public health experts questioning the data and take the projections at face value Even the worstcase scenario presented last week will be dwarfed by the longterm human toll of the shutdown More human life across a much broader range will be lost In the UK the government is modeling the health impact of the shutdown as well as the virus Our government should do that here And to be clear the public health experts are saying that when the shutdown is lifted the virus will come back So if shutdown remains the only policy we would need many more of them for at least another year until we get a vaccine The public health experts tell us the shutdown is annoying and inconvenient but we just have to accept it If you lose your job and your family is relying on it for a roof over their head thats not annoying it is terrifying If your business collapses after youve put your life into and secured your home against it thats not inconvenient It is a disaster from which it may never recover If we truly want to save lives    lives  then we need to do two things Slow the spread but speed the shutdown It must end as soon as safely possible But that means we need a better antivirus policy than we have right now Last week I said open where possible close where necessary Shutdowns do slow the spread Look at the difference between the Bay Area which had the nations first stayathome orders and New York City So right now in the absence of a better antivirus policy it is necessary to shut things down everywhere and that includes Utah Wyoming Oklahoma Arkansas Nebraska North Dakota South Dakota Iowa South Carolina where there are no statewide stayathome orders Now Im asking those governors including a great friend of this show Iowas Kim Reynolds to put in place a stayathome order at least for the duration of President Trumps slow the spread guidelines Of course that will take a high toll in those states and on our country and jobs businesses livelihoods and lives Remember this is not a choice between public health and the economy between lives and money The shutdown costs lives too The president knows this and thats why he organized the biggest and quickest rescue package for Americas workers families and small businesses weve ever seen Even though they deleted   woke wish list there are still some bad things in there and I want to focus on one that could have serious consequences The Small Business Paycheck Protection Program covers the cost of payroll rent health insurance interest and utilities for eight weeks But the amount that small businesses can get is based on their payroll costs only Rent isnt taken into account at all That is crazy Rent is a huge cost for most companies So many entrepreneurs have told me youve got to get the president to change this Many landlords right now are doing the decent thing and saying we can miss payments for the next two or three months But those landlords have bills to pay too And so theyre going to add it back onto rent payments in a few months Small businesses with tight margins wont survive that Right now the worst of the shutdown toll is the jobs crash But because of this problem with the Paycheck Protection Program small businesses right across the country will be going bust in August September October just when the economy is supposed to come roaring back just before the election Steve Mnuchin has been great in this crisis But all of that work will be for nothing if small businesses collapse because of this technical problem We can see that the president and his team are totally focused on winning the war against the invisible enemy the coronavirus In the Middle East we got bogged down in endless wars because no one knew what the objective was or had a realistic plan for achieving it With coronavirus it should be clear Its not realistic or achievable to say no one should ever get infected The goal should be to stop our hospitals from becoming overwhelmed So the immediate task is to slow the spread and surge our capacity  the extra ICU beds the ventilators the PPE that is happening That is todays battle But its not how we win the war and neither is the shutdown because when you lift the shutdown the virus comes back The American people will not put up much longer with being told there is no alternative They want to know their leaders are working on a more sustainable antivirus policy They understand we need to slow the spread but what they also want to see is a plan for speeding up the shutdown"},

into skittishness at the corner of Wall and Broad  Were going to get into why stocks were running up today Some view this as an economic light at the end of the tunnel Too soon to say that  But were

which means in a way gas prices could go up But all was well and good with that We will explore that in just a second  Now to New York and whats happening there with a surge in cases and a worry that its going to get a lot worse before it gets better  David Lee Miller in the middle of it all  David Lee  DAVID LEE MILLER FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Neil at this hour there are now more coronavirus cases in New York state than in all of China The majority of those cases are right here in New York City  There are now more than 52000 people testing positive in the city and nearly 1400 people have died  In his daily briefing today New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said based on what he called the current burn rate the state only has a sixday supply of ventilators The governor also put out an urgent call for New York businesses to manufacturer gloves gowns and other personal protection equipment  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GOV ANDREW CUOMO DNY New York Defense Production Act right  A governor cant say to a company we need you to manufacture this But I ask businesses just to think about the situation were in and a possible opportunity  END VIDEO CLIP  MILLER With the health care system overwhelmed New York City ambulance crews have been told not to bring people suffering from cardiac arrest to a hospital if the patients heart cant be restarted on the scene  A memo to EMTs from an umbrella group that coordinates emergency services said in part  and I quote  Emergency departments are severely overcrowded and transporting patients pronounced on the scene only increases ED  emergency department  workload and potentially exposes ED staff and patients to COVID19  And here at Mount Sinai Hospital they are creating what they call negative pressure rooms Window vents have been installed to create lower air pressure in areas where coronavirus patients are treated so that the air pressure is lower compared to the corridors  The idea Reduce airflow and therefore the spread of the virus  And lastly while much has been said about the vulnerability of seniors there is a stark reminder in the state of Connecticut that no one is immune A 7weekold infant who died tested positive for the virus Officials have not said what was  what the cause of death was  Neil  CAVUTO Yes you are hearing more of these younger cases not that young but its startling  And David Lee Miller thank you very much my friend David Lee Miller in New York City  I want to go to Dr Shoshana Ungerleider the Sutter Health internal medicine Shes physician there and a darn good one  Doctor I mean we tend to get sort of shocked when we hear these numbers a millionplus cases worldwide possibly in New York by the end of the night 100000 cases How and what do you tell people who get increasingly nervous many of your patients no doubt about where this is going how its accelerating  DR SHOSHANA UNGERLEIDER SUTTER HEALTH Well Neil thanks so much for having me  I think that were really wanting people to focus on what they can do which right now is to stay at home to shelter in place We know that the majority of this country has recommended by their governors for people to remain at home do everything they can to stay safe  And thats the best thing that we can do right now to keep our already fragile health care system running and to avoid getting sick yourself and overwhelming again the health care system  CAVUTO Theres been a bit of a battle brewing  I wouldnt say a battle Doctor but a difference of opinion between various medical agencies worldwide over the need for lets say face masks health masks those kind of things  The CDC saying they might in fact be a good idea Do you think theyre necessary  UNGERLEIDER Well so if youre asking whether the general public should be wearing face masks when they leave the house the answer is right you shouldnt be leaving the house  I think  I have said this but sheltering in place in your home right now even if your states governor has not made this clear where you live thats the most important thing that everyone can be doing right now if you possibly can to keep yourself and your loved ones safe  Neil back to your question I think if we had enough masks yes its absolutely prudent to ask the public to wear them But the fact remains Neil that there simply arent enough masks for the medical professionals out there let alone everybody else  CAVUTO Yes  UNGERLEIDER So the masks that are available must be used for health care workers on the front lines  And the best protection is that tightfitting N95 mask but again those must be left for the health care professionals And then the second line is that regular surgical mask the looserfitting kinds but thats also in short supply  And so what I will tell people is if youre showing symptoms of coronavirus you have been diagnosed wearing a homemade cloth mask may protect others And if you must leave the house or be in close contact with somebody whos infected a homemade mask made cut the chances of the illness being passed on  We have seen this in other countries But its important for people to know that you must wash your hands right with soap and water for 20 seconds after touching the front of that mask because that will be contaminated  CAVUTO Right  UNGERLEIDER And again the best thing that we can do to avoid getting this virus and avoid spreading it is to stay home right now  CAVUTO Yes I think youre right Thank you for calming me down Doctor I appreciate that  And thank you for all youre doing Much appreciated  By the way something that was rattling a lot of folks today but you wouldnt see it in the markets was a sudden surge in unemployment claims in other words the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits hitting 66 million in the latest period on top of last weeks roughly 325  Were at 10 million Americans whove applied for jobless protection in little more than eight days time  Deirdre Bolton following that and the anomaly we had of Wall Street just soaring ahead  DEIRDRE BOLTON FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT Yes  CAVUTO Deirdre sort it out for me  BOLTON Sort it out  All right lets start with those jobless claims As you mentioned Neil were close to 10 million in two weeks And just for a contextual points this twoweek period and the 10 million workers applying for benefits that outweighs the first of six months total that we saw in the last recession about a decade ago  So it just carries home this point I mean if you look at state to state California more than 800000 people applying for benefits Now part of this is that Congress has really expanded the categories of people who can apply for unemployment benefits so for example parttimers freelancers  So many many more heads if you like Neil are being counted And in fact a few economists that I spoke with today said this time next week we could see another between four and five million prints if you like on this weekly jobless claims number  If you think about it about 80 percent of our country is locked down in one form or another we know that has taken such a heavy toll on restaurants on all kinds of businesses And that certainly is showing up in the numbers  One thing thats interesting too Neil of course that were going to be looking at tomorrow is this March jobs print that we are expected to get tomorrow And of course February was 35 percent near a record low  Economists that I have been speaking with say that March the March data that were going to get tomorrow is not going to encompass a lot of what were talking about right now And there may be some blips in the screen but theyre really saying April is going to be the month that were really going to see the effects of everything that were going through from an economic point of view show up  We had the Saint Louis Fed who issued by my reading at least the most pessimistic view on our labor market saying sometime this summer we could see unemployment go as high as 30  30  percent  When I spoke with some economists about their reaction to that they said OK thats really the most pessimistic case by far We know that Goldman Sachs as far as GDP this bigger picture view of our economy says OK second quarter is going to be a disaster Neil a contraction of about 34 percent  But then in the third quarter we could bounce back and see GDP back up an expansion if you would like of 19 percent So obviously all eyes are going to be on that jobs data tomorrow  Neil as you know very well today a lot of the green on the screens today was thanks to the energy the move in oil like a 20 percent move one of the biggest moves ever And of course we saw that affect the equity markets  So you had energy industrials materials also financials they were the ones responsible for putting the green on the screens which we will say from an investors point of view nice to see for the first day in three  Neil back to you  CAVUTO All right well covered Joltin  Joltin Bolton Deirdre Bolton thank you very very much  And to her point oil did surge about 20 percent today still at very low levels And that helped big Dow components like ExxonMobil and Chevron  Again a lot of this came after President Trump checked in with the Saudi crown prince and Vladimir Putin essentially saying maybe you should let bygones be bygones bury the hatchet do something about oil production  We are told the two countries have agreed to scale back oil production about 10 million barrels a day Thats the goal at least But a lot of these pledges can unravel  But that was a big reason for the advance in oil because when it gets too too low it can be damaging So thats what happened today  Lets get the read on all this with Senator Tim Scott the beautiful state of South Carolina  I didnt think the day would come Senator when wed be welcoming higher oil prices here but its the times in which we live They have crashed too far  SEN TIM SCOTT RSC Absolutely  CAVUTO What do you make of that  SCOTT Well theres no doubt that stabilizing the oil market  any time you have a fight between Saudi Arabia and Russia it really leads to lower prices  And if you think if youre in the Oklahoma area or South Dakota the shale industry really depends on prices around 45 or 50 per barrel So this is really good news for the energy sector  CAVUTO Right  SCOTT Not as good news for those of us at the pump but ultimately really good for a global economy that needs stability And stability comes really in one form And thats confidence  We need to infuse more confidence into the market As we see that confidence you will start seeing the market take off in different sectors The best thing we can do is to continue to provide the type of stimulus that really makes sense thats targeted and temporary  But what we saw today in the energy market energy sector is really good news  CAVUTO Senator theres been talk already that the three stimulus measures we have had including the biggest one the 2223 trillion one thats already filtering through the system and a lot of people will see checks in a matter of weeks that thats not enough  A number are saying we need a bigger stimulus package a fourth round The president has kicked around the idea of an infrastructure measure Democrats are looking at changing some tax provisions including the limit in mortgage tax deductions et cetera  Where do you stand on this Do we need yet another relief package  SCOTT Neil you made some really good points there that need to be unpacked a little bit  Speaker Pelosi is looking for a way to strip the SALT deductions from the tax program What that basically means is giving more money to folks making 200000 or more and taking it from the people who make less than 200000 a really bad idea  The president has certainly floated the idea and been very supportive of the concept of an infrastructure plan The definition of infrastructure is becoming more and more important as people want to expand that definition  My theory is simple We just put 22 trillion into the market If you include the commercial facility that could be another 4 trillion of activity so literally a 6 trillion infusion depending on how you look at it  It would be really important for me to see how the 6 trillion or the simple 2 trillion is impacting the market impacting the average person in our country How does it impact the person working every day of the week trying to make their paychecks meet  Those questions should be answered before we dive into phase four blindly There are some spots that we can see now that are starting to emerge as trouble spots If you are a commercial property owner all the folks in your  all your tenants are being given the sign dont worry about paying your rent itll be OK for 60 or 90 days  Well if youre the person who has the ultimate mortgage thats not OK So were going to have to wind down that road a little bit and figure out how to make sure that what was done in phase two which left holes that we had to fix in phase three  CAVUTO All right  SCOTT Thats not happening now  CAVUTO Senator we will watch it closely Thank you for taking the time as always  Be well Be healthy Be safe Senator Scott of South Carolina  SCOTT Thank you sir  By the way diagnosed with the virus survives the virus and now is donating plasma to help other people who are dealing with that same virus  An amazing story  after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO What if I told you maybe the best way to help those diagnosed with the coronavirus or testing positive for it is to give them the blood plasma from those whove had and survived the virus  Jason Garcia is one of them He didnt waste a nanosecond trying to help out those who are dealing with this by offering to donate his own plasma to an ICU patient a very selfless act It doesnt surprise me the more I read about Jason  But Jason thank you very much for joining us  How are you feeling first off  JASON GARCIA CORONAVIRUS SURVIVOR Im feeling great Im happy that this turned out to be a positive outcome but Im doing well  CAVUTO Now explain to me your trajectory with this when you first found out you tested positive and then the  coming out of it  GARCIA So when I first tested positive it was just kind of scary  Immediately my thoughts were my family I possibly exposed them the isolation I have to do and then also the coworkers I possibly might have exposed  But I spent a few days in isolation and then March 16 I started to feel symptomfree And then on March 23 I was actually given permission to leave isolation from the San Diego County Public Health  And then from there thats where I kind of started talking on social media and telling people now  telling people that I survived the COVID19 disease  So from there word caught out And thats when St Josephs Hospital reached out to me They were in urgent need of looking for someone that was 14 days symptomfree that tested positive for COVID19 to help use their   my plasma and help a critically ill patient  And thats kind of how this whole donation thing came about was the hospital reaching out to me And I knew this was like a needle in a haystack this early on in the US for someone to be 14 days recovered and symptomfree  So I was happy to  so no hesitation I just went ahead and did it  CAVUTO Im very impressed Jason  Its so weird for you just must  just to get your head wrapped around this that you go from having the virus to being potentially or at least your blood your plasma being a potential cure for those who are dealing with the virus  So there must be something in the blood of survivors like yourself thats unique because the medical community is still impressed with that  Im wondering if you  I know youre not a doctor and all but have they said that is a promising area the guys and people like you who have dealt with this that you might be the secret weapon to beat this  GARCIA Im hoping thats the case  Im hoping that others will be able to donate and people have a good positive reaction to this type of treatment because it is a new treatment But yes Im  hope for the best  CAVUTO No Im impressed  Jason Im curious because a lot of people always ask when  Neil when you talk to someone who has this or who has survived this what is it like What did they experience that Im experiencing  So could you share some of that with us  GARCIA Yes  So for me it was a really severe cough that started it out And pretty much it was like a cold There are some weird symptoms that  because I usually know my body and how I react to a normal cold and  but I did end up getting some of the other symptoms that COVID19 is known for such as shortness of breath  Usually I dont experience that with a cold I dont experience headaches I ended up having headaches for a day My fever only lasted for a day It was relatively short So my symptoms werent  I had some severe symptoms but they were very shortlived  CAVUTO Yes  GARCIA It didnt last very long  And yes it was kind of a little bit like a cold but somewhat different that I was able to pretty much say I think I need to go get tested  CAVUTO Well Im glad youre doing OK  And Im very impressed that no sooner after that youre doing something selfless as this to help someone else who doesnt want to be in the same predicament  Jason Garcia thank you very much We needed to hear that story and your story Youre very impressive  Jason Garcia donated plasma within just a short time of him coming out of all of that  Meanwhile looking at a ship thats now heading to port in Florida Whats it like to be on that ship  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DR ANTHONY FAUCI NIAID DIRECTOR You have to take care of the people who are ill You just have an obligation to do that  And as quickly as possible you have got to get the people who are not sick who are not infected off the ship  END VIDEO CLIP  CAVUTO And thats what theyre trying to handle right now  This is the Holland America Zaandam It is making its way to Port Everglades in Florida The only question is how many are going to be able to get off that ship There are at least two others nearby that are kind of dealing with similar issues cases on board those with the coronavirus in one ships case four who have died from that better than 100 diagnosed with the virus  Emily Spindler Brazell is one of the more unique cases She was on the Zaandam later transferred  transferred I should say to the Rotterdam She exhibited no symptoms  She joins us now via FaceTime to update us on what the heck happened  Emily how are you feeling first off  EMILY SPINDLER BRAZELL PASSENGER Im feeling great   You should see the smile on my face as I look at Fort Lauderdale  LAUGHTER  SPINDLER BRAZELL Sorry the FaceTime didnt work  CAVUTO Oh yes  SPINDLER BRAZELL We were transferred to Rotterdam because the Rotterdam is on humanitarian mission to save its sister ship the Zaandam because we were turned away in 11 South American and Central American ports  CAVUTO OK  SPINDLER BRAZELL And we are so thankful that were no longer being turned away  CROSSTALK  CAVUTO Im sorry  Were any on the  I apologize We have this  I will eventually get this down with these home studios  But Emily were  anyone on the Zaandam where you were first dealing with this with the virus And then how did they handle it  SPINDLER BRAZELL The Zaandam had cases of flulike symptoms  So they shut down and put us all in our rooms starting on March 22 And we were isolated I have my husband thank goodness for companionship And we were isolated along with everyone else  We havent really seen anyone except for our brief transfer with masks and gloves and no touching when we transferred ships on the 28th And everyone wore masks and they were very careful  So we have been basically isolated for 12 days in our cabin We  the only reason Im talking to anyone and I started was because we have been treated so well And a few of the stories were so bleak and they may be that persons experience but it wasnt the experience of the  most of the guests  We have been  I cant even tell you how well we have been treated with not only like meal service but also closedcircuit entertainment and workouts so we dont get so big with all the meals you know  CROSSTALK  CAVUTO I would just be hanging around the buffet myself  But Emily did you have a choice with this In other words when they got you off to this other ship  and now you probably have heard the controversy over many in Florida were leery to let either ship dock in the state  Have they told you whats going to happen when you do dock in Fort Lauderdale what you and your husband are going to do  SPINDLER BRAZELL Yes  CAVUTO Do you have to wait on board What did they say  SPINDLER BRAZELL Ill answer your question  We werent given a choice to say  we could have said no I heard a friend of mine did But I wanted to transfer because the staff was also getting sick on the ship And I didnt want to put a burden on them  CAVUTO Hmm  SPINDLER BRAZELL It was starting to get very hard for them to care for 1200 passengers daily three meals et cetera  CAVUTO Sure  SPINDLER BRAZELL The laundry  So we moved 800 of us And it took three days in very small groups with social distancing What is supposed to happen now is we are going to be at Holland Americas expense transported to our home gateway and this includes 15 global countries  Its quite an endeavor We should not be even stepping more than a few feet away of our little footprints on Florida and then moving on to our charter planes or whatever I dont know exactly for us Americans what we will travel on  CAVUTO All right  CROSSTALK  CAVUTO Well I wish you Emily and your husband well Just hang in there  SPINDLER BRAZELL Yes we are well And we  CAVUTO It sounds like you have a great attitude through it  SPINDLER BRAZELL We are excited to go home  And we want to help everyone get taken care of now including the crew I still think theyre being overlooked by the world community  But that will be my new  something I will help with when I get on land  CAVUTO Youre very impressive very selfless of you as well  Best of luck Get home safe your husband as well everybody on the ship Thank you very very much  All right a lot more to come here including some of the small gestures done that make a big difference sometimes in ways you would never imagine  after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right were waiting to hear from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis  He is facing not one not two but now three ships that are trying to make their way to ports in Florida Some controversy those Florida communities saying not here  The governor saying yes here and by the end of tonight  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right waiting for the Florida governor to address the folks  A lot going on there certainly with the ships and everything else and a lot of Florida businesses that are in a heap of trouble and then of course the stayathome provision that takes effect later tonight in the Sunshine State We will keep you abreast of that  But I did tell you about businesses that again are in that world of hurt Theyre waiting again for some of that stimulus dough coming their way  Karen Kerrigan is the Small Business and Entrepreneurial Council CEO joining me right now via Skype  Karen always good to have you  Do your members know how to get this money or the process you have to go through to get either the loans andor grants  KAREN KERRIGAN CEO SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL COUNCIL Well many of them have already applied for the economic injury loans which come directly from the Small Business Administration  But the new program that begins tomorrow on April 3 the paycheck protection program that is going to be basically administered by the banks many of them already know that they have to go to SBAapproved lenders  And according to Treasury almost every bank in this country and credit union has been given the authority to do these loans So theyre already communicating with their banks in terms of what they need to do to apply  And the banks themselves are saying lookit we need AUDIO GAP from Treasury before we launch this program So theres some issues regarding guidance and clarity I think that everyone wants in order to do this successfully in order to deploy this capital as quickly as possible  CAVUTO Karen as you know this latest 30day extension the stayathome provisions that means a lot of these businesses are shuttered restaurants and so so much more  Do you worry if it goes beyond that And you get very different figures and estimates and both in the medical community business community But I would imagine many of the people with whom youre dealing cant go much longer like this  KERRIGAN Well they cant  They needed the capital last week or the week before And although theyre scrambling theyre grinding it out theyre pivoting every day is a new challenge I think many of them have come to the sad conclusion that this is going to go on longer than we thought even last week or even this weekend the past weekend  For example in the state of Virginia the governor has extended the stay athome order to June 10  CAVUTO Right  KERRIGAN So that means theres going to be a lot of restrictions on economic activity And that hits small businesses really hard  So this capital cannot come fast enough And as I said the businesses themselves are really doing a lot to innovate collaborate actually developing their own funds  I had one member say the cavalry is not coming people We are the cavalry  So theyre doing a lot more to invest in others in their communities and set of funds because the government hasnt been there yet  CAVUTO Karen what I wonder about too whether there is an immediate snapback I dont mean to be a halfemptyglass person but that people might think twice about going into crowded situations that this distance thing that started through all of this stays a while that people will be leery to crowd into packed theaters or venues even stadiums sporting events even businesses  Do you worry about that  KERRIGAN Well I worry about that of course because AUDIO GAP layoffs thats to come right  So youre going to have a lot of people who are consumers I think that are going to be very careful with their dollars  CAVUTO Right  KERRIGAN So were very optimistic as Im an entrepreneur and I  we represent entrepreneurs Were always optimistic that there will be a recovery  But yes I mean absolutely were concerned about the robustness and the quickness of that recovery And thats another thing that many businesses are planning for because Neil they went into this year the optimistic thing was that they thought 2020 was going to be their best year  And they have got more inventory They were hiring people They were expanding  CAVUTO Absolutely  KERRIGAN And then this hit AUDIO GAP plunge in revenues  CAVUTO Yes  KERRIGAN So like I said we have got our fingers crossed And were hoping tomorrow with the launch of this PPP program and if these economic injury loans can move quicker through the system or we will at least get some capital to these small businesses  CAVUTO All right we will get through this  Karen I have never heard you anything less than robust and optimistic so I have a feeling we will survive you will survive  KERRIGAN Thank you  CAVUTO Karen thank you so much Always good seeing you  All right in the meantime you have seen these little hospitals or tent cities It looks like that certainly in Central Park but Im telling you theyre popping up everywhere and I mean everywhere  We will show you some of the places  after this  COMMERCIAL BREAK  CAVUTO All right Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is speaking to the press right now dealing with those three ships that are coming very close to port right now as well as stayathome provisions that take effect tonight  Lets listen to the Florida governor  JOINED IN PROGRESS   GOV RON DESANTIS RFL  deploy agency employees to assist DEO with their reemployment assistant efforts including call center operations and other citizen services  We have I think about 25000 state employees who are either telecommuting or ARE nonessential and I have told to stay at home We wouldnt need all that but we certainly could use some  And so different agency heads are already working to figure out how they could bring this manpower to bear I think this requires all hands on deck We have a lot of state government functions that are generally important but just arent as important right now given what were dealing with  So we want to be able to utilize all the manpower that we have I have also been in contact with ATT and Verizon about ways we can do calling that would work well in an age of social distancing where people could be able to do this potentially from their homes  And so this is a very very top priority so that people  because I think people  when you have these abrupt changes to just be able to talk to someone on the phone or to know that you submit something it actually goes through obviously you want to be able to get the assistance But if you can at least have a system where people are able to get in touch with somebody I think that that would give people a lot more peace of mind  And of course I have also directed as youre able to expand this we want to work on the processing to be much quicker than it has been in the past And so were willing to put manpower for that as well  Because this whole Web platform is overloaded people should be able to fill out a paper application if they  if thats an option for them We shouldnt limit how theyre able to apply And so were going to beef up the call centers  I have ordered them to beef up or create an alternative for online submissions But at the end of the day if people want to submit an application in person or drop it off then we should be willing to accept that So I have ordered them to make all available options available for people to be able to do that  And then I have asked  Im ordering the Department of Economic Opportunity to immediately purchase on an emergency basis additional capacity software technology and other resources as needed to ensure the states call center Web site and staff can accommodate the increasing volumes of applications and queries  This is  I wish I could say that this is just something thats only going to last a couple of weeks but I think that this is not something that you can just turn on and off an economy like this  So we need to expand the capacity but just understand that this is going to be a problem that could be with us more than just a couple of weeks  So I think that thats going to be something that will be very much needed So in terms of our economic priorities this is our top priority to be able to field the calls and be able to respond appropriately to the people of Florida  And I have all agencies now working And we have already just today been able to identify some pretty interesting options And I think were going to continue to build on that and really bring a lot of force to bear  So I told everyone you need to be making plans and identifying people right now so that we can deploy them immediately  The other executive order I have done today relates to mortgage foreclosure and eviction relief Were suspending foreclosures for 45 days and also suspending evictions for 45 days Im not sure that youre going to rent out a lot of new places right now anyways but nevertheless you just never know how people act  So given the circumstances I think that those suspensions are warranted  An update on the travel We have screened by air and car almost 11000 people since my executive orders went into effect And again the folks that are coming from hot spots like New York City or New Orleans are required to self isolate for 14 days upon entering the state of Florida  We are looking at  as you look at some of the statistics about what were seeing with caseload here in Florida probably the number one message from the beginning for us has been those people who are 65 and older particularly if you have an underlying condition you really need to be staying at home and limiting your contacts with people because of the way this virus affects those in that age group  If you look at Floridas cases 25 percent of the cases are with people 65 and plus 54 percent of the hospitalizations in Florida have been 65 and plus and 86 percent of the fatalities have been 65 and plus So please heed that directive to stay at home as much as possible  And please limit contact with others We want that for everybody but particularly in that 65andup category or people that have serious underlying conditions Those are the folks that are the most at risk from this disease  We are continuing to monitor the bed availability Numbers have been pretty  pretty similar You see little movements here or there But most of the major areas in terms of availability percentage are in the 40 percent range but obviously were continuing to monitor that as well  There have been some questions about order yesterday involving essential services and essential activities And people will say well can I do  can I go fly a kite Can I do this Can I do that  And I think the way to think about it is when youre limiting people to essential services and essential activities the goal is to reduce contacts with people outside the home That is why that is in place  And so its less important what you do than how you do it For example if you want to go for a 10mile run by yourself and come back more power to you but you wouldnt be able to do a 20person road race in the neighborhood with 19 of your friends  So is running an essential activity Yes if its done in consistent with social distancing guidelines You could go  if you have a basketball hoop in your driveway go shoot hoops all day Thats fine But youre not going to be able to do a fiveonfive pickup game where youre going to be in close contact with other people  Someone wants to take their son fishing by all means go do it But youre not going to be able to get 25 people on a boat and go fishing in some type of group outing  So less important about can you do X or Y but simply how are you going to do X or Y And if youre engaging in activity that doesnt involve close contact with other people youre going to be fine If you are doing things even if youre staying at home and you have 10 15 people at the house thats going to be close contacts with people And thats what were trying to avoid  So if you think about it that way what were trying to do is reduce the transmission of the virus Viruses have different reproduction rates And this is a virus that typically transmits when people are in close contact with somebody else  And so if you can refrain from that we can reduce the transmission rate And if you reduce the transmission rate far enough the virus can eventually have fewer places to go  So thats what were trying to do on that And I know people have had a lot of questions But just think about if Im engaging in an essential service or Im engaging in an essential activity am I doing it in a way thats limiting contacts  And if you are youre probably going to be OK If youre doing things that have a lot of contacts then its not going to be OK  And with that happy to take some questions  QUESTION OFFMIKE  DESANTIS No Im confident some have  We are not really keeping  Health isnt publishing those statistics Its something that I have asked about And so we are  I would like to see them then publish that  Now obviously you have got to follow people And there are some people who will present particularly in certain age groups and you know that they dont require real medical care They just need to go home and be home for 14 days  And so I dont know how much followup there is on those people but I its a good question The other thing that were  what Id like to see with the deaths statistics obviously you can see it based off age But how  what percentage of those fatalities involve people with significant underlying conditions  I think that would be good I think its almost  I think its a huge percentage But that would also be another warning sign for somebody Even if youre not 65 if you have some of these conditions like diabetes if you have immune system deficiencies that this is definitely something you want to limit your contact with other people to be able to protect yourself  Yes sir  QUESTION OFFMIKE  DESANTIS So obviously  one I dont think the government has the authority to close a church Im certainly not going to do that  At the same time we got with the churches and the synagogues very early and said in times like this what you guys are doing I think is even more important But we ask that you do it in a way that is going to be conducive to this overall mission  And I would say almost all of them 100 percent agree Some have gone virtual Some have had people but they have been spread out far enough I mean you guys are spread out here in this press conference Theres no reason why you couldnt do a church service with people 10 feet apart  So we definitely ask them to absolutely abide by the social distancing guidelines But I think that the  in times like this I think the service that theyre performing is going to be very important for people especially when you have difficult circumstances  And so do it right Make sure that youre following the mission But I think particularly coming up on the Easter season I think people are going to want to have access to religious services whether its online whether its in a more socially distant type of service but to have that available I think is very important  QUESTION OFFMIKE  DESANTIS No look and people  we tried  people had questions I didnt actually think  I thought it was understood So we just said OK we will clarify it and put it out there  I mean basically folks can  we have the baseline If some folks want to do some do  do things more then they can do more in certain situations And so we want to work with the local folks I think each region in Florida is very distinct  And some of these things may need to be approached a little bit differently And Im happy to  happy to work with them about it And we have let everyone know that from the beginning  QUESTION OFFMIKE  DESANTIS Well I mean I dont know that they would have the authority quite frankly to close a religious  I mean like the Constitution doesnt get suspended here  Theres got to be ways where you can accommodate So I would tell them work with the folks work with the rabbis work with the pastors to get it right But I think its got to be more of a collaborative thing But generally speaking yes they can go beyond what I have done if they want to restrict access to certain  certain areas  I mean for example were saying you can go out for a jog And I know theres running trails If a local wants to just shut down the running trail and they want to do that then they can do it And thats just going to be their decision  QUESTION OFFMIKE  DESANTIS No its our  our intent on that is were  were obviously doing essential services  Were doing  were doing the restrictions on that So theyre not going to be able to say oh well the governor says you cant have these types of contracts We think you can have  CAVUTO All right we are listening to Governor Ron DeSantis  The upshot here earlier he talked about these ships that are making their way to Port Everglades Florida here  We do know that between the Zaandam and the Rotterdam there are at least 13 passengers who are sick and will need some medical help We assume they have tested positive of the virus and will need some medical help  How they get all the others off board in between the two ships were talking better than 6000 passengers All this could happen within the next few hours And the governor was also referring to stayathome provisions that kick in later tonight in Florida  He was one of the last governors in the country to do so There are still about nine others that have not But there was some surprise some criticism that he got that going rather late  But be that as it may it all kicks in later tonight  Phil Keating right now with the very latest at least on where this whole ship saga is going  Phil  PHIL KEATING FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Good afternoon Neil  Just two days shy of a full month at sea Holland Americas Zaandam is now docking over there at terminal 21 soon to tie on to the pylons onshore and then begin the as far as the passengers are concerned very long overdue process of disembarking for good so they can finally make their ways back home  The Zaandam left Buenos Aires Argentina on March 7 It was supposed to go around the tip of South America and up to Chile and then end the cruise there  But its been stuck at sea for the past two weeks because the global coronavirus shutdown happened while the ship and their vacations were out at sea So no  about a dozen countries refused to help and let the ship come ashore or even to airlift some of these critically ill passengers to hospitals on  into those countries  But it is finally here It was about a twoandahalf day heavy discussion between the unified authority that runs the port along with the Broward County commissioners on to  as to how exactly these people are going to be removed without exposing anybody in Florida specifically Broward County to potential COVID19  So the plan is 1200 healthy people on board They will be disembarking first They all had health screenings out a few miles off shore earlier this afternoon So they will then with masks go straight into sterilized buses and shuttles and go directly to the airport to the tarmac to get onto planes either charter or regular passenger plane and then go back to their countries or their cities and finally meander their way back home  The sister ship is the Rotterdam And I can see it coming in the up the channel Its still about a mile out It is also going to tie up over there behind me And those people  it has a lot of crew board on board that one as well  And all of the healthy people the people who never were sick during the past two weeks they were transferred to the Rotterdam off the coast of Chile And so theyre all going to begin disembarking now  The authorities here have said this could take two three maybe even four days to get everybody off The 10 critically ill on board the Zaandam will be taken immediately to a hospital here And then the 45 who have minor illnesses they have to get better first before they can get off the ship   Neil  CAVUTO So it could be a little while  Phil Keating great reporting as always Thank you very much  I want to switch to Washington now Mike Emanuel  Were going to have another health care task force briefing at the White House  What can we expect Michael  MIKE EMANUEL FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT Well Neil we understand that from our colleague John Roberts at the White House that in addition to the president the vice president perhaps Drs Fauci and Birx that we will also hear from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Small Business Administrator Carranza that reporting from John Roberts  All indications are after a staggering unemployment number out this morning and the jobs report out tomorrow morning first Friday of the month that there will be a business focus in addition to a health care focus to some of this  Itll be interesting to see what other VIPs the president may be bringing with him today to this comprehensive briefing These briefings have taken many questions day by day by day There are more questions today  But obviously there are some concerns about whether the United States is starting to follow the Italy model We have also heard from some lawmakers a lot of concern about what China has been doing in terms of not being transparent from the very beginning not being straight with the American government about how many patients they had  And so it will be interesting to see which directions reporters will take this briefing with the president vice president and top administration officials who are responding to this coronavirus challenge day after day after day  We have seen on Capitol Hill the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer urging the president to name a military figure to basically oversee the distribution of all the resources  But the president says hes got military people there He says hes in good shape  Neil  CAVUTO All right Mike Emanuel thank you very very much  The president will also be meeting tomorrow with oil industry executives They had a good day today as far as their stocks and everything because oil prices zoomed up the president intervening and getting in the middle of that SaudiRussia rift to try to get things under control And oil prices jumped a lot  Here comes The Five "},

out of context and run with negative headlines” The presidents comments came after administration officials presented findings of a study that suggested increased heat light and humidity in the summer could decrease the time it takes for the coronavirus to disperse on surfaces and in the air and potentially slow the spread of the disease during the warmer months They also said that isopropyl alcohol and bleach were highly effective in tests at killing the virus on surfaces  with bleach killing it in as few as five minutes and isopropyl alcohol doing so in just 30 seconds Trump then

think you said youre gonna test that too Sounds interesting right He continued And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute One minute And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or or almost a cleaning Because you see it gets on the lungs and it does a tremendous number so it will be interesting to check that So that youre going to have to use medical doctors But it sounds it sounds interesting to me So well see But the whole concept of the light the way it kills it in one minute thats thats pretty powerful After Trumps initial comments in which he did suggest there might be a way to do something like that by injection inside or or almost a cleaning after changing the topic from light to disinfectants but made clear it was not a definitive recommendation and said medical doctors should be involved in any tests a reporter asked Bryan to clarify what the president said The president mentioned the idea of a cleaner Is the bleach and isopropyl alcohol he mentioned theres no scenario that could be injected into a person is there the reporter asked No Im here to talk about the findings that we had in the study We dont do that within that lab at our labs Bryan responded Trump then jumped in with further comments Were talking about almost a latent sterilization of an area Maybe it works maybe it doesnt work but it certainly has a big effect if its on a stationary object Trump said not explicitly disavowing the possibility using disinfectants to treat humans which has been roundly declared dangerous by medical experts and makers of such products After multiple questions on other topics Trump then turned a query from a reporter about why places like Florida which have higher heat and humidity than other parts of the country are still seeing significant numbers of coronavirus cases to the topic of potentially treating people I mean theres been a rumor that you know a very nice rumor that you go outside in the sun or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses Trump said referencing previous speculation that factors like heat light and humidity in the summer could lead to a decrease  though not an entire stoppage  in coronavirus cases But now we get it from one of the great laboratories of the world I have to say it covers a lot more territory than just this This is this is probably an easy thing relatively speaking for you Trump said looking off to his right toward some of his administrations experts who were at the briefing I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if theres any way that you can apply light and heat to cure You know if you could and maybe you can maybe you cant Again I say maybe you can Maybe you cant Im not a doctor Im like a person that has a good you know what Trump said pointing toward his head then looking over to Dr Deborah Birx You ever have you ever heard of that The heat and the light relative to certain viruses Yes but relative to this virus Not as a treatment Birx responded from off to the side appearing to choose her words carefully I mean certainly fever is a good thing when you a fever it helps your body respond But not as Ive not seen heat or light I think its a great thing to look at I mean you know Trump responded Immediately after the exchange with Birx which did not include talk about hazardous treatments using disinfectants a reporter challenged Trump on his speculation about potential coronavirus cures Respectfully sir youre the president and people tuning into these briefings they want to get information and guidance and want to know what to do Theyre not looking for rumors the reporter said Trump responded combatively Im the president and you are fake news And you know what Ill say to you Ill say it very nicely Trump said You ready Its just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very very smart perhaps brilliant man Hes talking about sun Hes talking about heat And you see the numbers So thats it Thats all I have Im just here to present talent Im here to present ideas because we want ideas to get rid of this thing And if he does good and if sunlight is good thats a great thing as far as Im concerned Trump in his response appeared to take Bryans findings which did not mention using light as a treatment for humans but rather a factor that could mitigate the coronavirus spread over the summer out of context to support his suggestion that light could be used to fight the coronavirus in infected individuals The exchange between Trump and the reporter like Trumps exchange with Birx did not mention hazardous cleaning products as a prospective treatment as Trump did earlier in the briefing Ultraviolet light can harm cells which is why more sunlight over the summer could presumably help slow the spread of the coronavirus But it harms human cells as well meaning the intentional use of manmade ultraviolet light is not considered a serious option for treating the coronavirus But a certain type of it could be used according to one   researcher in public buildings to kill the virus before it infects people in the first place David Brenner the director of Columbias Center for Radiological Research said in a story released on the universitys website that farUVC a kind of ultraviolet light that is not harmful to humans could be used to kill airborne viruses minutes after theyve been breathed coughed or sneezed into the air FarUVC light has the potential to be a ‘game changer’” Brenner said according to the story “It can be safely used in occupied public spaces and it kills pathogens in the air before we can breathe them in Brenner said that he has used that type of light to eradicate other viruses before and is currently testing it on the novel coronavirus He noted however that the light is not a treatment for sick people as Trump suggested but instead a way to prevent people from getting sick in the first place FarUVC takes a fundamentally different tactic in the war against COVID19” he said “Most approaches focus on fighting the virus once it has gotten into the body FarUVC is one of the very few approaches that has the potential to prevent the spread of viruses before they enter the body"},
{"4462": "Everyone is saying the country should come together in battling the coronavirus and yet the entire effort is cloaked in political partisanship That only intensified after President Trump held an evening news conference which was widely panned by the media It’s probably not realistic to expect a suspension of political sniping in the face of a potential emergency During past crises such as Ebola and the BP oil spill during the Obama years presidents have routinely been challenged for being too slow or not doing enough But a crisis unfolding in this polarizing atmosphere with the stock market already in correction territory feels very different Trump took a shot at the media as the Chinese virus was spreading around the globe tweeting “Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC Comcast  CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible including panicking markets if possible” Actually figures show the two networks haven’t been covering the virus more than Fox News and other outlets and overall I think the press has been relatively restrained in covering the possible pandemic The Democrats meanwhile starting taking shots at the administration with Nancy Pelosi saying its response was “too late and anemic” Both media and political critics noted that Trump had tried to cut certain health programs that would come in handy right about now At a news conference Wednesday evening Trump said he doesn’t think he’s on a different page from federal health officials even though they think a serious outbreak in the US is “inevitable” and he does not The president talked about how tens of thousands of Americans die each year from the flu and said if Democrats and some Republicans want to provide more than the 25 million he’s requested in emergency aid he’s happy to take it But Trump’s tone grew sharper under questioning from reporters as he said “Speaker Pelosi is incompetent” and “she’s trying to create a panic and there’s no reason to panic because we have done so good” Seconds after the Trump presser liberal commentators and even some anchors started ripping him for being more optimistic than his own federal health officials Some also ripped the choice of Mike Pence to oversee the effort claiming he was antiscience as Indiana’s governor The criticism mounted yesterday The  led off a piece recalling “Sharpiegate” when Trump used a pen to alter a hurricane map saying such incidents undermined his credibility “Now as the coronavirus races across the globe and has begun to threaten the United States Mr Trump could face a moment of reckoning Maintaining a calm and orderly response during an epidemic in which countless lives could be at stake requires that the president be a reliable public messenger” The paper went on to say “For three and a half years Mr Trump has repeatedly proved an unreliable narrator on a range of subjects…In his response to the coronavirus Mr Trump has made inaccurate or questionable claims twice misstating the number of Americans infected with the virus and insisting that it ‘miraculously goes away’ when warmer spring weather arrives — a prediction that health experts have said is premature” The   portrayed a president mostly interested in promoting himself “We really think we’ve done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum And again we’ve had tremendous success — tremendous success beyond what people would have thought” And “We’re doing great Other countries have not been doing great And “So far we’ve done a great job” The Post also noted that Trump blamed a 2000point decline in the Dow now down over 3000 points in part on the prospect that a Democrat meaning Bernie Sanders might win the White House But the campaign has been going on for a year Some criticism of the administration is inevitable and actually healthy But some of the attacks are so reflexive that it seems those hostile to Trump have simply switched their focus from Russia to Ukraine to the coronavirus Any president has to walk a fine line in a public emergency careful not to scare people or spook the markets while also offering a realistic assessment of the threat and the country’s ability to respond It does make you wonder though Is there any threat to America big enough that it doesn’t become mired in perpetual partisanship And isn’t that a kind of sickness"},

some members to cast votes on behalf of others under their explicit instruction is unconstitutional House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif Minority Whip Steve Scalise RLa and Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney RWyo lambasted the proxy voting plan during a press conference along with a handful of other members The House Republicans announced a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif on Tuesday over the proxy voting systems constitutionality Whatever the Democrats propose to bring up cannot become law because it is unconstitutional McCarthy said For more than 231 years never have we seen a proxy vote on the floor of the House This challenges the Constitution only to protect and empower a speaker It violates the Constitution its a dereliction of duty of its members McCarthy accused Democrats of having different standards for themselves than for the American people They are seeking to keep many members away from the Capitol – under a voting plan aimed at protecting members staff and their families from the coronavirus – as states around the country reopen after lockdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus In California were opening up churches were opening up hair salons he said The only place that hasnt been opening is here on the Capitol inside the House The proxy voting plan which allows members to send a letter to the House clerk giving another member the permission to vote in their stead with explicit instructions on how to vote was passed as part of a House resolution that also set up standards for remote committee hearings earlier this month The special provisions could be renewed or modified for the remainder of the congressional term that ends in January McCarthy added that the proxy setup could serve as a precedent for other unlikely scenarios which would be absurd and unfair If the Democrats are successful in allowing a proxy vote to make their own rules what stops them from making a rule that only certain people can vote or certain members can not have a full vote a half vote he asked Nothing McCarthy also cited comments from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy questioning the constitutionality of proxy voting saying it is unlikely the Senate would take up measures passed by the House via a proxy vote The Constitution requires a physical quorum to do business McConnell said last week “Any House member has a right to demand an inperson attendance check The Democrats’ new rule says one person may mark himself and ten others present even if they are nowhere in sight A flatout lie There will be enormous Constitutional questions around anything the House does if they fail to demonstrate a real quorum but plow ahead anyhow” Rep Mike Johnson RLa listed off language from the Constitution including that Congress shall assemble that a majority of each chamber shall constitute a quorum and that members of Congress will be immune from being arrested during their attendance of a session But Democrats are likely to question that argument because the Constitution allows the chambers to set their own rules and the House and Senate regularly do business without a physical quorum McConnells comments on proxy voting for example took place with just himself and one other Senator on the floor The chambers can also pass legislation via unanimous consent or voice vote without a physical quorum present as long as no member objects That is the detail McCarthy leaned on when pushed about Congress habit of getting things done with less than half of its members in the room Because anybody can object he said responding to a question about passing bills via unanimous consent Democrats have downplayed the idea that proxy voting is something wildly outside of Congress norms House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer DMd has compared the change to a previous move by the House to move from an oral roll call of all its members to electronic voting in the chamber in 1973 The House conducts most roll call votes that way today The House has never allowed proxy voting on the floor but did permit it in committee until 1995 The Senate still allows proxy voting in committee today Cheney said that some remote business could be possible but said that Democrats were taking advantage of the situation for partisan gain She did not elaborate on how letting some members cast ballots on behalf of others under explicit instruction to vote as the other members say would help Democrats over Republicans Cheney also said a report published by House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern DMass had good suggestions for how to do business during the pandemic and noted that the report said the proxy voting could set the chamber up for a legal challenge  as is now happening with Republicans Tuesday lawsuit She appeared open to remote voting instead of proxy voting but that option presents its own Pandoras Box of issues when it comes to cybersecurity and making sure each members vote is counted accurately On the specific legislation that is up for consideration via proxy vote Scalise said Democrats should halt action on a renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was set for a vote on Wednesday before President Trump Tuesday night urged Republicans to vote against it the Department of Justice came out against the bill itself and an amendment that was set for a Wednesday vote and McCarthy also turned against the legislation I would urge the Democrats to pull that bill Because even if it were to pass  it would only  pass with proxy votes meaning the constitutionality of this program would be questioned for a program thats already got its own taint on it Scalise said Scalise also cited alleged abuses of the FISA program as reasons why Congress should take more time considering the legislation McCarthy in urging Pelosi to continue to take care of the House of Representatives business in person cited a number of other natural disasters and conflicts during which the body managed to continue to hold inperson voting including the Spanish flu yellow fever the burning of Capitol during the War of 1812 the Civil War and

continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing In 2015 Bidens own DOJ actually concluded that the Officer Darren Wilson acted in selfdefense and after an investigation there they concluded that that shooting was justified By the way it wasnt Biden and Barack or Joe and Barack that implemented police reform and criminal justice reform that would be Donald Trump They had eight years they had Baltimore as well They did nothing And he has also cleared by the way Darren Wilson of doing  wrongdoing by two state prosecutors in their investigation With this one tweet the Biden campaign is merely fueling fire against police officers Over two thousand now injured 14 dead And for another way by the way Bidens statements and stated policies they end up supporting the antipolice anarchists Just listen he never said a good word that Ive heard about police the 99 percent that protect and serve and put their lives on the line for us You know the 911 cops that are going up as everybody went down or the cops that went out in an open ball field against guy in camouflage and hiding with a rifle almost a death sentence but did it anyway And of course we know what happens when those in charge of work to dismantle and demonize law enforcement Well look at the great city of Portland 73 days and counting city council there working to defund the police also and for weeks city leaders refusing to stop violent riots at a federal courthouse downtown Well this weekend rioters struck again torching a police union building Meanwhile in New York City Conrad de Blasio slashing the citys police budget by a billion dollars disbanding the prestigious undercover most successful anticrime unit also teaming up with Governor Cuomo letting violent criminals out of jail with zero bail policies now shootings in New York have nearly doubled over 2019 already as of August 1st surpassed all the shootings a year ago still five months to go Then there is the city of Chicago refusing to prosecute scores of violent perpetrators altogether The Cook County state attorney Kim Foxx has now dismissed more than 25000 felony cases including murder charges and other serious offenses Thats 35 percent more dismissals than her predecessor As a result yeah murders are up 55 percent shootings up 45 percent and just this weekend mobs of criminals looting vandalizing store after store after store in Chicagos famous Magnificent Mile area The carnage and chaos was completely out of control By the way think those stores are going to rebuild and come back One individual ramming a car into a business to gain access and as you can see the most iconic neighborhoods now in downtown Chicago have descended into absolute anarchy like all these other cities run by the liberal Democrats for decades All told 13 police officers injured in the mayhem two people shot 38 others across the city and what is being described as a living nightmare Of course others are now calling it a war zone Here with a full report from Chicago is WFLD reporter Tia Ewing is with us Tia whats the latest there TIA EWING FOX 32 CHICAGO REPORTER Well Hannity you are running off some of the statistics here in the city of Chicago We are actually running outside of a police district about a mile away from downtown You mention the chaos you mention the disruption a mile away is where that destruction is This is a protest that has been led by Black Lives Matter many of these people are protesting the more than 100 people that were arrested for looting in the city of Chicago You cant see it but at the front door of this police station there is a sign and in fact we did get a chance to speak to someone that is promoting the looting because of what has happened in the city of Chicago in terms of reparations in terms of previous crimes that were done at the hands of Chicago police officers This is at least what they are saying but we have heard from the mayor that is encouraging the Cook County states attorneys office to charge the people that have looted that have destroyed the businesses for the second time around We have to make sure that is known but this is not the first time that this has happened in the city of Chicago At the end of May we had severe looting throughout the city not just downtown also widespread in the city of Chicago Many of those people were released without being charged So this time around it is believed that many of those people did not learn a lesson and came back again for a second time last night Widespread destruction throughout the city and again over 100 people arrested in all of this chaos In terms of the Chicago Police Department roughly 13 officers have been injured and even more people arrested with all of this said and done Live from the city of Chicago for you Tia Ewing FOX 32 News Hannity Ill send it back to you HANNITY All right Stay safe out there Thank you And well have more in my monologue in a moment First joining us with reaction to our top story FOX News contributor Dan Bongino FOX News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera Geraldo lets go to what the attorney general called it this weekend urban guerrilla warfare driven by the lust for power and these riots are organized by Antifa to form this new warfare The president referring I think rightly so at this point now people have been shot murdered and killed to call a war zone And now this  you know they literally turning down  tearing down the city and Joe Biden is not standing up to the 99 percent of good cops that are trying to do their job that are being defunded and putting handcuffs on them GERALDO RIVERA FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT AT LARGE You know Sean theres a couple of different things going on I agree with the attorney general who I think helped save this nation when he stuck up for the president and said he realized what people have done to this poor man during his campaign during his time as presidentelect and in the first three years of his term in office they went after him and tried to kill him Thats part of it The urban guerrilla warfare Antifa and all the rest of that I get that But what you have and I think that what is absolutely miss we see it in Chicago The miracle mile gets hit and now people are paying attention to Chicago The same day Sunday 40 people were shot in Chicago four were killed including a teenager In DC in that incident where someone with a weapon was killed or was shot rather shot outside the White House by the White House fence you pay attention to whats happening in DC also in DC yesterday 20 were shot including a 17yearold bearded one was killed 11 of the 20 shot were women I mean there is an urban civil war theres a ghetto civil war going on here and no one is paying attention unless youre watching your show and this channel It is obscene whats happening HANNITY These are fellow Americans Kids are being shot and killed I mean this is  you know at what point if its 40 50 60 70 people shot we have lets see 1yearolds murdered 7yearolds murdered 8 yearolds murdered 19yearolds murdered Dan Bongino I will go to you And I listen to Joe Biden and I dont care how many interviews that Jill Biden gives saying hes a moderate He is not a moderate on this and is not defending the rights of states and cities the obligation to protect their citizenry Why is he offering and aiding and abetting this DAN BONGINO FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Yeah And Sean Im glad you speak about it this way because I think you get it and I think mother commentators dont I see this attitude in other places where they say oh its Chicago whatever let it burn and let them fix it themselves No No lets not do that Ill never forget being a street cop As a rookie you get the foot post a lot and I was in New York which was a really busy precinct and had a crime problem lets be candid OK And people would come out good folks who live in these really broken high crime areas and Ive said this before in the show theyd say please do something about this guy on the corner slinging the drugs Hes bothering our kids he is scaring everybody and then comes out with guns all the time I mean these are American citizens Sean imprisoned in their own neighborhoods like they are gulags We cant just forfeit major American city And let me make another point here as well about Biden because this is important There is no election in the history of the United States where Im the chaos candidate has been a winning message OK Joe Biden is the chaos candidate for this reason The Democrats are selling him like oh hes a harmless empty vessel Uncle Joe lunch bucket Joe Sean dont ever forget the golden rule of politics people are policy and the people Joe Biden surrounds him with as youve been pointing out every night are radicals serious chaos radicals AOC Bernie Sanders these are real people hes chosen folks Joe Biden is not an empty vessel Thats the problem Hes a parrot Hes a parent for these chaos people hes surrounded himself with who will destroy your bank account your house and the safety of your neighborhood HANNITY You know Geraldo you know you always try to be the fair guy but thats not a Democrat that I recognize I mean Joe Lieberman wasnt radical enough for the Democratic Party He was their vice presidential candidate in 2000 RIVERA They have made a stone cold decision to ignore the mayhem to ignore the murder to ignore the absolute chaos and anarchy Theyve made a decision and theyve communicated that decision to their allies in the media so if you watch the other channels you wont see the rioting You want see the looting And even in the report that we showed from FOX 32 you heard in the background they were justifying the rape of the Miracle Mile in terms of social justice and reparations This is absolute insanity We condoned the destruction of the great city and the terrorizing  I have friends in Chicago weve talked to them today they are terrorized now Their property values are plummeting They justify it  the Black Lives Matter and allies and the Democrats their biggest ally talking about the slavery in 1619 and thats why they robbed the Dior store or busted in the windows thats why they just got 40 people because of social justice and inequities in the past Thats why in DC 11 women could get shot yesterday There is  there is an absolute perversion thats going on They do it in the name of winning an election We are going to lose a country Were going to lose a country  HANNITY Just call it what it is People take it out of context the looting the rioting and you know basically just destroying businesses The businesses arent coming back What about the people that work there But Im out of time Thank you both Now we turn our attention to the swamp in DC Democrats are once again playing politics with your livelihood Now for weeks President Trump is working overtime Why To help people that are unemployed continue to get coronavirus funding so that their unemployment doesnt run out And guess what Congress is nowhere to be found PelosiSchumer stonewalling these negotiations for over four weeks at every turn Remember in May they held it up at that point and people needed help the most They wanted a massive 3 trillion stimulus and now theyre not willing to pass anything Excuse me And they were holding out for immigration reform elections reform what about putting the people of this country first and helping them now And by the way its always for them about politics This is all about 2020 Its not about the ability of men and women and families to put food on their table They obviously dont care about you or your life or your family They only care about oh beating the crap out of Donald Trump in 85 days And unlike Schumer Pelosi this president well hes not willing to sacrifice your quality of life for an election And so late last week the president announced his administration will extend coronavirus relief benefits their executive action And needless to say Democrats are shocked theyre outraged Well hell would have frozen over if we would have to wait for their insane demands Take a look BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REP NANCY PELOSI DCALIF SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE What the president did I agree with the Republican senator said it was unconstitutional slop What he said hes going to do the  its undermining Social Security and Medicare So these are illusions SEN CHUCK SCHUMER DNY MAJORITY LEADER These executive orders are going to be minimal at best I called them paltry or three words that Ive used which now seem to be in the currency are unworkable narrow and scanty These executive orders are just being more or less regarded at best as ineffective and laughed out at worst HILLARY CLINTON FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE So yes it was a stunt most likely unconstitutional He doesnt really have the authority to do it he tried but he sent a signal to voters END VIDEO CLIP HANNITY I have a great idea sue Try and stop the president from extending unemployment benefits and assistance to Americans in trouble I dare all three of you Now despite their phony feigned indignation Democrats oh all of a sudden they want to negotiate The president tweeting today oh so now Schumer and Pelosi want to make a deal amazing how it works isnt it Now where have they been for the last four weeks when they were quote hardliners and only wanted bailout money for a Democraticrun states and cities that are failing so badly By the way dont let your congressman and senator pay out that money They know my phone number the president said Anyway joining us with reaction White House press secretary Ari Fleischer Every single time there has been need an aide this is the worst pandemic since 1918 Democrats play politics Now the president called their bluff I dare them to sue the president to try to stop the extension of unemployment benefits LAUGHTER FLEISCHER Yeah there are two things going on here Sean One the president has actually pulled off a very clever jiujitsu You know normally the Democrats come after these things and Republicans talk and act like a bunch of accountants and bookkeepers Well we cant pay these people who are hurting we cant help them theres just no way we can do this And we sound like were not people with compassion The president turned all that around with his executive order didnt he Now the other factor is its illegal But dont forget it was the Democrats who defended Barack Obama when he used Obamacare money that was not appropriated by Congress to pay subsidies to insurance companies That was not part of the law Obama did it anyway and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer defended that same thing Unappropriated money moved around by the executive branch So I think President Trump is actually done something pretty smart here and it puts him in a good negotiating position on unemployment benefits HANNITY The race to me has changed dramatically Youve been saying the president needs to be active out front as it relates to coronavirus Were now seeing the flattening of the curve in Texas Arizona Florida for example and now were seeing the same pattern drop off soon hopefully the precipitous dropoff so that being checked the president helping those in need during this time thats checked And Id also argue that the president has literally dialed in on not only corona but the economy and everything else that actually matters And by the way compare that to the lack of law and order Democrats FLEISCHER Heres what the Democrats have to fear If the cases of corona continued to go down in the way they have they spiked on July 17th at 75000 Today they were less than 50000 They dropped by 33 percent If that trend continues and corona is no longer the front and center worry that the American people have and the presidents numbers start to move up on handling it this race resets And if the issue is public safety if the issue is their cities are burning people are rioting you cant shop Youre not safe moms arent safe That turns the race around and the president already has the advantage on the economy Those two issues alone can win this election for Donald Trump I submit Sean he still has to keep his foot on the gas on corona throughout the month of August Do not let up on the gas continue to show what youre doing as president about corona and do it every day HANNITY How damaging it is that Biden took this hard left turn radical far left turn FLEISCHER Yeah Ill dispute you a little bit here on this Sean The Democrat Party particularly the mayors have taken a far left turn Biden at least to his credit said the people engaging in violence should be arrested and prosecuted He didnt go all the way on that Now Id like to see some more on that CROSSTALK FLEISCHER  condemning the people who engaged in violence HANNITY Can I gently disagree with you FLEISCHER And Id like to see him and other Democratic leaders speak out against them Go right ahead HANNITY But hes originally said the police have become the enemy and then said yeah were going to reallocate the funds or redirect them Thats defund FLEISCHER Thats right HANNITY And then he adopted Bolshevik Bernie and this pledge trillions to AOCs New Green Deal Thats pretty hard left FLEISCHER He did but I believe in full context for everybody and it is appropriate to say at his news conference he did draw the distinction between those who riot and loot and say they should be prosecuted Others wish it away as a subs not a serious violation of the law So I was heartened to hear that by Biden But on the rest of it the problem Biden has its still fundamental He is a Trojan horse without a backbone Sean He is the lefts leading voice that they want to put inside Washington and then AOCs come out from the inside once hes in power and that Nancy Pelosis because hes weak I dont know that Biden can adhere to any of the positions he holds Hes walked away from how many of them already HANNITY Ari Fleischer always great to have you When we come back Well AfricanAmerican leaders are warning he will lose the election if he does not pick an AfricanAmerican female to be his VP Lawrence Jones our 2020 correspondent investigative reporter out on the streets of New York asking people about this and also about the insulting comments made by Biden last week And Larry and Leo straight ahead COMMERCIAL BREAK HANNITY All right The corrupt the ever confused Joe Biden expected to announce his VP pick this week and AfricanAmerican leaders are warning Biden that he will quote lose the election if he does not pick an AfricanAmerican female running mate And today our very own Lawrence Jones asked New Yorkers hes our 2020 correspondent on the ground our investigative reporter all things 2020 Lawrence joins us Hes literally right now in the streets of New York City LAWRENCE JONES FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Good evening Sean Its 84 days until the election and seems like the former vice president cant get out of his own way suggesting that black voters arent diverse enough Well now 100 black male leaders Are saying they will not support the former vice president unless he picks a black female as his vice presidential candidate We talked to New Yorkers today This is what they had to say BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JONES What do you think about him saying that black people all think alike versus Latinos are more diverse UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Black people all think alike JONES Yeah thats what Joe Biden said UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Thats his thinking JONES Thats his thinking UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE Thats his thinking JONES How does that make you feel UNIDENTIFIED MALE At first I winced I was like you know here we another you know white man whos you know has some antiquated views JONES Yeah that was after he had already said UNIDENTIFIED MALE That was after he said what he said If you dont vote for me youre black JONES You dont vote for me youre not black UNIDENTIFIED MALE Yeah yeah JONES A 100 black men wrote a letter today and they said that in order for them to support Joe Biden they want a black female to be the VP What are your thoughts on that UNIDENTIFIED MALE I dont think its the time to try to hold withhold our votes or to try to leverage it in such a way that its still going to remain a detriment UNIDENTIFIED MALE I feel that it might be a form of affirmative action and whatever and I have no problem with that thats cool END VIDEO CLIP JONES Sean as we reported earlier in the year that the progressive side of the Democratic Party would not just take Joe Biden that theyre going to vote their conscience and right now he still trying to sway them Back to you Sean HANNITY All right Lawrence Jones thank you our 2020 correspondent on the ground and investigative reporter Joining us with reaction civil rights attorney Leo Terrell nationally syndicated radio talk show Larry Elder Leo I dont know maybe if it was Donald Trump I dont think they would have forgotten for example praising the former Klansman that filibustered the Civil Rights Act or that was again as it relates to segregation integration of schools saying he doesnt want his kids in a racial jungle or the predators comment or the fact that I dont see this policy lifted anybody out of any property or created any jobs LEO TERRELL CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY Youre absolutely right Sean But let me just Im really upset about this stupid letter First of all Trump is going to win the election regardless of who they picked Secondly these guys are not black leaders Theyre not black leaders at all The letter is racist It assumes that a black candidate is qualified based on race The letter is also offensive Why Because again it assumes that blacks are all going to vote for a black candidate Larry and I and others are not going to vote for this candidate Joe Biden A million black voted for Trump Hell probably get 2 million this year The letter is also offensive You know why Because it assumes another fact that these candidates are qualified For example Karen Bass is a Fidel Castro sympathizer Kamala Harris she defied federal court orders and put more blacks in jail than Joe Bidens 1994 crime bill So these candidates are unqualified and more importantly blacks do not think is a monolithic group HANNITY Larry LARRY ELDER SALEM RADIO HOST Well I wonder if the people that sign that letter would be happy if Joe Biden picked Condoleezza Rice or Star Parker as his running mate Look the reason all this pressure is on Joe Biden is because of the insulting comments hes been making recently He told Charlamagne Tha God youre not really black if you dont want to support me He said theres no real diversity in the black community And this is up on him saying that he was arrested trying to visit Nelson Mandela He wasnt For decades he says as a teenager worked to integrate restaurants and movie theaters in Delaware He didnt He says the NAACO has endorsed him every single race theyve endorsed him in no race And so thats why hes had this pressure He is about two gaffes away Sean from announcing Al Sharpton or Maxine Waters as his running mate thats the pressure hes under in order to keep to keep that monolithic black vote without which he cannot win CROSSTALK HANNITY Well I hope  Leo TERRELL There was a very famous man who said you judge a person by the content of his character not by the color of his or her skin And guess what these extremist socialist Democrats are doing They are playing the race card with black people Its insulting HANNITY Larry ELDER Well again this is Democrats 101 Ayanna Pressley one of the  one of the Squad members said we dont need any brown faces who dont want to be a brown voice we dont need any black faces that dont want to be a black voice This is how they roll If you dont think a certain kind of way youre not really black Harry Reid once said I dont understand how any Hispanic would ever be a Republican Thats how these guys think If you are Hispanic and youre Republican you are a Theo Taco if youre black and youre a Republican youre an Uncle Tom TERRELL Hey P Diddy P Diddy  CROSSTALK HANNITY Heres my question though Larry does this change  in other words historically the AfricanAmerican vote goes Democratic Record after record low back low unemployment largest commitment to historically black colleges  ELDER Right HANNITY  opportunity zones criminal justice reform police reform does that help President Trump ELDER Right TERRELL It helps President Trump tremendously because its one of the reasons why Im voting for Trump Again what the Democrats do not want to hear is that Trump has done more in three years than what Obama and Biden have done in eight years and the problem is this black voters are wise enough to know just because you have a D in your name youre not a good candidate And by the way P Diddy I didnt select as a black leader Those 100 guys if I wouldve that letter I would have tore it up I would have tore that letter up If anyone were to ask me to sigh Id tear it up HANNITY All right Leo gets the last word tonight Larry Leo good to see you I still stand by this needs to be a show right here on the FOX News Channel When we come back well former White House physician Dr Ronnie Jackson weighs in on whether Biden should take that cognitive exam the one that President Trump took Oh and then were talking about it at the top of the show tonight fake news HumptyDumpty yet to be named potato heads making a ridiculous comment well the most recent one Well thats next Also big news on the deep state Lindsey Graham with new information that could turn the Durham investigation right on its head in the direction it shouldve gone a while ago straight ahead COMMERCIAL BREAK HANNITY Another disastrous week of interviews for Joe Biden last week as he added to his long of just confusion and blunders on the campaign and hes barely campaigning And anyway Biden is continuing to hide in his basement bunker as they try to protect him from himself You have fake news CNN they continue their long track record of just lying and being a propagandist network basically a cult for all things Democratic socialist and staterun television or as Humpty Dumpty and the soon to be named Mr Potato Head actually suggested yesterday left wing media the mob I call them is not dedicated to damaging President Trump OK thats just laughable Take a look BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE When you see entire media companies existing to tear down Joe Biden is there an equivalent of that in the left tearing down from UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE There really isnt END VIDEO CLIP HANNITY Thats all they do over there Pretty much 247 Pretty much  lets see  self lack of selfawareness whatever phrase you want to use and of course conservative medias attack where to blame the fact that Biden has one blunder after another thats kind of laughable Here with reaction former White House physician congressional candidate Dr Ronny Jackson senior advisor for the TrumpPence campaign Mercedes Schlapp Now Dr Ronny Jackson you administered this Montreal cognitive assessment for the president Number one the media has portrayed this as being simple and easy Is it an easy test as they say Because thats not what Ive heard and read DR RONNY JACKSON FORMER WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN Well Ill tell you Sean if its so easy I dont know why they just want to submit Biden so he can get it over with right Its not an easy test Most people cant score 30 out of 30 like President Trump Thats a little bit more difficult to do But the reality is its a screening test for cognitive disability and if you dont have any cognitive disability you should be able to pass the test And you know Ive heard Biden talk about how simple it is and  but you know if its really that simple and he really thinks that way he should just submit to the test and just take the test HANNITY And theres no fudging results My understanding is when that test was administered this is it you get one shot What you get will be reported JACKSON Thats right its pretty straightforward I mean its not  its very objective So I gave the president the test and he did really well on it And you know I just  Ive said this before but there was absolutely positively no clinical indication to do that test for President Trump We did that test only because the far left and the liberal press were relentless in their insistence that the president was mentally unfit to be president He had to have some kind of testing done So I basically talked to the president and he agreed to do it and he did and he did well on it HANNITY Let me ask you this question Were all watching Joe Biden even compared Joe Biden from just when he was vice president where he is now I see somebody physically frail and weak somebody that constantly loses his train of thought that constantly seems confounded and confused Do you share my observations and how do you interpret that medically speaking Im not a doctor and Im not going to begin to play one on radio or TV JACKSON Absolutely And Im not saying this as President Bidens physician  or Vice President Bidens physician Ive not examined him and I didnt take care of them at the White House But I will tell you Im saying this is an emergency medicine physician and a concerned citizen I dont think that hes mentally fit right now to be our president And I do think that you know hes made  hes made gaffes throughout his time as vice president but these are different These are issues where hes going to a thought  he gets right in the middle of a thought and he just completely loses where hes at and cant get himself out of it HANNITY Let me go back to  Im sorry go ahead sir JACKSON No go ahead HANNITY Lets go back to last week Lets play the  listen remember this is like a little baby campaign This isnt a real campaign with the real rigors of a campaign This is OK poked my head out of the bunker for an hour or two and then go back to sleep and drink hot cocoa and take a nappy Lets watch it from last week BEGIN VIDEO CLIP INTERVIEWER But please clarify specifically have you taken a cognitive test JOE BIDEN DPRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE No I havent taken a test Why the hell would I take a test Come on man Thats like saying you  before you got in this program you take a test where youre taking cocaine or not what do you think huh Are you a junkie INTERVIEWER What do you say to President Trump who brags about his test and makes your mental state an issue for voters BIDEN Well if he cant figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion I dont know what the hell hes talking about Did you watch that   look come on man I know youre trying to goad me but I mean Im so forwardlooking to have an opportunity to sit with the president or stand with the president in debates There could be plenty of time And by the way as I joke with them you know I shouldnt say it  Im going to say something I dont  I probably shouldnt say Anyway I am  I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical and mental  my physical as well as my mental  fitness and to  you know to make a judgment about who I am END VIDEO CLIP HANNITY Mercedes come on man You need a cocaine test Are you a junkie Doesnt know the difference between an elephant and a lion and Id put my physical and mental  whats that word again Fitness fitness MERCEDES SCHLAPP TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER Come on Sean seriously You know were talking about Joe Biden who is dazed and confused and obviously you have the media outlets like CNN who cover up for his gaffes I mean you just display just by showing that video alone shows that he can barely put a sentence together as to why hes so scared of even going forward with a fourth debate with President Trump President Trump is ready to debate Joe Biden Bidens strategy is stay as long as possible in the basement Hes got some of his advisor who support that That is not a sustainable strategy And the American people deserve to know who Joe Biden really is and thats the most unfortunate part about this whole situation right now is that for Joe Biden all we know right now is that he has moved farther and farther to the left and joined the Squad and Bernie Sanders in that socialist manifesto AUDIO GAP HANNITY There should not be one vote cast until these two debate and not one vote cast until we find out what went wrong with the deep state and abuse of power and corruption until we get to the bottom of that Thank you both When we come back pretty unbelievable Huge breaking news Lindsey Graham pointing out the FBI absolutely lied to US senators about the Steele dossier and we have the evidence next straight ahead COMMERCIAL BREAK HANNITY Now even more smoking gun evidence tonight of the FBIs massive abuse of power corruption New documents revealing not only did the FBI mislead the FISA court about reliability for the dirty dossier that Hillary paid for but they spread the same lies to the Senate Intel Committee well a year after they knew actually a year and a half after they knew it was all false Now Senator Lindsey Graham is sending a letter directly to the FBI Director Wray and asking for the details surrounding just exactly how that briefing was arranged and who provided it Here with reaction Senator Lindsey Graham You look at the timeline they knew in August of 2016 reconfirmed in January of 2017 and Comey signed the first one in October of 2016 but told Trump it was salacious and unverified but on the FISA application said verified SEN LINDSEY GRAHAM RSC SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN Well the main thing is in January of 2017 they found the Russian subsource who is not based in Russia He was a Steele employee here in America used to work for the Brookings Institute And in January and March of 2017 he basically told the FBI that the dossier is a bunch of bar talk hearsay never corroborated take it all with a grain of salt and they continue to use it against Carter Page to get a warrant in April and June But heres what we found Horowitz found this not me Horowitz came up to me during a briefing about the Carter Page fiasco and said we found something you need to look at Somebody in the Horowitz world ph an investigator found a briefing paper prepared by the FBI in 2018 to brief the Senate Intel Committee Apparently somebody on the Intel Committee and the Senate wanted to be briefed about reliability of the subsource We found that briefing paper and they told the Senate Intel Committee the same story they told the FISA court They did not tell them the truth about the Russian subsource disavowing the dossier And I want Christopher Wray to account for how that happened This happened on Wrays watch On Wrays watch the Senate Intel Committee was briefed about the dossier and the Russian subsource in the same fashion that the FISA court was briefed very misleading HANNITY Thats called premeditated fraud against the FISA court words that this audience is familiar with because I use the same language on what they did GRAHAM Yes HANNITY Let me be very clear here So what youre saying is that the FBI knew early on that this was bogus It was not only not confirmed or as they say at the top of the FISA warrant you know again this was the bulk of information for the FISA warrant verified it was unverifiable and they knew it to be false But they kept going with it anyway which meant they drag the country through hell knowing it was BS Why are they being held accountable Senator GRAHAM Yeah HANNITY And Director Wray why isnt he  why isnt he cleaning up the premier law enforcement agency in the world GRAHAM So lets put a fine point on what you just said How could it be that in February and March of 2018 over a year after the FBI interviewed the Russian subsource saying the dossier was garbage that the FBI briefed the Senate Intel Committee in 2018 saying basically its a reliable document Who put that briefing together Christopher Wray needs to tell me how that briefing was set up for the Senate Intel Committee I want to know who gave the briefing I want to know who prepared the briefing memo The briefing memo was a complete fabrication  HANNITY Well Senator thats called  GRAHM  of what the subsource said HANNITY Thats called  thats called the process crime Didnt they have predawn raids for Paul Manafort and Roger Stone for process crimes and lying to Congress And didnt we already have a referral for these guys lying to Congress GRAHAM This is really unbelievable the double standards here by the media but what Im tell your listeners that a year after they knew the Russian dossier was no longer reliable they told the same lies to Congress not just the court as a completely new front of legal liability and Im going to find out what happened HANNITY Well thats why your testimony from Rod Rosenstein and Sally Yates is key Knowing what they know now neither of them wouldve signed those warrants Great work Senator Graham Thank you GRAHAM You got it HANNITY Straight ahead COMMERCIAL BREAK HANNITY All right As we continue if you havent

to deal with their own ballooning deficits McConnell made the comments on The   Show against the backdrop of governors imploring the federal government for urgent fiscal help and congressional Democrats seeking to work with the Trump administration to provide it McConnell instead said he would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route an option that is not currently available to them  as he called for a pause in such aid from Washington I mean we all represent states We all have governors regardless of party who would love to have free money McConnell said in response to a question on what the federal government should do to help states in tricky financial situations And that’s why I said yesterday we’re going to push the pause button here because I think this whole business of additional assistance for state and local governments needs to be thoroughly evaluated McConnell then mentioned that many states are struggling with funding pensions or similar programs saying theres not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations After Hewett weighed in criticizing liberal states that racked up significant liabilities McConnell said he favored letting states declare bankruptcy as local governments are allowed to Yeah I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route It saves some cities McConnell said And there’s no good reason for it not to be available McConnells comments come one day after the Senate advanced an interim stimulus package to restock funds in the Paycheck Protection Program PPP and address a handful of other priorities He initially sought to have the bill include only funding for the PPP but Democrats held up the legislation until they could extract concessions from the majority leader Though McConnell ceded to some of their requests he kept funding for state governments out of the bill which is expected to see a vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday Democrats are disappointed that the Administration has not agreed to more funding for state tribal and local governments on the front lines of this crisis who desperately need an infusion of funds to pay the essential workers who keep us safe House Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCalif and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer DNY said in a joint statement Tuesday However we are pleased that the President has committed to addressing this critical priority in CARES 2 and will work with urgency to see that this commitment is fulfilled they

chairman of the National Governors Association issued a statement on April 11 pleading with Congress to appropriate 500 billion for state governments as they deal with the economic and fiscal consequences of the coronavirus pandemic In the absence of unrestricted fiscal support of at least 500 billion from the federal government states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to critically important services all across this country hampering public health the economic recovery and  in turn  our collective effort to get people back to work Hogan said in a statement that also touted the work of governors to fight the coronavirus pandemic McConnells comments Wednesday were not the first time allowing states to declare bankruptcy has been discussed In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis   allowing hurting states to reorganize in bankruptcy But Republicans at the time squashed the idea even as they also panned the possibility of the federal government bailing states out While bankruptcy for states may seem like an attractive alternative to state bailouts there are significant constitutional concerns that should be addressed by congressional hearings former Rep Lamar Smith RTexas   at the time McConnell in his comments with Hewitt noted that states are likely to agree that bankruptcy shouldnt be the first option My guess is their first

{"6744": "President Trump is acting properly and justifiably to temporarily suspend immigration to the US for at least 60 days in the face of the   pandemic He announced the action in a tweet Monday night and elaborated Tuesday on the executive order he plans to sign this week In his Monday tweet   wrote that he was acting “in light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens” “By pausing immigration we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs” the president said at his daily pandemic news conference Tuesday “We must first take care of the American worker” As someone who knows the immigration system better than most I understand why the president’s executive order is both legal and in our national interest Members of the European Union Canada Mexico and even China are among nations around the world that have taken steps to limit foreigners entering their countries because of the pandemic It’s simple common sense to keep people who might add to the spread of a deadly disease from crossing our border – this is why other nations have done the same thing  President Trump has rightly put a lot of blame for the pandemic on China which failed to stop the spread of the new respiratory disease COVID19 – caused by the novel coronavirus – soon after it first surfaced in the Chinese city of Wuhan China tried to cover up the existence of the disease and how widespread it was and falsely stated that it could not be readily transmitted among people Any president of the United States has broad authority to restrict entry into the United States – a point the US Supreme Court affirmed in upholding President Trump’s controversial travel ban on some foreigners in 2018 That power is perhaps never greater than during a public health emergency Despite what those on the left want us to believe the president’s temporary suspension of immigration isn’t about immigration at all It’s about protecting the health of the American people from a virus that has tragically taken the lives of over 45000 people in the US and stricken more than 824000 And those are just the confirmed cases – public health experts tell us there are undoubtedly more people infected and killed by the coronavirus in the US With such a serious pandemic going on does it really make sense to allow more people to come into the US right now  Of course not Also the left cannot continue to demand social distancing and delaying the return to work for some while at the same time supporting more people coming to the US now It makes zero sense President Trump also acted to protect employment opportunities for American workers With over 20 million people applying for unemployment insurance payments due to the closure of many businesses why should we bring more people into the US to compete for whatever jobs may become available The old saying that immigrants only take jobs that Americans don’t want is just wrong Especially now I have a few friends who are unemployed right now because of the pandemic shutdown and they are delivering pizzas to help make ends meet Americans are begging to work right now We don’t know when everyone may be able to go back to work or how many will lose their jobs permanently because their employers go out of business Doesn’t it make sense to temporarily keep employment opportunities available to our own workforce until we see how this all plays out The president said Tuesday that his executive order may be broadened as we move forward That would be a great opportunity to expand the order to hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and guest workers such as hightech H1B visa recipients – skilled foreign workers in the US for a limited time – as one example Even before this pandemic these types of temporary workers displaced many US citizens out of goodpaying jobs It would make sense to expand the executive order to include such workers quickly It is incredible to watch the president’s Democratic opponents in Congress and the antiTrump media continually attacking him because he wants to protect America and our health safety and work opportunities This exactly what any president should do Recent polls show that most Americans believe that the threat of infectious diseases spreading in the US is now our biggest threat And a majority support the types of actions President Trump is taking on immigration in response to the coronavirus pandemic For example About 79 percent of American adults recently said they favor a temporary pause on immigration into our country according to a USA TodayIpsos poll A new   poll shows that more than 80 percent of adults in our country consider mass immigration a threat 42 percent say a major threat 39 percent say a minor threat A  Rasmussen national survey   that 70 percent of voters agreed that the federal government should place a temporary ban on allowing entry from any other country At a time when many American workers are hurting or out of a job it makes sense to protect jobs for them And not only protect their jobs – protect wages as well A 2017 study by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine found that immigration often hurts the wages of lowskilled and bluecollar workers Another study published in February by the Economist magazine showed that wages in five big metro areas that saw absolute declines in their foreignborn population from 2010 to 2018 rose by 5 percent a year And Harvard University professor George Borjas has found that the arrival of more workers into our country through immigration can depress wages He wrote “Wage trends over the past halfcentury suggest that a 10 percent increase in the number of workers with a particular set of skills probably lowers the wage of that group by at least 3 percent” For any politician or antiTrump news organization to attack our president because he is trying to protect our country our health and our livelihoods is disgraceful Can this nation circle the wagons around our commander in chief while we deal with one of the greatest threats America has ever seen We can respond and beat this pandemic and overcome it as we have overcome other challenges before But unity behind our president is vital We have to fight the coronavirus – not each other"},

that got out of control or was it done deliberately OK Theres a big difference between those two  In either event they should have let us go in You know we asked to go in very early and they didnt want us in I think they were embarrassed  END VIDEO CLIP  BARTIROMO Senator Tom Cotton a Republican from Arkansas first sounded the alarm about China right here on this program months ago  He joins me right now live  And Senator its great to see you this morning Thanks so much for being here  SEN TOM COTTON RAR Good morning Maria  BARTIROMO So you knew very early on and you questioned very early on the origins of this disease And you knew that it likely came from that lab that level four super lab in Wuhan  I want to ask you about what China knew because you and I spoke over the weekend this weekend And I asked you do you think its deliberate  You said you dont have any evidence right now but it should be investigated but we do know what China did once they knew how severe this coronavirus be  Tell us what you think China did  COTTON So Maria I want to distinguish between the origins of the virus and Chinas reactions to the virus  So right now as you say the most plausible explanation supported by literally all of the circumstantial evidence is that the virus originated in one of those two laboratories in Wuhan  All the way back in January it was pretty welldocumented by Chinese scientists that it didnt originate in the food market But wherever it originated Maria we know that the Chinese Communist Party was both criminally negligent and incompetent at first and then deliberately deliberately malevolent in the way they responded to this virus for their own people and the world  As early as the second week of December it was clear that this virus was spreading from person to person By late December it was spreading to doctors in Wuhan hospitals Some doctors were trying to blow the whistle on these facts and the secret police arrived at their doorsteps in the middle of the night  So only after China fessed up to the WHO on December 31 did the world know what was happening Yet still they continued to deny that it was spreading from person to person into midJanuary That allowed millions of people to leave Wuhan  And then finally China continued to pressure the WHO and other countries not to stop international travel from China That meant that hundreds of thousands of persons left China after this virus was spread far outside of Wuhan which allowed the virus to escape Chinas borders and get to the United States and get to Europe and get to essentially every country in the world  I believe that was a deliberate and conscious choice by the Chinese communist leadership because they didnt want to see their relative power and standing in the world decline because this virus was contained within China  BARTIROMO So a deliberate move because they expected this virus to cause economic contraction in China  Tell me what they expected in China and what they didnt want to see from the  they didnt want to happen with the rest of the world being fine  COTTON So Maria again it was obvious by midDecember to Chinese authorities that this virus was highly contagious and very deadly  They also knew that once this virus began to spread outside of Wuhan it would wreak economic havoc throughout China And in fact China had the first contraction in the first quarter of this year since the cultural revolution ended in the 1970s  I believe the Chinese communist leaders when they were aware of those facts by midJanuary made the conscious decision not to explain to the world that it was transmissible between humans not to shut down travel not to ask for American or other kind of international scientific help but to allow this virus to escape their borders because if they were going to suffer an economic contraction they were not going to allow the world to continue to prosper and China be the only country whose economy was declining  They might see an absolute decline in their economy but they refused to see a relative decline especially relative to the United States  BARTIROMO In other words they didnt want to see the Chinese economy contract 20 percent with the rest of the world contracting 2 percent  COTTON Thats exactly right  I mean it was inevitable that we would have economic impacts all around the world because so much of the world has outsourced manufacturing productive capacity to China So it was inevitable if Chinas economy was declining that it would have effects all around the world  But what wasnt inevitable was that we would loss 26 million jobs in America in a month If China had been up front about this virus from the very beginning some studies suggest that they could have reduced the number of cases in China itself by 65 to even 90 percent  Imagine what that would have done for the spread of the virus not only in China but more importantly for us all around the world But once they knew that it was spreading all around China they were not going to take the responsible action of bringing in international scientists and shutting down international air travel  Rather they were going to let the virus escape their borders so the rest of the world would suffer along with China  BARTIROMO So one of the issues that we have spoken about in the past is this intellectual property theft that has been going on for decades  China the Chinese Communist Party continues to steal intellectual property You believe that they are stealing intellectual property right now as we speak  Lets talk a bit about that because the whole world is looking for a vaccine And I wonder is China trying now to come out of this trying to save face look better than the rest of the world while coming up with a vaccine before the United States  Whats happening right now with regards to that kind of science  COTTON Well Maria the Chinese Communist Party has been stealing Americas intellectual property for decades And they arent going to magically stop in the middle of a pandemic  In almost every state in the union there are active cases against Chinese nationals In Arkansas for instance they are accused of having stolen proprietary genomes of our farmers in East Arkansas  But in the middle of a pandemic whats the most valuable intellectual property in the world Its the research that our great laboratories and life science companies are doing on prophylactic drugs therapeutic drugs and ultimately a vaccine  So I have little doubt that the Chinese intelligence services are actively trying to steal Americas intellectual property as it relates to the virus that they unleashed on the world because of course they want to be the country that claims credit for finding those drugs or finding a vaccine and then use it as leverage against the rest of the world  BARTIROMO So I want to ask you about your three pieces of legislation that you have already put out to keep China accountable Im going to get to that in a moment  But just what you just said that is why you believe we shouldnt be giving visas to Chinese students who want to study advanced sciences They want to get into the Gilead Sciences and the Googles of the world to steal that research is that right  COTTON Yes Maria its a scandal to me that we have trained so many of the Chinese Communist Partys brightest minds to go back to China to compete for our jobs to take our business and ultimately to steal our property and design weapons and other devices that can be used against the American people  So I think we need to take a very hard look at the visas that we give the Chinese nationals to come to the United States to study especially at the postgraduate level in advanced scientific and technological fields  If Chinese students want to come here and study Shakespeare and the Federalist Papers thats what they need to learn from America They dont need to learn quantum computing and artificial intelligence from America  BARTIROMO Well theyre certainly making sure that anybody in China is learning the culture of China You make a good point Lets make sure people understand the culture of America  So you have introduced three pieces of legislation And you think bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to America is critical  You also think military spending and the measures there are going to actually keep them accountable as well  Real quick tell me about those pieces of legislation  COTTON So I think most Americans are shocked to learn that so many of our basic drugs are made in China  We need to stop that We need to bring it back to the United States and get it out of China So we would give incentives to companies to build new plants here create more jobs here so we are not dependent on China in a pandemic or even in any kind of health concerns  Second China is continuing even now to take aggressive action throughout the region to break its commitments  Its cracking down on Hong Kong in violations of its commitment to Great Britain when Great Britain returned Hong Kong Its taking aggressive action in the South China Sea We need to invest more in our defense industrial base to offset some of the losses were going to see because of this virus  We need more ships we need more submarines we need more bombers we need more fighters the exact kind of systems that will deter China from aggressive action against the United States and our interests in the Western Pacific and ultimately all around the globe  BARTIROMO And by the way right now they are also capitalizing on the problems were having in this country on meat A couple of meat processing plants have been taken offline Theyre buying all the meat at discounted prices  Thats going to be a problem for the US come next couple of weeks Were going to see a skyrocketing price of meat right  COTTON Yes we have a lot of our biggest processing plants that are going offline Unfortunately that may hit supplies in grocery stores in the weeks ahead  At the meantime China is buying a lot of cutrate protein from the United States just another example of the way they are trying to take advantage of this crisis They are not resting on their laurels  BARTIROMO All right  COTTON Theyre not breathing a sigh of relief They are trying to advance their interests and ambitions all around the world  BARTIROMO All right we will leave it there  Senator do you think they are going to keep their promise to buy the 250 billion of stuff that they promised President Trump in that phase one trade deal  COTTON Let me just say Maria Im skeptical of any promises made by any communists And the Chinese communists dont have a very good record of keeping their promises  And they may not even have the resources to begin with because remember even though the rest of the world is taking a big economic hit China is taking it as well  So I would fall back here to Ronald Reagans maxim of trust but verify  BARTIROMO All that and they lied again on the phase one trade deal  Senator thank you for your great work We appreciate your time this morning Thank you sir  COTTON Thank you Maria  BARTIROMO Senator Tom Cotton joining us there  There is plenty of uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic when it will be safe for the United States to reopen the economy  Ill speak with White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr Birx next right here  Stay with us  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BARTIROMO Welcome back  The president on Friday signing the latest coronavirus relief measure totaling nearly halfatrillion dollars that to benefit small business hospital and national testing  But House Speaker Pelosi is already talking about a fourth bill and proxy voting  Joining me right now is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  Congressman its always great to see you Thank you for being here  I want to get started with the letter that you sent to the speaker Nancy Pelosi to try to get her to push back on this proxy voting as well as to ensure that certain key committees come back to work  Tell us about the letter you sent her and the response you have gotten  REP KEVIN MCCARTHY RCA Well I sent a letter to her last week  She wanted to change 200 years of history So constituents lend their voice to their congresswoman or congressman for two years and want to hold them accountable  What Nancy Pelosi wanted to do was Congress was to be able to hold 200 proxies 200 different votes for members of Congress to make her more powerful in control of the floor Fortunately after my letter and our discussion with her she has pulled back on that  But Congress is essential We have worked through the Civil War World War II and others We need to get to work And just as states wouldnt open up completely at once we need committees to come back in like Armed Services to do the national defense bill  You have appropriators making sure government is funded You could bring oversight back to look at the WHO And the current administration of the WHO is acting not like the World Health Organization but more like the Wuhan health organization  We should actually get the facts and the answers And those committees could come back with not the entire Congress to show that we are working for the American public just as American as we watch these states phase in in a safe healthy manner  BARTIROMO But thats not what she wants right She wants everyone to not come back until May And is that right And is that the plan  MCCARTHY That is the current plan  But after my conversation with the speaker she put together three Republicans and three Democrats myself and the majority leader and others to start working on planning on how we can do this  I dont think you should change the history of how Congress votes to empower one side Congress can work We just proved it We have passed some of the biggest bills in the history of Congress during this pandemic  We can open up in a manner and have committees working They can work in bigger buildings so they have social distancing They can do it in a safe manner while all the members arent there  And we can have product being worked for the American public  BARTIROMO Why is the speaker now talking about November elections must go on She says that the president may try to postpone it  How can we ensure a safe election And lets talk a bit about China That has certainly been the dominant story But a number of your colleagues completely missed China as a threat as they continue to investigate Russia and the ghosts of collusion for years  MCCARTHY Yes lets first talk about this isnt the beginning of Nancy Pelosi the speaker talking about Novembers elections  She brought this up and held up the first CARES Act the act of the more than 2 trillion This is when she wanted to institute  change election law go for the Green New Deal pay for Planned Parenthood  And for every moment these Democrats have tried to held up  held up each bill to play politics with it And I expect her to continue the same But we will move forward with the November election and not try to give advantage to one party or the other but make sure theyre fair  You were correct  BARTIROMO So how  yes  MCCARTHY Maria you were one of the first that was showing what China was doing  I remember Twitter  people on Twitter criticizing you because you were one of the first ones coming out there concerned about the laboratories in Wuhan concerned about was China being honest with the American public  Now we see a  own study by Southampton that had China been honest with the world 95 percent of this never would have happened What China has done has directly led to Americans death And this is where we should have started long ago  BARTIROMO Yes  MCCARTHY And President Trump has been correct about China long before when he was just a candidate about our supply chain  BARTIROMO No youre right  MCCARTHY  when it comes to our pharmaceuticals critical minerals and others  And one thing we should learn from this pandemic is never put ourselves in this position again Look what Japan is doing  BARTIROMO Yes  MCCARTHY Japan is pulling back those companies from China  We should do the same Our allies could as well And we can make the world stronger and never be in this situation again  BARTIROMO Yes you make a great point Thank you for that  The president completely changed the conversation on China  Will there be a fourth stimulus package Congressman What are you looking for in terms of putting in another relief bill even as even McConnell your colleague on the Senate is questioning the debt Now the debt that this country faces is higher than the actual size of the economy 22 trillion  MCCARTHY That is a real fear Every great society has collapsed when they have overextended themselves  We have just passed four bills more than 27 trillion And you combine this with what the Fed is doing thats 7 trillion into the economy  BARTIROMO Thats right  MCCARTHY Lets first look at the results before we want to go back and try to rework another bill  I would listen to the Democrats but this is where their socialism comes out They pick the dollar amount before they even know what needs to be done Lets get this implemented into society Lets let the 7 trillion work Lets look at results before we react to anything else moving forward  BARTIROMO OK we will leave it there  Congressman its great to see you this morning Thank you so much sir  MCCARTHY Thank you Maria  BARTIROMO House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  Several investigations still under way in Congress on the threat China poses to the country including stealing intellectual property  House Intel Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes is here Hes been investigating China since 2011  We will learn what hes uncovered when he comes  next  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BARTIROMO Welcome back  If the US continues to make progress the head of the governments Coronavirus Task Force Vice President Mike Pence says that the crisis could largely be behind us by Memorial Day  This comes as several states begin reopening their economies this week  Joining me right now to talk more about that is Dr Deborah Birx She is the White House coronavirus response coordinator  And Dr Birx its great to have you this morning Thank you so much for joining us  DR DEBORAH BIRX WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR Good morning  BARTIROMO So first let me ask you where are we today with this virus We know what Vice President Pence said What do you say in terms of where we are and what is most important  BIRX Well I think what we have tried to convey to the American people is every metro area is different in where they are in the epidemic  So when you look at New Orleans theyre way on the downside and they have a very low number of cases When you look at Detroit theyre moving on to the downside When you look at Boston and Chicago were still very concerned about the rate of new infections  And at the same time were tracking every county including rural America to look very carefully about any outbreaks that occur at the county level and rural areas And that together is really informing how we work with every governor and every state and local official to really ensure that they have the support that they need  BARTIROMO So I know that you have studied disease for many years across the world  And you look at data all day long Youre getting the very latest data every day 230 in the morning Then youre bringing it studying it analyzing it mining it bringing it to the task force and telling the public about it  Tell me what strikes you most about the data that youre seeing today because I know that you have uncovered and identified some data about people who dont have any symptoms Tell us why thats important And what strikes you most about the data youre looking at today  BIRX I think were getting a lot of information out of these isolated outbreaks that are occurring whether they are occurring in prisons or among essential workers in packing plants or specifically gatherings that came together whether it was a wedding or an event  And when you look at those epidemics it isnt until you start seeing symptomatic groups When you go in and test you find a lot of people had the virus and may not ever develop symptoms And I think were really starting to look at this in a very careful way to understand how we do surveillance  And so in the guidelines that were put out because we could start to see this even a couple of weeks ago we were very careful in the guidelines to recognize two parts of monitoring this epidemic one continuing to diagnose cases  Those are people who come forward with fever or other symptoms but secondly setting up surveillance what we call this actually sentinel monitoring of specific populations that we know may be of greater risk where you want to find those asymptomatic cases earlier longterm care facilities among Native Americans innercity metro areas where there may be multigenerational household to really screen people before they develop symptoms to really understand if the virus is in the community and increasing or decreasing  This is a novel approach We havent had to do this often with respiratory diseases And so were bringing together those two aspects to really have a comprehensive plan working with each and every governor and state and local official to make sure that both components diagnosis and monitoring for the populations at greatest risk simultaneously  BARTIROMO So that means that were going to have to see more antibody testing to understand who is walking around who has it or had it with no symptoms  BIRX And I think that who had it is very important to understand  And you have heard a lot about these antibody tests what we have been working on with CDC and with the FDA because we did this  theres other diseases where we try to find asymptomatic cases whether it be chlamydia or HIV or HPV We know how to do this  And so with an antibody test you often want to do two That increases what we call the specificity and sensitivity of the test to make it more accurate  So we have been waiting  and its why we havent come out with a specific algorithm although we think we will have it by the beginning of this week  to really talk about how you do one test followed by  if youre positive you confirm that with a second test  BARTIROMO I see  BIRX That really increases the  what we call the positive predictive value of that test  BARTIROMO Let me ask you Dr Birx  You have been doing this for so many years on a scientific level Here its a little bit of a new game for you with the politics getting involved right  How difficult has it been in terms of politics getting through all of this Theres controversy over hydroxychloroquine the FDA issuing a warning on Friday that hydroxychloroquine that  this warning about this drug The president is getting slammed for calling it a miracle drug a couple weeks ago  And then of course this week the president tweeted this What is the purpose of having White House news conferences when the lamestream media asks nothing but hostile questions and then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately They get record ratings and the American people get nothing but fake news Not worth the time and effort  Are you going to stop these regular daily press briefings Dr Birx  BIRX Well we  I would say Dr Fauci Dr Redfield and I all come from a place where another disease was highly politicized  And when we were working on the front lines of HIVAIDS and  we understood two things that were absolutely critical communicating early scientific facts because communities can understand them And it gives communities the ability to have knowledge to protect themselves And that is really extraordinary  And then also communicate about what were studying and what were not studying and why And those are in clinical trials and other evidencebased  and any time we hear about something that could be hopeful to let the American people know that were studying that that were  were not leaving any stone unturned to really figure out what can really help the American people  But I think that communication to communities is essential because a knowledgeable community is a protected community And we know thats important And I think we understand that those messages of science and policy need to continue to be brought forward to the American people in a nonpolitical way  BARTIROMO So do you think its best to do the communicating when you have something new to communicate  Or do you think you should be doing these press conferences every day putting the president out there and fielding these questions in some regard that may not have anything to do with the science  BIRX Well every day we discover something new and important  And I think the American people should understand that we had no experience with this virus until a few weeks ago anywhere in the world And starting in January different information started coming in but not in a country like the United States  We are probably the most genetically diverse We have the most different age groups that have not seen this virus before Were a younger country than much of Europe So our outcomes and our knowledge are going to be critical for all the countries moving forward  And we have really been delving into what  why do our younger people have a different course than we saw or have been reported in other countries Our  is it a genetic issue Is it the way we respond to the virus Is it an antibody response to the virus  BARTIROMO OK  BIRX Were uncovering really important pieces  And I just want to acknowledge the health care workers that are in the front line who are getting this information back to us on an everyday basis  BARTIROMO Youre doing it Dr Birx  Thank you so much We appreciate your time this morning Come back soon Thank you  BIRX Thank you  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MARCH 25 2018  REP DEVIN NUNES RCA We actually are running an investigation on many aspects of China at the House Intelligence Committee  And I think most Americans know that China is in fact stealing our intellectual property Theyre spreading globally  END VIDEO CLIP  BARTIROMO That was California Congressman Devin Nunes the ranking member of the House Intel Committee back in 2018 when he was the chairman of the committee when it was becoming more widely known that China was stealing intellectual property gaining technological advantages over the United States  Congressman Devin Nunes joins me right now  And I want to thank you Congressman because ever since I started at FOX I was talking to you a lot And over the first couple of years that Id been here  I have been here six years  but by the time I was here three years or so I was kneedeep in studying the FBI and its wrongdoing the coup to take down Donald Trump and China because of your investigations I was following your investigation  Youre still investigating China You have been doing so since 2011 And now its topic A  What have you learned  NUNES Well the concern that we had back in the beginning of the 2011 2012 was that China was trying to take over the global communications architecture  So we looked into companies like Huawei that were somehow underbidding every company in the world They were giving things away for free  And as we know the Chinese dont do anything for free Thats why then they started  they moved in from communications architecture which I do believe now thats given them a global footprint to listen in and grab communications across the globe and to spy on not only people within the United States but also our allies  So we warned  way before anybody else we warned about those challenges  BARTIROMO Yes  NUNES You also look at what they have done in giving money out to other countries where they have now own their financial infrastructure and they own their energy structure  And I will just finish on this that the next big challenge here is going to be 5G Our companies here in the United States are so far behind China is giving out free 5G products We are getting lapped by the Chinese over and over and over again And were going to have to take some  were going to have to make some changes if we want to deploy 5G across this country and beat the Chinese  BARTIROMO Congressman youre doing a great job Youre investigating the real important things to the American people and to the national security of America So thank you for that  While you have been doing this your colleagues have been charging the president with collusion with Russia which you had to take slams for because you investigated that it was actually a coup to take down the president  Lets go back to your reporting there and your investigation Where are you on that I know this upcoming week is going to be an important one for General Michael Flynn  What can you tell us  NUNES Well as everyone has been watching the coronavirus our investigation continues  And most critically there is a lot of new information that has come out in terms of things that were redacted or kept classified by someone I dont know who in both the Horowitz report and stuff now that is finally being declassified  And the real question here is is why was this stuff being classified Why were the American people being kept in the dark still being kept in the dark  We finally just got to see the FISA warrant that was used against Carter Page Theres still a lot of black marks OK in that FISA report We need everything declassified so that we can continue this investigation  Why is General Flynn important Because on Friday night thankfully Attorney General Barr has appointed a US attorney out of Missouri to look into what was going on in some of these investigations And now we dont know what was submitted to the court on Friday evening but we believe that its possibly exculpatory evidence that the government had on General Flynn OK  And remember in our report the report which  the House Republican report from 2018 its the gold standard OK of reports If you look at all the other reports whether its the intelligence community assessment whether its the Mueller report whether its the Steele DNC dossier those are all a joke right  And the media has been promoting these  this Russia hoax for so long And the reality you have a  the former head of the DIA who has been strung up here for year after year after year in what was now likely were going to find out he was framed Imagine that being framed by our own government and by political operatives who dont like you  BARTIROMO Yes  NUNES And I think thats what were going to find out  BARTIROMO And we have a timeline here that shows exactly the Michael Flynn situation  Of course he met Donald Trump in August of 2015 They were already looking into Michael Flynn at that time because I guess he wanted an audit of the Department of Defense and of the Pentagon He didnt understand where the money was going  And we see that some of the money was paid out by the Office of Net Assessment Stefan Halper who was an informant was awarded a contract of  several contracts up to 1 million for socalled studies that he was writing But we know that he also was running into Trump campaign people  So theres that  You want to investigate and talk to a certain Russian individual You say this is going to be very important for your investigation Who is that and what do you want to know  NUNES Well what we have  what I have talked about is were looking into what I call the three dossiers OK Were drilling down into those  But because of the new information thats come out from the Horowitz report thats now declassified that we have been talking about for a long time and the FISAs we now are targeting what appear to be three Russian Americans  I think the most important one is somebody that we actually asked to come to our committee named Sergei Millian He is hiding somewhere around the globe We dont know exactly what country hes in But we really would like Sergei to come forward and talk to us because either he was  either he was you know working for Fusion GPS and the Clinton campaign and dirtying up Trump people or its quite possible he may have been framed  We dont know which of those is true but we want to find out And we really need him to  you know he can call my office We will be glad to   if hes afraid to come back to his home country the United States of America  BARTIROMO Yes  NUNES  we can make sure that he can  we can guarantee his safety  But we need to hear from him because he is the source He is Steele and Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS  he is their  he is one of their major sources And guess who did  never interviewed him Maria  BARTIROMO Interesting  NUNES Guess who never interviewed him Robert Muellers team  BARTIROMO Adam Schiff  NUNES Robert Muellers team  BARTIROMO OK  NUNES Even worse  LAUGHTER  NUNES Why would you not  why would you not interview an important person like this  BARTIROMO Unbelievable  Congressman thank you We will be following this story  And we are waiting for accountability and to hear from John Durham hopefully this summer  Congressman Devin Nunes  New York City has been hardhit by the coronavirus We will speak with the mayor  Mayor Bill de Blasio is live next  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BARTIROMO Welcome back  New York City the epicenter of the COVID19 pandemic in the country now as things are slowly beginning to look better there how will the city handle the reopening  Joining me right now is the boss New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio  Mr Mayor its great to have you this morning Thanks very much for being here  I want to ask you that question right here How will a reopening of New York look What industries are poised to open first And when do you see that happening  BILL DE BLASIO D MAYOR OF NEW YORK Thank you Maria  Well first of all Maria you are a proud New Yorker a proud Brooklynite by background You know how tough and resilient this city is  BARTIROMO Yes  DE BLASIO So the first thing I want to say is we will be back we will be strong In fact we will be stronger  And were going to create a city that builds on our previous success and comes back stronger and fairer I believe we can do this And I already see the naysayers out there saying oh New York City is not going to be able to come back  New York City fought back after the fiscal crisis We fought back after 911 We fought back after Hurricane Sandy We will fight back again  What we need to  BARTIROMO So how do you do it  DE BLASIO Yes what we need  theres no question in my mind we must have the support of the federal government to do this because right now to be able to have a strong economy again and really restart we have to be able to provide the basic services that have made this place work police fire sanitation health care education  The things that have made New York City strong and allowed us to get through this crisis are now in the crosshairs because we have lost 74 billion  thats our projection from our budget  74 billion in lost revenue 35 billion in new expenses to pay for the coronavirus and the fight to save lives over 10 billion combined  The federal government must make us whole for us to be able to be in a position to restart If were not whole if New York City is not whole it will drag down the entire region and it will hold up the entire national economic restart  If we are whole  and that could be  BARTIROMO So how much money do you want  DE BLASIO Maria we have to get  BARTIROMO Mr Mayor how much money do you need from the federal government  DE BLASIO All the money thats been lost and will be lost lost revenue  And this is true for New York and cities and states around the country We need 74 billion Thats how much we have lost Thats how much we need to get back  Just like the federal government bailed out the airline industry to the tune of 58 billion bail out the largest city in the country so we can restart and be able to be strong leaders in an economic revitalization in this country  We get that I have no doubt we can move forward  BARTIROMO Let me ask you this  Are you using this crisis to take us into socialism  DE BLASIO Oh Maria  BARTIROMO I just saw you on the press conference and you said this The bigger picture a fair recovery for all confront structural economic and racial inequalities  Are you looking to change things that have nothing to do with the coronavirus and were not impacted by that Mr Mayor  DE BLASIO Maria Im looking to go at the very things that the coronavirus has dredged up  And have we seen it all over the country There are vast health care disparities that have come up that must be addressed for the good of all us of us Its the right thing to do but also to have a strong healthy society  But Maria what Im talking about in the first instance when we talk about just getting on our feet again I think we all can count here If were missing 74 billion  and now we heard today there may be additional state budget cuts looming on top of that that will hit New York City and the whole rest of the state  we wont be able to provide the basic services and have the personnel we need who do that amazing work  Were talking about the heroes the first responders the health care workers the essential workers These are the folks who need to keep their jobs going forward if were going to have a healthy recovery  BARTIROMO Yes Yes Yes  DE BLASIO And if we are missing billions and billions of dollars how on earth are we supposed to do that  BARTIROMO OK  You know what I want to talk more about this People are worried about the air in New York Theyre worried about the hospitals They want to know when they can get back to work  Lets take a short break because I want to take a look at New York even before this You were having issues even before the coronavirus People were leaving Crime is up  Mayor de Blasio is with us live Were looking ahead on Sunday Morning Futures  And we will be right back  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BARTIROMO Welcome back  Im back with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio  Mr Mayor honestly I need an hour with you Theres so many important things to cover in New York  You made a very good case just there You said that the city needs to be made whole  Number one how are the conversations going with President Trump Are you going to get that money  And number two Mr Mayor something that you know I have been railing about about the inmates being let out Now coronavirus is ripping through our prison systems And now youre letting inmates out  The New York Post with a headline Dozens of New York City inmates back in jail after coronavirus relief  Youre letting them out theyre committing crimes and going right back in Even before this between January and March on the heels of your bail reform law car thefts up 65 percent robberies up 24 percent burglaries up 22 percent  We know you have your hands full Mayor What are you going to do about it  DE BLASIO Well I will come to your question about the president in a moment Maria  Real quick there was a bail reform law passed by the state of New York not the city the state of New York There were some things I thought needed to be better In fact a lot of us agreed Governor Cuomo and I and many others agreed there needed to be changes  And the state legislature did make important changes a few weeks ago And I think its going to help us fight crime  But remember the NYPD has done a remarkable job Crime in New York City today the last time it was this low was the 1950s So we have had some challenges the last few months but overall crime continues to go down in New York City NYPD has done an amazing job  In terms of the folks who were in our jail system we let 1400 out who either had very lowlevel offenses or had an immediate health danger because of the coronavirus Theyre being monitored When the jails are able to  and the court system gets backup and running we will bring back anyone who needs to be brought back  Some have done the wrong thing And they will pay the consequences The vast majority havent But it was about protecting lives of correction officers and inmates in a humanitarian crisis  President Trump and I have spoken several times about the stimulus Look I have given President Trump credit when hes helped New York City And sometimes he and his team have done a great job at that  You and I Maria have talked about Peter Navarro and the effort to get us supplies and equipment thats been deeply deeply appreciated And I have thanked the president for that  Where I have been in disagreement with him is hes still not spoken up for the stimulus to help cities and states And he needs to speak up with energy to move the Senate He understands the economy He understands New York City  BARTIROMO Yes  DE BLASIO If we cant pay for basic services we wont have a strong economy  BARTIROMO Yes  DE BLASIO We need to hear the presidents voice Were not hearing it so far  BARTIROMO Mr Mayor I want you to come back to talk about what New York City and New York will look like when we get out of this  I want to know what the subways are going to look like Are they going to be different I want to know in terms of getting back to work  Will you come back soon so we can talk about that because we havent covered it enough  Mr Mayor its great to have you today  Thank you sir "},

VIDEO CLIP  CHARLES PAYNE FOX NEWS ANCHOR President Trump talking about jobs and the economy today as the presidential race moves into high gear He says were seeing a Vshaped recovery  Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden meanwhile also focusing on jobs union jobs in Pennsylvania this hour We are following both  Welcome everyone Im Charles Payne in for Neil Cavuto and this is a special edition of “Your World” And we do have Fox team coverage with David Spunt following the president at the White House Jacqui Heinrich is with the Biden campaign in Harrisburg Pennsylvania  We begin with David  DAVID SPUNT FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Charles good afternoon to you  A big day for President Trump here at the White House Labor Day typically the kickoff to the fall campaign season President Trump holding a news conference on the North Portico behind me And he came out swinging against his opponent former Vice President Joe Biden invoking his name almost two dozen times  But the president began talking about the economy something you know a lot about Charles talked about the unemployment rate down to 84 percent the jobless rate 14 million jobs added in August clearly an improvement from where things were in April in this country the president touting that excess  success  excuse me  Important to note Charles less than two months from the election and more than a month since negotiations began still no deal though on a COVID relief package both sides at a stalemate  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows have gone to the Hill many times to meet with Democratic leadership but with no deal I asked President Trump today why dont you personally Mr President get involved in the negotiations and meet face to face with Democrats  Listen  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP I know my customers Thats what I do I know Pelosi I know Schumer very well They dont want to make a deal because they think its good for politics if they dont make a deal This has nothing to do with anything other than you have to know who youre dealing with  END VIDEO CLIP  SPUNT The president continuing to deny a report from The Atlantic out last week that he referred to American war dead as  quote  losers and  quote  suckers  Listen  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP Who would say a thing like that Only an animal would say a thing like that  Theres nobody that has more respect for not only our military but for people that gave their lives in the military  END VIDEO CLIP  SPUNT And just in from our chief White House correspondent John Roberts Zach Fuentes a former aide to former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly is denying that he is the source of that Atlantic article and did not hear President Trump use those words when talking about the American war dead  Charles  PAYNE David thank you very much  Meanwhile Joe Biden in the battleground state of Pennsylvania where he will be holding a virtual event with the AFLCIO president Richard Trumka just moments from now  Jacqui Heinrich is also in Harrisburg Pennsylvania with more  Jacqui  JACQUI HEINRICH FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Hey there Neil sic  Well Biden announced endorsements from three more unions today collectively representing more than halfamillion union workers Right now hes meeting with the leader of the largest federation of unions Richard Trumka  Labor backing is very important in this election Pennsylvania is home to 700000 union workers And remember President Trump only won this state by less than 1 percent margin in 2016 about 44000 votes  Biden and Trumka released a joint oped today in The Pittsburgh Post Gazette accusing President Trump of diminishing union power and putting Wall Street first writing in part When he isnt calling to boycott Goodyear and its thousands of union workers for petty personal reasons Donald Trump is actively fighting against working people  It also touted Bidens plans to invest in green energy jobs important to spell out amid accusations in the Trump campaign that Bidens energy plan would kill jobs  Biden also took a jab at President Trump while talking to union members who are veterans bringing up reports that President Trump allegedly disparaged American service members calling the nations war dead allegedly losers and suckers  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  JOE BIDEN DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE You were in Afghanistan as well as Iraq correct  UNIDENTIFIED MALE Yes I went to Iraq and Afghanistan  BIDEN How long were you in Afghanistan You were in Afghanistan  UNIDENTIFIED MALE For a whole year 365 days Iraq also  BIDEN Did you think most of those guys and women are suckers  LAUGHTER  UNIDENTIFIED MALE No  END VIDEO CLIP  HEINRICH There is a small group of Biden supporters here also a small group of Trump supporters both these groups trying to get a glance at the former vice president  Charles  PAYNE Jacqui thank you very much  So are jobs becoming the defining issue of this presidential race on this Labor Day President Trump says we are seeing a super V recovery while the Biden camp claims its more like a K shape where the middleclass and workingclass Americans they say theyre still not benefiting  So which is it  Joining me now Republican strategist Lauren Claffey along with Democratic strategist Robert Patillo and The New York Posts Kelly Jane Torrance  Kelly Jane let me start with you  Listen I look at the data every single day I cut through it I carve it up I look at all aspects of it And most of it is  has been a super V from manufacturing to homebuilding to households  So the chart looks like a super V These charts do  KELLY JANE TORRANCE NEW YORK POST Yes Charles its really interesting to see  Now between February and April 22 million jobs were lost in America Thats unprecedented This is  we havent seen this since the Great Recession Now we have only gotten just about half of them back but still 11 million jobs since April returned  That is quite something And again were seeing a lot of gains made by lots of various people I mean before the pandemic AfricanAmericans Hispanics women were seeing record low unemployment numbers  Now of course its back up Wed like to get it back to where it was Its going to take some work  But I do think that President Trump has a great record on jobs until the pandemic Much of that wasnt his fault of course  PAYNE Right  TORRANCE In New York City as you know restaurants cant even have indoor dining And thats not a President Trump decision And thats killing thousands of jobs here in New York  So I think that the recovery we have seen has been amazing and its  hopefully it will continue to stay that way  PAYNE And if we get back to February then were talking 152 million jobs  Robert that was an alltime high Those unemployment levels were at all time lows And we have come back I think certainly more than the economists a lot of the experts thought we could You could argue that maybe its starting to stall though  ROBERT PATILLO DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST Well I think this idea of a super V which is a nonsense term that has just been made up we have to look at whats going on in reality for the American people  Were looking at 190000 people who have died of this virus and no clear federal administrative plan to deal with it Were dealing with a housing crisis which is going to hit us where we have an eviction crisis and both a foreclosure crisis ahead of us  We have the issues of the stimulus program which turned into a billion dollar slush fund for Kanye West and other multimilliondollar companies The American people only got 1200 checks of several months ago  So what we really need is a focusing not on Wall Street but on Main Street on those real life Americans who need this  who need the economic stimulus and need the ability to recover from this economy  And right now it seems to be the only thing this administration is worried about stock prices among the Fortune 500 companies  PAYNE Yes  Lauren one thing I will tell you anyone who doesnt think the stock market influences the overall economy is nuts You dont want this market at an alltime low That triggered the recession this year It triggered the Great Recession the Great Depression Every major downturn that caused misery with the poorest Americans began with the stock market crash  So no one should be rooting for that And some of the things Robert said was true although Im not sure its the White Houses fault President Trump just found money in FEMA 45 states are going to be able to extend unemployment there  He just had a moratorium on evictions until the end of the year I mean Id say pox on both houses when it comes to Congress getting their act together But there is a super V when you look at a lot of the data  It doesnt mean we dont have a long way to go either  Laura Laura  LAUREN CLAFFEY REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST Yes I think what Robert said is partially true in that  oh can you hear me  PAYNE Yes  CLAFFEY Im sorry Charles  I think that what he said is partially true in that youre right the stock market does affect every bit of the economy and we need it to do well and I think its a leading factor on how we are recovering as a country  But electorally and when were talking about the election what really matters is how do people feel that they are being affected by this economy by the pandemic What certainty do they have in their bank accounts that they can plan for the future that they feel good about this  So until Americans on the ground level really feel the momentum that were seeing in this recovery with the pandemic I dont know that it matters as much for President Trump that this will be a good election issue until he can really make the case to everyday Americans that theyre going to be OK in a couple months  PAYNE OK financially OK with respect to the COVID  Because Kelly Jane you brought up the main point I think is that a lot of this stuff is out of the White Houses hands If youre in a state or a city that wont allow inroom dining then youre going to have to fire a lot of people  If youre the only one in your state or only one in your city who can go to the hair salon and get a blowout youre going to fire a lot of people I mean so the fact of the matter is I get the touchyfeely part of politics and I think its despicable to make people feel like theyre doing worse than theyre actually doing  I get thats part of it Kelly Jane but theres also  where people must know that help has been on the way although they do need more  TORRANCE Yes Charles its really quite something isnt it  I wonder When I hear Bill de Blasio mayor of New York say that hes not sure were going to have indoor dining until a vaccine in the spring I wonder why he wants to destroy businesses  And a lot of people think that New York for example Governor Cuomo and Bill de Blasio are hoping for a bailout from the federal government and if not now then maybe after November depending on if theres a changed administration  PAYNE Right Right  TORRANCE So again all of the shutdowns were local basically  I mean the federal government really only advised a short shutdown Its   they have obviously been extended and to some degree unnecessarily  I mean theres  the virus is all but gone from New York I mean theres still cases  CROSSTALK  PAYNE Robert  let me get  let me bring Robert in for a final last word  Robert when Obama and Trump took over bluecollar wages were going up 495 percent year over They were going up pretty good 378 percent year over year When they left it was only up 23 percent There was a drop of 61 percent  How does Vice President Biden argue that he would be the best president for bluecollar workers when their wages collapsed under the eight years that President Obama and he held office  PATILLO Well because what you have to look at is the fact that when youre building back better you have a sustainable economy  The  we have green energy jobs which are growing faster than fossil fuel jobs We have the ability to work up actual trade deals with other nations which bring manufacturing back to this country  President Trumps economic  economy was built off of tax cuts and deficits We have done nothing to close those gaps We have done nothing to bring down the national debt  What President Biden will do is make sure we have a sustainable economy thats not built on a razors edge which only benefits the 1 percent and actually peoples takehome pay will be affected by it  So I think thats what Joe Biden will do differently than whats being done by the current administration  PAYNE All right Well its a mad dash to the finish line  Thank you all very much  Meanwhile the battle for the Badger State is also in play both campaigns closing in on Wisconsin today but can Trump and Pence close the gap thats there right now  Former Republican Governor Scott Walker is next  COMMERCIAL BREAK  PAYNE Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris both campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin today  Mike Pence delivering remarks on the economy at Dairyland Power in La Crosse while Kamala Harris is meeting with union members in Milwaukee  Thats where you will find our very own Peter Doocy  Peter  PETER DOOCY FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Charles good afternoon  Kamala Harris has been bouncing around Milwaukee Shes about to meet with black business owners for a socially distanced roundtable But the first thing she did when she touched down at Milwaukee Mitchell International earlier today was meet with the family of Jacob Blake  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  KAMALA HARRIS DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE Really wonderful I mean theyre an incredible family and what they have endured and they just do it with such dignity and grace  And theyre carrying the weight of a lot of voices on their shoulders  END VIDEO CLIP  DOOCY Well Wisconsin voters are also hearing a different message about Kenosha from Vice President Mike Pence who is also campaigning in the state today and trying to highlight the steps he and President Trump took to try and stop the destructive riots that followed the Jacob Blake shooting  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE President Trump took action just a few days ago  We sent 200 federal law enforcement officers into Kenosha Working with the National Guard and local law enforcement we quelled the violence Under this president I promise you we will have law and order in every city in this country for every American of every race and creed and color  APPLAUSE  PENCE So help us God  END VIDEO CLIP  DOOCY Pence is in the air on his way back to Washington DC  Kamala Harris is still here in Milwaukee They campaigned on opposite sides of the state today in this Kamala Harris first inperson day of campaigning out on the trail in a swing state since being added to the ticket almost one month ago  Charles  PAYNE All right Peter thank you very much  Joe Biden well hes counting on union support in the upcoming election But if President Trump garners the same support that he got in 2016 from labor unions this goaround many think it could be enough to win a state like Wisconsin  Lets ask former Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker  Governor Walker thanks for joining us  FORMER WISCONSIN GOV SCOTT WALKER Hey Charles Happy Labor Day to you  PAYNE Yes you too sir  Last time around President Trump  Hillary Clinton won more union support but her margin of 8 percent far below Obamas 18 percent And since then we have seen sort of even a more magnetic pull for President Trump among grassroots union workers  WALKER Well this president not only can relate to the forgotten men and women many of whom are everyday hardworking people many of whom are in labor unions and as well as nonunion workers but this guys delivered  When you look before the pandemic we had the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years the lowest ever recorded obviously for AfricanAmerican Hispanic American AsianAmerican people disabilities and veterans  I think people have seen just in the report that came out last week nearly 14 million new jobs Unemployment that the Fed said wasnt going to go below 9 percent by the end of the year is now 84 percent  I think the workers out there understand that Donald Trump is the guy who got them back to work in the past and is going to get them back to work again right now  PAYNE Now we know there are a lot of industries that are shut down Again were millions of jobs away from where we were in February  But a point I was trying to bring up last segment is bluecollar wages last month were up 495 percent I mean thats just  thats well above inflation And if you are fortunate enough to have a job that continues a trend thats been going on for several years now where bluecollar wages have gone up faster than inflation and faster than anyone elses  Thats been unique in our country for well over a decade Is this something that you would like to hear the president speak of more particularly in a swing state like Wisconsin  WALKER Absolutely  Manufacturing and agriculture  agricultural jobs  excuse me  are big time here in the state of Wisconsin We along with Indiana are the two largest manufacturing states as a percentage of our overall employment as a state  And we have got the wide range from very small to big businesses involved in manufacturing And when we saw the numbers the last few years remember Barack Obama when Joe Biden was the vice president was talking about how these jobs werent going to come back that you would need to have the magic wand  Well we have seen those jobs come back since Donald Trump and Mike Pence have been in office Were going to see them come back again And youre right Wages are going up People can see it with their own eyes  The other thing to remember Kamala Harris is one of the cosponsors of the socalled Green New Deal which is not green not new and certainly not a good deal out there  Were looking at manufacturing and agricultural jobs would be devastated by that radical plan that Bernie Sanders and others are pushing and that Joe Bidens kind of given a wink to  I think part of the reason why theyre in Pennsylvania is  and not just here in Wisconsin but Biden is in Pennsylvania today  is  PAYNE Right  WALKER  he first said he was against fracking Now hes for it Those are the kinds of jobs in Pennsylvania and Michigan or Ohio and Wisconsin that will really matter on Election Day  PAYNE Right  WALKER Theres no doubt hes been doing a lot of cleanup on that or at least attempting to  We got less than a minute to go When it does come from these clean energy jobs or these  these nonfossil fuel jobs I dont see a lot of Republican pushback And I question how these jobs are tabulated  I know under the prior administration if you drove a bus that was run on natural gas it was considered a clean energy job right  LAUGHTER  PAYNE So I mean its  I dont think theres going to enough socalled organic green energy jobs for us to get rid of fracking and to be aggressively antifossil fuel in this country and by the way remain a top economic country in the world  WALKER Right  Men and women in organized labor overwhelmingly get it Its why last year people forget the AFLCIO sent a letter out raising real concerns about the socalled Green New Deal They want to work They understand Donald Trumps got them back to work before Hes going to do it again  And we see the numbers wages up jobs up  PAYNE All right  WALKER Were only seeing more of that We dont want to go down the path of Biden and Harris  PAYNE Governor thank you very much Always appreciate it  WALKER Good to be with Charles  PAYNE All right folks New York now seeing more violent protests in Rochester and now demonstrators are coming from Alaska  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE We have arrested people who provided addresses from Alaska and Massachusetts and other parts of the country  END VIDEO CLIP  COMMERCIAL BREAK  PAYNE Youre looking live at New York City And it looks like a lot of young adults are leaving the big cities and moving back home with mom and dad but why Well we have got the answers  Were back in just 60 seconds  COMMERCIAL BREAK  PAYNE Protests across the country growing violent over the weekend  Fox News correspondent Mike Tobin has the latest  Mike  MIKE TOBIN FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Well hey there Charles  Protesters continue to clash with police as the protests in Portland Oregon have crossed the 100day mark Thats what they did on Saturday night Most dramatic scene coming out of Portland is when one of the protesters was set on fire by an errant firebomb thrown by one of his fellow protesters  But Molotov cocktails appeared around 900 pm Saturday night and that is when law enforcement declared a riot One officer was injured when he was hit by a firework 59 people were arrested Two of them had knives  Both police and protesters were injured in Rochester New York The demonstrations there were triggered when a man died in police custody Cops had put a hood over the head of Daniel Prude to stop him from spitting up police officers and he died  As the protests in New York rage for fifth night President Trump blames Democratic leaders for being too easy on the violent demonstrators  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP They stand there they throw things at the people that are supposed to be protecting something and nothing happens They throw rocks They throw cans of soup They throw lots of hard objects And rarely does anything happen  END VIDEO CLIP  TOBIN And the Kentucky Derby ran over the weekend with no crowds in the stands but crowds outside demonstrating  They are outraged over the death of Breonna Taylor who was shot and killed when police served a noknock warrant on her apartment The antipolice demonstrators were met by propolice progun demonstrators in Louisville   Charles back to you  PAYNE Thank you very much  Meanwhile Rochester officials blaming outside agitators for escalating the protests  So what does law enforcement need to do to stop this  Former NYPD Detective and CEO of Brosnan Risk Consultants Pat Brosnan joins me now  Pat it seems invariably like these city mayors and police chiefs are trying to walk a very  a very tight rope here if you will They dont want to upset the protesters per se They dont want to accept any responsibility And it all seems to be blame the White House in many cases for cities that already were in a lot of trouble and obviously now in more trouble  PAT BROSNAN FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE Just throwing gas on the flames Charles  The reality is that Portland Oregon  its interesting how movies are timeless Thats become the Twilight Zone And then you have the Three Stooges masquerading as leadership  You have Governor Kate Brown OK Its mostly peaceful protests You have Mayor Ted  criminals kicked him out of his own house by the way  Wheeler And then you have DA Mike lets cut them loose Schmidt  Theyre all seriously delusional and titanically unaware of the effects Charles of desecration of the police and destruction of the rule of law  What youre seeing is how it becomes exponential how once you give them an inch they take a yard A yard becomes a mile And were seeing it night after night after night It is astonishing  PAYNE What worries me is a city for  like Rochester for instance I ran the numbers Their murder rate is 180 percent above the US rapes 56 percent above robbery 191 percent above and assaults are 85 percent above  Again this is a US  American city that was already in a lot of trouble a lot of turmoil And so I know that theyre in a delicate position But if they take this opportunity only to blame the federal government only to blame President Trump Im worried that these kind of numbers could actually get worse  BROSNAN One thousand percent We have seen it in New York I mean take New York for example  I have written up as the seven deadly sins by the titanically unaware de Blasio The reality is six of them begin with D so its easy to remember You got the defunding You got the dismantling of the anticrime units You got disinterested prosecutors We dont want to press charges  You have got desecration of the police You have destruction of the rule of law Theyre all Ds And what comes out of it Charles and what youre seeing manifested in the numbers in Portland and Rochester is the birth of the empowered criminal the criminal who doesnt worry who can strut with a gun in his waistband with impunity  That is a bad set of  thats a very very serious denigration of the rule of law and a bad set of circumstances And were seeing it in all the major cities  PAYNE Right  Pat what do we do on the other side of this conversation with respect to police I have seen enough videos now to wonder particularly when it comes to apprehension and either the holding of someone whos being apprehended or trying to handcuff these people whoever these suspects are is  can there should there be some sort of better type of training  And of course in Rochester you have what the  where Mr Prude had something put over his head to stop him from spitting and the official birth  the official death certificate says he died from complications from asphyxia  On that end of the spectrum what should be done  BROSNAN Well I agree Charles theres always room for more progressive training more advanced training deescalation training in different formats absolutely  My position is that sworn police officers can never be overtrained Theres no such thing as overtraining Continuous progressive training is absolutely consistent with an evolving set of facts in the field  But it comes with a little bit more than that There has to be support There has to be support from politicians has to be support from their leadership They have to support the officers the men and women Otherwise the debasement the desecration the defilement the diminishment of the officers and what theyre sworn to do protect and serve will exacerbate as sure as the sun sets in the West  PAYNE Yes I agree with you Im not sure why there cant be a greater role for greater social justice racial justice in this country better law enforcement training  And all of it points to a better society And to see police officers thrown under the bus time after time by these large city elected officials has been heartbreaking All of it been really troubling obviously  Thank you very much Appreciate your calm and very straightforward comments on there a lot for us to think about  BROSNAN My pleasure Thank you  CROSSTALK  PAYNE Meanwhile folks the jobless rate I dont know if you have seen this coming down big time Now its single digits  So the question is do we really need trillions in more stimulus We have got the Labor Day debate you dont want to miss Its coming right up  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP They dont want to make a deal because they know thats good for the economy And if they make a deal thats good for the economy and therefore its good for me for the election in November  November 3  And therefore theyre not going to make a deal  END VIDEO CLIP  PAYNE All right I guess we will just put President Trump down as a maybe on Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer when it comes to making a COVID deal  But putting the politics aside there are still calls for more stimulus even with the unemployment rate falling to single digits So the question is do we really need it now  Heather Zumarraga says that yes its time to stop and make it happen but Gary Kaltbaum thinks one more round of stimulus  actually hes for it He thinks it could do the trick  So let me start with you Gary because I was a little surprised to hear that you thought maybe there would be  that we do more money pumped into the system  GARY KALTBAUM FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR Well full disclosure Im one of the biggest deficit hawks out there  But I just believe theres moments in time where government has to do their thing and I still think the war goes on And there are 75plusmillion people still on employee from January Over the holiday weekend airline 60 percent below last year which directly affects so many other industries restaurants still way down under capacity  I just think we need more of a bridge going forward especially into the holiday season I meet with a lot of these families that are in the services industries and theyre up at 300 in the morning not knowing how theyre going to pay bills going forward  I just think this is a necessity  PAYNE Heather you think thats enough enough is enough  HEATHER ZUMARRAGA FINANCIAL ANALYST Well I think parts of it can be extended  I mean you if you look at the economic data coming out yes there are still many millions of Americans relying on the unemployment benefits that are provided by the states  But we are getting jobs back Were going back to normal in terms of reopening the economy The August jobs report was great Consumer spending is up despite losing a supplemental bonus of 600 per week So the data  and this is according to JP Morgan Chase They showed credit card spending was up even after people  the supplemental bonus unemployment were off  So the data is showing that were doing OK at this point in time Republicans have proposed about 1 trillion You go with that plan instead of the 3 trillion plan proposed by Democrats And the reason I say that is because the data is showing things are getting better Its not based on feelings or emotions Its based on the facts  PAYNE Gary one thing though is that these numbers are slowing right Theyre beginning to slow just a little bit  And you look at the initial jobless claims pandemic unemployment insurance theres a lot of nuances to this data that to me suggests this has been a powerful bridge to get us this far I think everyone would agree we have came  we have come a lot further than the experts said we would back in March and April  But I tend to lean with you on this Gary I dont think that theres enough oomph in the system And I dont think people will be confident to keep spending if they dont think theres at least one more round coming  KALTBAUM Agreed  And I dont think somethings up  something that has not been said enough what a magnificent job they did government  believe it or not Im saying this  with the first round to be able to get it done so quickly and so huge  PAYNE Yes  KALTBAUM There was a few things here and there but they got it done It just needs more time  And Im dealing with real world here Charles I deal with a lot of these families the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Florida You should hear some of these stories Again I have to repeat Imagine having to be up at night wondering how youre going to put food on the table the next day because youre out your job because youre in the service industry whether it be the hotels or airlines  They did such a good job first goround Just continue with a little bit longer It does not have to be 3 trillion Doesnt have to be 2 trillion but another  another big one I hate saying it but I just think it is a necessity and will do a hell of lot of good if you move forward  ZUMARRAGA And Charles if I may Im not saying that  PAYNE Yes Yes We will have a conversation like this in six years and Ill bring this up  Go ahead Heather  LAUGHTER  ZUMARRAGA Im not saying that Paycheck Protection Program didnt work and didnt save tens of millions of jobs  I think even the most fiscal conservatives in Congress agree that that needed to happen the 22 trillion But at what point in time at some point in time are debt and deficits  a new report today showing that we will have the highest debt since World War II as a country  So it exceeds the size of our economy and you know that future generations will have to pay for that Yes we want to get people back to work A vaccine will help and reopening the economy will help as well  But we want  we also want to make sure that were not racking up unnecessary spending And thats what the Republicans want to be careful of Even Larry Kudlow said hes supportive but he wants to make sure its not a multitrilliondollar deal  PAYNE Yes  Well its also an election year  Gary you have got 60 seconds left 30 seconds left But I think thats complicating issues as well Its the ultimate game of chicken But to your point its Americans who are suffering  KALTBAUM Absolutely This is real world These are families  This is emotions This is psychology This is getting a bridge to the next point And once we get past this and get some sort of vaccine and get passed this nonsense we can all celebrate that government actually did something that really worked and worked well  And then we will worry about it down the road By the way debt and deficits that horse left the barn 10 years so  PAYNE Yes  KALTBAUM Twenty years ago Hows that  LAUGHTER  PAYNE Yes Yes  ZUMARRAGA It doesnt mean you keep going and you keep printing  PAYNE Yes No we crossed the Rubicon when it came to that a long time ago  CROSSTALK  PAYNE All right thank you both two of my favorites Heather Gary see you soon  Hey the bigger the gatherings this weekend the higher the surge this fall What health officials are saying right now  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  BIDEN I want full transparency on a vaccine  One of the problems is the way hes playing with politics is hes said so many things that arent true Im worried if we do have a really good vaccine people are going to be reluctant to take it And so hes undermining public confidence  TRUMP Contrary to all of the lies the vaccine  they will politicize They will say anything  And its so dangerous for our country what they say But the vaccine will be very safe and very effective And it will be delivered very soon  END VIDEO CLIP  PAYNE Putting politics aside if we do get a vaccine before Election Day how safe will it be  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicines Dr Anita Gupta joins me now  Dr Gupta I want to alert the audience that the major players in this race for a vaccine have all put out a press release vowing that they would hold  adhere to high scientific ethics and standards when it comes to this vaccine and the manufacturing of it  So Pfizer Johnson  Johnson Sanofi and Moderna all trying to let the public know hey when we get to the finish line we will we will get there right way  DR ANITA GUPTA JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE Right  And look  and just to step back I mean this is a high science process Distributing developing a COVID19 vaccine or any vaccine is always high science And its one of the most challenging public health initiatives ever attempted  And so we have to keep that in mind This is not a political process It is a public health process and it is one at a global level So we have to get to 300 million Americans and we have to get around the world And we may have to do that multiple times  So it is a long arduous process that requires not only the US Food and Drug Administration but global regulators from around the world  PAYNE Right  GUPTA So it is a massive massive process  PAYNE So then how concerned are you  I was really surprised when I heard vice presidential candidate  nominee Kamala Harris suggest that she would not take a vaccine There are enough people out there who arent going to take it anyway Many people dont want to be the first to take it if they eventually do take it  I mean its got its own issues to begin with But certainly how concerned are you about the politicization that this is even being brought up in politics when its a medical issue  GUPTA Look we have to go back to the data There is due process when we look at any drug product or vaccine How safe is it How effective is it  And as a scientist and as a physician I will look at the data I want to look at the evidence and make sure that it is effective And I think thats what we have to look at and leave it to the scientists to let them do their work  Were looking at the process very transparently right now And I know thats sometimes difficult to see But ultimately the companies that are working on it  PAYNE Right  GUPTA  theyre doing what they need to do  And its never too early to begin action when were dealing with a massive global pandemic  PAYNE Absolutely  Well I want to switch gears a little bit  Labor Day gatherings raising some concerns about a potential rise in cases as we head into the fall Will the holiday and a lot of these big gatherings mean more COVID19 hot spots in the weeks to come  GUPTA Certainly there is certain concern about this And we have heard all the precautions  Prevention is utmost concern here And certainly there is a period that we have to wait and see a twoweek period here that we will have to wait and see what happened from this weekend But theres certain concern amongst experts including myself of what will happen There is certainly a need for social distancing That has to continue wearing masks and certainly the handwashing  And we should not compromise that whether theres a holiday or not  PAYNE All right  GUPTA  and continue to remain safe and follow all the precautions put forward by all the experts and our communities  PAYNE It does seem intriguing though because we have seen large gatherings  I looked at Sturgis for instance I know a lot of folks are watching that And while there have been some cases its not coming near the hype or the fear factor Is there something going on where  thats mitigating the spread of these  of the coronavirus out of these big events where there is no social distancing per se  Whats happening there  GUPTA Well look I think individuals are tired Theres definitely an exhaustion factor  And individuals want to be outside  PAYNE Yes  GUPTA They want to break free from that  But we have to remember there are still individuals that are seriously ill theyre hospitalized And there is a major global pandemic  PAYNE Sure  GUPTA And in order to bend that we will have to continue to follow all precautions  PAYNE Dr Gupta thank you very much We always appreciate it  Well no more emptynesters  why young adults are shacking up with mom and dad at the greatest clip since the Great Depression  COMMERCIAL BREAK  PAYNE Well home sweet home is getting a bit more crowded  New analysis from Pew Research showing the majority of young adults are currently living with their parents the first time we have seen that since the Great Depression the economic downturn from COVID19 a big reason  And that has Fox News contributor Kat Timpf worried  Kat I mean whats  its an emergency People are going back home What could be wrong with that  KATHERINE TIMPF FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Right  Well unfortunately whats wrong with that is that no matter how much you might try to think that this is just a pause in time stay at home while this pandemic gets figured out time doesnt pause right  If you have to move home because you lose your job or because things are tough because of the pandemic for you you dont really get that time back to do something else We may be seeing a lot of people from this generation who are behind not just in terms of career but also so in sort of life skills growing up independence right  You live on your own you have that first time you have to deal with that difficult neighbor or that first time you have to deal with that jerk of a landlord or the first time you wake up to a mouse scurrying next to your face That last one might have been just me  LAUGHTER  TIMPF But independence is so important And its unfortunately one of those things that you have to learn by doing And thats the only way you can learn it  PAYNE So youre concerned about some sort of rearrested development  In other words time moves on but when we go home we actually move backwards  TIMPF Yes I dont know if its necessarily moving backwards but rather just taking a lot longer to grow up because you can try to make the best of it  And I know that a lot of people might not have a choice And this was of course something that was  has been increasing since the 60s before the pandemic more and more young people living home with mom and dad  But now because of the pandemic a lot of younger people who are just sort of starting out their career they have been hit the hardest by this And its going to make it really hard for them to learn the kind of skills that you cant learn without doing right  I remember finding a cockroach in my apartment called my daddy What do you want me to do Its a good point Its my problem I got to deal with it You really have no choice but to deal with your own problems when youre on your own  And sometimes theres things that come up that you didnt even know would be something you would have to deal with because you dont think about it when youre living with mom and dad And youre not going to get that chance until you are out on your own  So this is really really sad to see a generation sort of continually getting clobbered by this  PAYNE All right well Kat I  youre always our voice of wisdom when it comes to these kind of things  LAUGHTER  PAYNE But Im not sure theres any way around it right now right I mean this the predicament that were in  TIMPF Yes its really tough  I dont know Parents maybe flood your kids rooms with cockroaches and then dont answer their calls  LAUGHTER  TIMPF Dont do that Dont do that Dont do that  PAYNE Or just sit around in a robe and wait for them to come home late one night with her date  TIMPF Yes  PAYNE All right Kat that will do it I always appreciate it  LAUGHTER  PAYNE Hey folks remember the market is back in action tomorrow and so am I 200 pm Eastern time on the Fox Business Network  Remember we were under a lot of pressure Its going to be a big day Its still a big day here  The Five starts right now  END "},

the numbers are such that it’s not necessarily going to overwhelm “One of the main issues with this pandemic is people are going to get infected its a respiratory disease it’s just the way it happens it spreads but we want that spread to happen slower so that the system doesnt get overwhelmed the medical system” he continued “We worked very hard in Florida” DeSantis went on to say that Florida now has more availability of beds because there has been a lot of “diligence”  “The hospitals are working hard Weve done executive orders to do that Weve prepared for this surge and we want to make sure that the beds are available for the Floridians who need it” he said “On the Zaandam those folks will get into a hospital in South Florida as soon as this agreement is reached It is the humanitarian

contrary to just everything else were trying to do for public health not only in Florida but throughout the country right now” He added “Obviously as governor I have an interest in getting Floridians back to Florida safely I also have an interest in making sure that if a Floridian has been exposed to this virus that they’re not in a position to expose others”  He said the plan to get the passengers off the ships will “be done carefully”  “At the end of the day these cruise ships are problems when you talk about a respiratory contagious virus” he said “I know that they stopped sailing You still have some of the ones that had taken off in March and thats just the situation we find ourselves in” In Florida more than 8010 COVID19 cases have been reported with 128 deaths

wear face masks thats new today or other facial coverings when traveling outside the home And its all comes as the president utilizes the Defense Production Act to ban certain exports of critical medical supplies He did this because 3M  they were selling masks made  Americanmade masks N95 masks to other countries Hello  And by the way the company CEO said stopping international shipments would have significant humanitarian implications That  we didnt elect you for that Americans need the masks Who are you to decide that  Well now they have no choice rightfully so  And US company should not have been giving those masks abroad when this country so desperately needs them here The president was right to take action Now the US is even allowing imports of what are called KN95 masks the Chinese alternative to the critical N95 masks and we do know the production GM Ford and others they are beginning to crank them out as well  The president also announcing that the federal government will cover hospital costs for uninsured COVID19 patients Everybody will be covered  As we speak hydroxychloroquine is frequently used now nationwide by hospitals to treat the disease With positive preliminary results and by the way of 6000 doctors surveyed they agreed the one thing they agreed on this is the one thing they are saying that they would use to treat people that have it Well get

worst in others  Soon we will this is the United States we will be on the road to recovery Well beat the disease and as I have said many times this too shall pass  All right Joining us now with more facts without fear the US surgeon general Dr Jerome Adams  OK Why have we had such   CROSSTALK  DR JEROME ADAMS US SURGEON GENERAL Good evening Sean  HANNITY Thank you sir for  I know youre working day and night I know nobody is sleeping  Why has there been so much confusion on the issue of surgical masks  ADAMS Well thats a great question and its important for the American people to know that the task force always makes recommendations based on the science  And the science originally told us that people who wear masks are not protecting themselves from the virus We actually recommend that people who have symptoms or people who think they may have the disease to wear a mask so they dont spread it to others And the WHO the CDC and my office all initially stated that  Whats changed Well what changed is we found that there are significant number of people who have asymptomatic spread of the virus and so the CDC changed its recommendations today and they now suggest that the general public consider wearing masks when theyre going out in public so as not to spread disease to other people particularly in situations where they may be closer than six feet from each other  A couple of really important points that I want you to know Number one this does not replace social distancing The most important thing to do is to still stay home  If youre going to wear facial covering please make sure you dont touch your face and that you wash your hands so you werent contaminating yourself And leave the N95 in the surgical masks to the health care professionals because they need them to take care of high risk patients A cloth facial covering is what the CDC recommends that works just fine to protect other people from you because were all in this together You wear a mask to protect me and I wear it to protect you Sean  HANNITY Can you tell Americans tonight that we have enough masks that well have enough ventilators Do  I mean these are important questions And I know weve been getting the daily briefings We know what GM is doing we know that the Defense Act was utilized by the president for ventilators and now today as it relates to 3M  But I think what everybody wants to know like New York 3000 cases where I live tonight new cases today And Americans just want to know that the equipment is going to be there for front line workers those that put themselves on the line and people want to know that those that get really sick will have the ventilators if they need them  And how important would it be to get enough hydroxychloroquine to New York so that Andrew Cuomos executive order forcing people into hospitals when people in consultation with their doctors want to take it wont have to go to a hospital which is not necessarily the best place to be  ADAMS Well you ask a great question about supplies and we are working number one with the stockpile to make sure places like New York City are getting what they need when they need it And thats not to say that youre going to get 30000 ventilators Thats going to say  thats to say if you need 200 ventilators tomorrow were going to make sure you get 200 ventilators tomorrow so everyone has a ventilator  Well the president is also working on the supply chain and using the Defense Production Act to create new supplies were working on reallocating supplies locally  But the most important thing for people to know is the way did not run out of ventilators is to make sure so many people dont need ventilators and thats why we extended the guidelines for another 30 days We need to drive down demand  HANNITY All right  ADAMS We need not so many people out there spreading the disease to each other so we dont run out of supplies  HANNITY Question  I have Dr Oz on my radio and TV show Weve talked a lot about hydroxychloroquine  Youve been reading about it  ADAMS Yes  HANNITY What are your thoughts  ADAMS Well I think theres promising data out there and Dr Oz and I talked Dr Torres Dr Gupta we talk all the time along with other people on the task force and there is some promising data out there We also want to collect data to make sure   CROSSTALK  HANNITY Would you take  Mr Surgeon General if you have  if you contracted this would you take it  ADAMS Well if I contracted it I wouldnt necessarily take it right away I would talk to my doctor I have risk factors and many people know that Ive talked about the fact that Im prediabetic and I have a lung disease  I would talk to my doctor and determine whether or not we felt my course was such that I was someone who should take that But I think every patient should have the opportunity to talk to their doctor about this and make a decision thats right for them since its still in experimental drug at this point at least for this   CROSSTALK  HANNITY All right Thats a good point Everyone has their own underlying issues and consulting your doctor is key on that  All right thank you We hope we can get the equipment that we need at the time we need it Thank you sir for all youre doing  Now each night were going to update you with the latest facts without fear including information your not going to get from the biased mob in the media And their sick their ugly twisted world this pandemic  theyre using it as another opportunity to do what they do every day and thats bash President Trump How many times have I said it If he cured cancer theyd criticized him for that I think Ive proven correct unfortunately  Now misery seems to love company Joyless Behar trying to get California Governor Gavin Newsom to say bad things about the president Unfortunately for Joyless it did not go as planned Take a look  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  JOY BEHAR THE VIEW HOST Do you feel like you have to feed this guys ego to get the respirators and to get PPEs Is that whats going on  GOV GAVIN NEWSOM DCA All I can say is from my perspective the relationship has been strong and Im not doing it to kiss the ring and Im not doing it in a way you know that  I am just being forthright with the president  He returns calls he reaches out hes been proactive Weve got that Mercy ship down here in Los Angeles that was directly because he sent it down here  END VIDEO CLIP  HANNITY Every  by the way if theres a lesson there for Andrew Cuomo you know what Andrew the president is giving you those hospitals you take photoops in front of Yes hes been building all the things that well you didnt do yourself  Governor Newsom by the way is a far left Democrat He has about well 68 lawsuits I think he said pending against the Trump administration Not really a fan of Donald Trump but hes working together and hes leading his state and making it more safe and secure done a much better job than theyve done in New York Ill tell you that  And hes telling the truth putting partisan politics aside He should be commended tonight  Cuomo on the other hand he has been complaining each and every day And sure hes going to show up for a photo outfit lets see the Javits Center hospital that Donald Trump and the federal government constructed the Army Corps of Engineers hes accepting thousands of ventilators and he threw in a warehouse millions of masks and gowns and going around on TV and take a photoup in front of the ship the Comfort that by the way only had 20 people today Im not sure why and bash the administration and demanding they do their job yesterday tweeting We do not have enough ventilators period  So how many ventilators is Cuomo short He does realize they were 50 other states that are dealing with the virus  Now today during his daily briefing the president addressed this very issue Lets take a look  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES They should have had more ventilators They were totally underserviced We are trying to do  were doing our best in New York You know we have  we have states we have a lot of states we have territories too but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of some much more so than others We work very well with the governor we happen to think that he is wellserved with ventilators Were going to find out but we have other states to take care of  END VIDEO CLIP  HANNITY Every New Yorker needs to know what an epic fail  Governor Cuomo has failed the state of New York on a terrible level After all November 2015 he was given  will show you the report an important report from New York states health department department of help  Let me read from page 30 It says quote During a severe influenza pandemic there is likely to be a projected shortfall of ventilators 15783 during peak week demand  After reading this report Cuomo he purchased zero ventilators for New York By the way smallest geographical location with 11 million people New York City Instead he instructed the commission to figure out ways to ration the existing 2000 ventilators  The number one target of terrorism the number one at risk place in the country for disease the most dense population has a shortage of ventilators He wouldnt buy them but he wasted 750 million on a solar project another 600 million on another idiotic project 90 million on the light bulb project and he wouldnt buy the ventilators  Now because of an executive order also in New York any prescription of the potentially lifesaving treatment hydroxychloroquine if you want it youve got to go to the hospital system which is already overrun So in other words you cant have your doctor call into your pharmacy in consultation with your doctor he wont let that happen  And Cuomo why I thought you were prochoice Governor Let America  let New Yorkers in consultation with their doctors decide The president when you ask him like every other time hes building you hospitals all over the place sending you thousands of ventilators bailing you out Im sure he will send you the hydroxychloroquine just ask  Instead he goes out on TV pounds his chest all talk no action blames the president and his own health department told him to buy them He refused He wasted hundreds and hundreds and even billions of dollars  The mob in the media oh they love Governor Cuomo They treat him like he is a hero Well he failed the people of New York and he treats the president like garbage In the middle of a national crisis there is no help to the American people none  How did you not prepare The number one target of terror Unbelievable  The president you know what its all over the media as we now go through and a lot of the media mob in different ways and you know you watch on morning media what they say over there fake news Don Lemon saying his crap all over We dont go to that  But believe it or not Don Lemon pretends to be a news anchor over there and if he were an actual journalist this was an actual news organization and he goes in a partisan hack and they didnt have a leftist agenda well when his fake news network was obsessed with the impeachment witch hunt the federal government was warning Americans about the coronavirus  Heres the timeline December 27th Chinese officials World Health Organization they saw that work there was some type of pneumonia looking like virus and they didnt know what it was called yet people were getting sick  December 30th  thats when they first found out A few days later January 6th the federal government started issuing warnings It wasnt labeled corona until January 7th  Follow these dates January 20 CDC its emergency operations center January 31st 10 days after the first known US case President Trump issued that travel ban and conducted a mandatory quarantine is followed  Look at your screen every step of the way the administration took unprecedented aggressive action and got the crap kicked out of it  racist xenophobic hysterical fearmongering  Think about it this way Dr Anthony Fauci  he served six presidents This guy has been a champion of fighting pandemics and HIV and I mean that Highly respected And you know one of the most trusted experts in the field  Dr Fauci didnt realize the true threat of the virus on January 21st Take a look  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE Bottom line we dont have to worry about this one right  DR ANTHONY FAUCI DIRECTOR NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES Well you know obviously you need to take it seriously and do the kinds of things that the CDC and the Department of Homeland Security are doing but this is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about  END VIDEO CLIP  HANNITY Very well respected not to say anything bad about Dr Fauci he was lied to by the Chinese government January 26th take a look  BEGIN AUDIO CLIP  FAUCI The American people should not be worried or frightened by this Its a very very low risk to the United States but its something that we as public health officials need to take very seriously  END VIDEO CLIP  HANNITY And five days later President Trump enacted a travel ban Wow How much worse with this Ill be  Now get this just breaking tonight  yes the ever so clueless and out of touch quid pro quo Joe Remember him Hes you know running those bad podcasts of his TV podcasts Initially called the ban xenophobic hysterical and fearmongering  Look at this news Yes Joe Biden now supports the presidents travel ban with China Thats two months and three days too late Joe  Now every Democrat running for office needs to be asked the same question You people in the mob and the media asking him now in retrospect was Donald Trump right This was bold this was unprecedented untold thousands of Americans didnt contract the virus and many others didnt die  And China lied to the world Thats why Dr Fauci didnt know Its not his fault but still the president got it right five days later They lied about the number of cases the amount of deaths the way the disease has spread they blocked US researchers more researches important The World Health Organization spread their lies and propaganda They were a disgrace we should have nothing to do with them down the line  One study in the US found China had been honest sooner that study 95 percent of all of this could have been prevented  The mob in the media they dont care about truth Theyre just worried about scoring cheap political points as demonstrated by fake news Acosta today Take a look  BEGN VIDEO CLIP  REPORTER Where is Dr Fauci  TRUMP I dont know but every time you asked that question whenever hes not here look you say where is he and youll say is there a problem No problem whatsoever  Every time hes not here Sometimes Ill ask him to come because thats the first question that you and a couple of others from the fake news establishment ask is where is Dr Fauci Were doing great  END VIDEO CLIP  HANNITY Here with more Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy  You know China horrible Joe Biden now supports the travel ban the xenophobic one really A little late Joe  REP KEVIN MCCARTHY RCA Well the thing I see Sean the presidents action about stopping the flight from China saved millions of lives What we need to be focused on right now is the health of the American public and what youre watching what the president is doing is hes taken leadership day in and day out to make that happen  We need to be working together unlike what Speaker Pelosi is doing She now wants to create a new commission to oversee this when in the CARES Act it created three oversight committees already A pandemic one made up of inspector generals thats headed by Glenn Fine we got an appointment by the president confirmed by the Senate for five years another individual to oversee it and then we have a congressional special committee to oversee it thats appointed by every leader inside Congress  She needs to focus on helping If you really want to know why shes doing it look who she wants to appoint to this ph  HANNITY Let me ask you this  MCCARTHY Yes  HANNITY First they withheld money INAUDIBLE Americans hospitals workers needed for the Humanities and all those crap And now they are starting another investigation This is how sick they are Because thats   that is like psychosis on a level I cant even describe during a national health emergency  MCCARTHY Sean I wondered when I saw that number this week that 6 million more Americans lost their jobs how many of them could have kept their job had Nancy Pelosi not held this up You know today when we took out for small business just starting the program unheard of that it was this fast 5 billion got processed for small business today That could have been a week ago had Nancy Pelosi not held this up  HANNITY Yes Now they want another investigation They dont want to wait in the middle of a national emergency Ive never seen anything this sick in Washington and that says a lot  Kevin McCarthy thank you Appreciate you being with us  MCCARTHY Thank you  HANNITY Up next we are going to hold China accountable You know why Because this all could have been prevented  Also Dr Fauci says it is quote mindboggling that the wet markets still are operating there Well have that report  Dr Oz on the medical breakthrough and the hope  what is available straight ahead  COMMERCIAL BREAK  HANNITY All right Now the coronavirus is exposing deeprooted corruption lies outright propaganda in China Calls ramping up to shut down the country what they call a wet market exotic animal markets that are believed to be the direct cause of our current pandemic  Listen to Dr Fauci from earlier today  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  FAUCI I think they should shut down those things right away I mean it just  it boggles my mind how when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human animal interface that we dont just shut it down I dont know what else has to happen  END VIDEO CLIP  HANNITY The disease in fact originated in China thats just a fact The disease first rapidly spread in China thats a fact China lied to you and to the entire world that is a fact  We have this pandemic in large part because of their deception and the deception of their cohorts spreading their lives and propaganda from the World Health Organization These lies hurt the world They lied and people around the world died China should be compensating the victims families all over the world for the destruction and the chaos they helped cause  And tonight Senator Marsha Blackburn has another idea have Beijing waived some of the US debt as well  Joining us now for reaction is the senator along with China expert Gordon Chang  Senator I agree they lied to the world You know I played Dr Fauci Dr Fauci was being lied to by the world You know   SEN MARSHA BLACKBURN RTN Well what we know is that China  the Communist Party knew that they had this virus They knew it for 51 days and Sean as I have talked to some of the activists who are fighting against the Communist Party in China they have said it was unprecedented  They knew they had this But to protect the party and to protect the Chinese New Year and a celebration they tried to keep it quiet and then they had an outbreak  And of course they should compensate us They should waive some of their debt ph They should compensate these victims and these families where they have lost family members because of their deception because they lied because they were not transparent they refused the help of the CDC and the WHO and they should be making compensation  And of course Gordon Chang knows that better than anybody He is one of our experts on this issue  HANNITY Yes Dr Chang  GORDON CHANG CHINA EXPERT Yes certainly   CROSSTALK  HANNITY I cant introduce you any better than she did  LAUGHTER  CHANG Well thank you Senator  Yes and she is absolutely correct China actually knew sometime maybe the second week of December that there were human to human transmissions It didnt actually acknowledge this until January 20th and during that time this virus spread out of China  This wouldve been a local outbreak contained in Wuhan were it not for the actions of the Communist Party And the senator is absolutely right  one way or another China must pay It should just voluntarily contribute its holding up treasuries back to us and if not we should be working in conjunction with the other major issuers of currencies around the world to seize their obligations  If we do this in connection with the holders of pounds Swiss francs euros and yen we have a solution  HANNITY Well you know look at this point we dont know I would like to know that were getting real data  Do we have any idea if theyre telling us the truth now Senator  BLACKBURN We do not know but its interesting as Ive talked to the activists this week they are watching the individuals going to the funeral homes to receive the urns the bodies the ashes of those that have lost their lives and they are watching that as the funeral homes have open their doors  I think a week from now we will have a better idea and Sean as we look forward on how we respond to this you know President Trump has done a great job managing this rescue and moving us to recovery We need to begin to talk about an exit strategy We need to be talking about how we are going to bring manufacturing back to the United States how we bring our pharmaceutical manufacturing back and our supply chains and that is also a way that we can make China pay  HANNITY All right I want to thank you both Well follow the story more closely  BLACKBURN Absolutely  HANNITY Sad  the world would have opened their doors We had Secretary Pompeo said we would have sent our best people but they lied to us They lied to the world  People died Could have been prevented a lot of this could have been prevented  When we came back the president spoke again today about hydroxychloroquine at the task force briefing Dr Oz joins us with a medical update to keep you and your family safe You dont want to miss that  Also big news on convalescent plasma well tell you about that straight ahead  COMMERCIAL BREAK  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies and the treatment and prevention of the virus and we will keep the American people fully informed of our findings Hydroxychloroquine I dont know its looking like its having some good results I hope that would be a phenomenal thing but we have it right now and approximately now its increased to 1500 people  We have a tremendous supply of it weve ordered it in the case that it works and they could have some pretty big impacts Well see what happens  END VIDEO CLIP  HANNITY All right The president earlier today talking about hydroxychloroquine and those studies The mob and the media well the ones who have beaten me for discussing any possible treatment are now backtracking very quickly because after initially mocking the president and anyone who talked about it for suggesting hey theres some evidence here antimalarial drug journalists are now acknowledging oh it might be able to treat coronavirus  Here now the host of  well what is a must watch TV Dr Oz is with us  You know there was a 2005 study SARS was very similar SARS was a coronavirus 2005 that showed promising results  Two questions and Im just going to hand this off to you  MEHMET OZ MD THE DR OZ SHOW HOST Yes  HANNITY One is   OZ Right  HANNITY  people are scared tonight talk about what the real chances of death are for example and talk about what we know about hydroxychloroquine sir  OZ Lets talk about the medications first because they were two really good ideas that are out there one just approved by the FDA for widespread use which is convalescent plasma which you touched on earlier and the other is this hydroxychloroquine And the interesting thing about hydroxychloroquine as its been around for a while its an old malaria drug so its been studied a lot  And they used it right after the SARS epidemic hit in 2002 and in cell cultures primate cultures fairly sophisticated studies it seemed to inhibit the ability of the virus to enter cells It seems to change the hospitality of the cell to the virus and it also probably changes the immunoresponse to the virus once its in the cell All of that excitement never resulted in much because the SARS went away  But now its been used in several different settings I spoke to with Didier Raoult the wellrespected French physician who did some of that early work that alerted a lot of us to this reality And hes up to a thousand patients now in Marseilles Hes an outspoken gentleman and hes going to talk next week when he pulls the data together but he thinks it is heading in the right direction  But thats not a controlled study This week when the controlled study came out I thought thered be a sort of an embrace of it because they have to see significant improvement with less fever less coughing and improvement significant improvement in pneumonia all again statistically significant  It sort of slipped away and I think we need a little humbleness here Medicine advances mistake by mistake So masks theyre back right I mean go figure  Masks make sense Obviously people in hospitals wear them for a reason We dont have enough in hospitals but the CDC very wisely says put cloth on your face Its better than nothing in there some pretty good data saying significantly better than nothing  Same with this medication if we find out that it worked in a different country managed to figure it out I think its OK The fact that some of them have it in the national protocol I just learned Turkey has in their protocol other countries do as well We should be opening our minds to this idea especially with so many doctors choose it as their number one option outside this country  And then this hyper immunoglobulin concept is fantastic This is 100year old therapy It was used for the Spanish influenza the last disease as bad as this one  HANNITY Convalescent plasma  OZ Even today were shocked Convalescent plasma Dr Hannity thats right  HANNITY Yes Well what I mean by that so people may not know So in other words you contract the disease you build antibodies you recover OK you donate your plasma then they infuse the plasma into patients that are very sick and with the antibodies and we are seeing positive results there  OZ Well JAMA our biggest journal had a nice paper of five fake patients who are deathly ill being primarily used for patients already on a ventilator Theyre the sickest of the sick and four of the five of them have done well from what I understand One of them  were not sure about  But now the FDA is saying go out and just use this And lots of hospitals has organized this Americas good at this Thats going to make this into something that can work for hundreds of hospitals so everyone is encouraged to go to the blood bank You ought to donate anyway  I havent left my basement in two weeks except wants to go with my family to donate blood because we need blood America So why you give them if youve already had COVID19 donate some of your plasma It will give it to someone who is barely holding on just the precipice of life and doesnt want to fall into the dark abyss help that person up with your immunoglobulin They save your life you can save theirs  HANNITY Let me ask you quickly a lot of people are afraid tonight you said something is on the radio show that give perspective in the last minute we have the prospective part of course were vigilant but the perspective in terms of most people that get it Ill let you take it from there  OZ Fifty percent of the people we believe who have COVID19 have no symptoms and dont even know theyre sick The remaining people lets take those guys 40 percent of them have pretty minor illnesses I mean they know theyve got it and theyre not happy about it they felt kicked around but they recover without too much difficulty  Then the next 10 percent end up going to the hospital Of them all right of them a quarter go to the ICU and of them about half get intubated get the breathing tube And thats the group we are most worried about But everybody else does pretty well  So its a serious illness we deal with it Im dealing with it Ive lost patients with it I understand the pain that causes but the vast majority of Americans are going to do fine with the illness but we have to be hypervigilant to make sure we protect the folks who are most prone to lose for us  losing them If they do that   CROSSTALK  OZ Well be a team  HANNITY Last question look I dont want to drag you into my political world because youre a doctor and I know youre up 24 hours a day you dont sleep Youre talking to doctors around the world Can we please release the hydroxychloroquine to patients in New York without forcing  Nevada saying theyre forcing them in the overburden hospital system do you  Andrew Cuomo please Ill say it nicely let people get to their pharmacy in consultation with their doctors  OZ You know early on I understand what the concern was It was folks with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis couldnt get their medications Were pumping a lot more pills into the system It doesnt make sense for the governor to restrict it anymore Plus doctors want to prescribe it I know personally because weve had quite a few patients in New York who want it Dont make them do illegal things to get medications they believe maybe helpful Will it work We need larger trials but for now its the best tool we have it seems  HANNITY OK Well said We would love to have a clinical trial that takes three years and improve it perfectly but we dont have time Lives are in jeopardy now  Thank you for sharing all that information  And for those who dont know I want to say this about Dr Oz Ive talked to him at 100 in the morning 200 in the morning and hes up and hes reading and hes talking and hes on FOX and Friends and hes on with us and he does my radio show and his own show Hes working hard for the country Thank you  Coming up Democrats reportedly worried about their chances in November they have good reason to You wont believe the latest Biden blunder oh and Joe Bidens campaign said tonight they support the presidents travel ban to China A little late guys  straight ahead  COMMERCIAL BREAK  HANNITY The ever confused Joe Bidens basement broadcasts theyre at worst by the second more stumbling rambling incoherence Heres the latest installment and by teh way now supports Trumps travel ban thats xenophobic racist and fearmongering  Take a look  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  UNIDENTIFIED MALE What is President Trumps level of culpability Whats his level of responsibility say toward the illness and fatalities we are witnessing every few minutes these days  JOE BIDEN D PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE I put it slightly differently What is his responsibility and what  if there was you know in allocating responsibility is you know his  Ill let history do that  We need to get direct cash relief payments out to as many people as possible as quickly as possible Again this may sound straightforward but no American should have to wait a single minutes of Donald Trump put his signature on a physical check  END VIDEO CLIP  HANNITY OK and get this after calling it xenophobic and hysterical and fearmongering Joe tonight says he supports the presidents bold decision Oh Joe  OK You are two months and three days too late How much worse would it have been  Former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce  I literally watched tonight Tammy is laughing Ill go with you Tammy Im like its not funny because he  I wouldnt have even said it at this point because its so ridiculously late  TAMMY BRUCE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR It is but you know what this shows you is the impact of identity politics how it crushes leadership Joe Biden at that point was placating and pandering to individuals who wanted to hear about racism and issues of identity and thats where he went It kept him from being able to look at the issue itself  Donald Trump gets into trouble because he leads because he makes decisions based on whats in front of him and whats best for the American people Very often that is going to conflict with identity politics and the agenda of the left but he is free to do it So when we are looking at really any individual who still feels that they belong has leaders in the Democratic Party and will pander to that framework of identity politics it makes a dynamic like this involving foreign policy almost impossible to address  So this is what when we think about the election in November this is about leadership We know that the American people are responding well to what the president is doing regarding the virus and I think that its this kind of decision that separates out President Trump from anyone the Democrats would be choosing for November  HANNITY Its incalculable Reince how much worse this would be exponentially worse how many thousands and thousands of Americans would have contracted it how many would have died  Joe youre clueless youre confused and youre late  Your reaction  REINCE PRIEBUS FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF Well I mean one of the biggest problems that Joe Biden is having its whats called the enthusiasm gap in politics and I think most of the listeners know what Im talking about These are the very excited people within your party that want to get behind you put up the yard signs go wild for you  Joe Biden is at 24 percent as of last week To give you a perspective Hillary Clinton around the same time was up 46 percent He is nearly over 20 points   HANNITY And they try to kick them out and put someone else in there  PRIEBUS I dont know but every time Joe Biden opens his mouth the enthusiasm goes down The only thing he needs to do is be quiet and show up at the convention and show up in October and find out how all this turns out  The president has all of this on his shoulders the world economy the health of the country all the decisions coming up in the next few weeks with the doctor saying one thing the business leader saying another They cant get any more important and lonely for the president than where we are today but yes Joe Biden is obviously out to lunch  HANNITY Thank you both  BRUCE And right now the right man at the right time is the White House  HANNITY When we come back  I got to roll though Tammy hard break got to break  Thoughts of the week straight ahead  COMMERCIAL BREAK  HANNITY All right As I said that the start of the show only one month ago Super Tuesday a lot of change has happened last month Never forget theyre not worse land of the free home of the brave Were going to get through it A couple tough weeks  Let your heart not be troubled Laura is next Have a great weekend See you Monday "},

District He listed off a number of pandemics that had happened within his lifetime before comparing the responses to those pandemics with the response to the coronavirus pandemic I am 63 years old  out of all these pandemics that I lived through never once did they shut down our schools Never once were we confined to our house he said One has to wonder is this as bad as it is Baker pondered I have a compromised immune system so I should be the first one to be concerned  I have never taken any precautions  Im saying thats my choice Another speaker who identified herself as a small business owner talked about the burden on small businesses that have been declared nonessential before imploring Evers to end the shutdown Governor Evers end this nightmare We need to open the doors to our businesses now she said Protesters followed those comments by chanting Open up open up Yet another speaker who said she is a nurse noted that the coronavirus is dangerous and many people at the rally could potentially know someone who has caught it But she asked are the actions taken being justified No the crowd responded Are the consequences of it justified by the severity of it she asked How many freedoms are you willing to hand over to the government to save your health No the protesters answered to the former None they said to the latter The protest movement those in Wisconsin joined Friday started with demonstrations in North Carolina and Michigan and has now spread to New York Ohio Virginia and more with more protests slated for the coming days even as federal and state officials are warning that rolling back virus mitigation efforts too soon will lead to even more coronavirus cases and set back the nations response to the pandemic Those protesters have largely been from the conservative side of the political spectrum often wearing Make America Great Again hats and toting Trump flags But Trump himself has released guidelines that would reopen the country slowly We can begin the next front in our war which we are calling Opening Up America Again Trump said during a press briefing at the White House last week as he unveiled his plan to reopen the economy To preserve the health of Americans we must preserve the health of our economy But he added We are not opening all at once but one careful step at a time Still Trump tweeted support for multiple rallies in states run by Democratic governors as Wisconsin is LIBERATE MINNESOTA one read LIBERATE MICHIGAN read another LIBERATE VIRGINIA and save your great 2nd Amendment It is under siege a third said But even states with Republican governors have cautioned against opening up their economies immediately Texas Republican Gov Greg Abbott while previewing an executive order he later issued to help reopen the Texas economy said it would not be a rush the gates everybody is able to suddenly reopen all at once We have to understand that we must reopen in a way in which we are able to stimulate the economy while at the very same time ensuring that we contain the spread of COVID19"},

Dr Deborah Birx of the White House Coronavirus Task Force  \nDoctor welcome back to Fox News Sunday DR DEBORAH BIRX WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE COORDINATOR Thank you \n  \nWALLACE A month ago you and President Trump were both talking about a total of 16000 COVID19 deaths Take a look \n  \nBEGIN CLIP \n  \nDONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA It looks like well be about a 60000 mark which is 40000 less than the lowest number thought of \n  \nBIRX Look at how much the model has changed in just a week Remember just a week ago it was 80000 Now its 60000 \n  \nEND CLIP \n  \nWALLACE Early this coming week were going to reach 100000 deaths from the coronavirus and those models that you were citing now talk about close to 150000 deaths by August What happened Doctor \n  \nBIRX I think a few things are together So from the beginning and I think when we had that first briefing we talked about 12 million to 24 million and 100000 to 240000 people succumbing to this incredibly aggressive virus Those are the figures that we continue to stand by in this first wave and really understanding how to prevent future hospitalizations and future deaths is really what were focused on every single day \n  \nWALLACE But to press it a little bit a month ago you were saying we were going to come down below the low end of the model which is 100000 to 240000 to 60000 So I guess my question is in this last month did you underestimate the strength of the virus Did we reopen too soon Did we reopen without sufficient restrictions \n  \nBIRX What I was saying in that briefing that you were talking about is what that current model was showing There are different models we have been using all along and really trying to learn primarily not just for models but understanding what has happened in Spain and Italy and the UK  \nand really tracking those numbers \n  \nWe understand that our mortality rates are less than those three countries and thats really due to the incredible work of our frontline hospital workers but we understand that these number of infections has led to this level of mortality and our job now going forward is to do everything we can to prevent additional hospitalizations and additional mortality \n  \nWALLACE Well let me pick up on that Doctor because this is as we said Memorial Day weekend and people are going out more in public a lot of them are going to beaches we are running video here some people are social distancing but the picture you probably cant see on the screen right now in Venice Beach California big crowds of people some of them close together Not wearing masks How concerned are you by some of what youre seeing around the country this Memorial Day weekend \n  \nBIRX Well you know last time we spoke I was concerned about people coming together without masks even during the protests and now Im very concerned when people go out and dont maintain social distancing What do we know that has changed We now have excellent scientific evidence of how far droplets go when we speak or just simply talking to one another and we know that its important for people to socially interact but we also know its important that we have to have masks on if we are less than six feet and that we have to maintain that six feet distance \n  \nWe know being outside does help We know sun does help in killing the virus but that doesnt change the fact that people need to be responsible and maintain that distance We know youre talking to the governor from Arkansas hes made it clear that there are superspreader events when people come together because of the nature of this virus and because of asymptomatic spread And people arent intentionally spreading the virus They dont know theyre infected but they come together and theyre under that six feet and everybody who gets exposed to that person less than six feet has a chance of becoming infected \n  \nWALLACE So do you think some of this crowd of people at beaches this Memorial Day weekend is that a superspreader event \n  \nBIRX Well Friday when I discussed this during the press briefing I was really hoping to convey that very clear message to the American people We want you to be outside We know that there are ways that you can even play tennis with marked balls so youre not touching each others balls We know there is a way for you to go out and play golf and stay distanced To hike to be outside in nature to be at the beach \n  \nBut really within that is the absolute requirement because across the country we know there is still virus out there and we see what workplaces are doing to make it safe We see what nursing homes are doing to try to make it safer for their residents Lets even in public make sure that were doing everything that we need to do to make it safe for others in public \n  \nWALLACE President Trump said on Friday that he is now declaring that houses of worship are providing essential services and he wants governors to open houses of worship right away today Take a look \n  \nBEGIN CLIP \n  \nTRUMP If they dont do it I will override the governors In America we need more prayer not less \n  \nEND CLIP \n  \nWALLACE But as you know there have been a few cases  not widespread but there have been a few cases one in Arkansas some in California where people some of them asymptomatic with COVID19 go to houses of worship and spread and there are more infections and in some cases even death Is it safe to open all houses of worship across the country today \n  \nBIRX I think two things happened on Friday The president asked for the CDC to make sure there were guidelines posted to make it clear of how churches could open safely And during then the press briefing I made it clear that its very important for governors and communities to let people know where there is still high levels of virus Like it is here in Washington DC in Chicago and in LA And to really ensure that those with vulnerabilities are protected \n  \nSo although it may be safe for some to go to churches and social distance it may not be safe for those with preexisting conditions and thats why in phase one and phase two weve asked for those individuals with vulnerabilities to really ensure that they are protected and sheltering in place while we open up America \n  \nWALLACE Then there are the issue of masks which we touched on before and we are seeing growing confrontations For instance in stores where customers say youve got to wear a mask and some customers say you are violating my rights Heres an example of that \n  \nBEGIN CLIP \n  \nUNKNOWN Im asking this member to put on a mask because that is our company policy So either wear the mask  \n  \nUNKNOWN And Im not doing it because I woke up in a free country \n  \nEND CLIP \n  \nWALLACE Im asking you a public health question not a legal question  \nWhat would you tell someone who says I have a right not to wear a mask in public \n  \nBIRX What we have said to people is theres clear scientific evidence now by all the droplet experiments that happened and that others have done to show that a mask does prevent droplets from reaching others And out of respect for each other as Americans that care for each other we need to be wearing masks in public when we cannot social distance Its really critically important We have the scientific evidence of how important mask wearing is to prevent those right droplets from reaching others \n  \nWALLACE Do you wish  I understand its a special case  hes a  everybody around him has been tested and obviously he is on television but both from a safety point of view and from a public messaging point of view do you wish the president wore a mask in public \n  \nBIRX Well the president did wear a mask while he was less than six feet in an occasion where that was important over  I think when he was traveling last week I think he  Im not with him every day and every moment so I dont know if he can maintain social distance Ive asked everybody independently to really make sure that youre wearing a mask if you cant maintain the six feet Im assuming that in a majority of cases hes able to maintain that six feet distance \n  \nWALLACE Finally there were some promising reports this week about we might get a vaccine sooner than we expected Heres the president on that this week \n  \nBEGIN CLIP \n  \nTRUMP Were looking to  when I say quickly were looking to get it by the end of the year if we can Maybe before We are doing tremendously well \n  \nEND CLIP \n  \nWALLACE A month ago you and Dr Fauci were both talking about it taking \n12 to 18 months to get a mask  to get a vaccine Now youre talking about possibly by the end of the year which would cut that timeline in half I understand everybody wants it How likely is it that we are going to see a vaccine readily available by the end of this year \n  \nBIRX I think what would make it potentially possible is what the president has asked everyone to do in this publicprivate partnership with funding directly to make vaccine at risk and what do I mean by that That means making vaccine before we know its full safety and its full effect and what we call its efficacy profile To make vaccines starting now as quickly as possible so when there is that efficacy and safety signal  so were not shortcutting the efficacy and safety testing what we are shortcutting is the normal development time of manufacturing \n  \nAnd so really starting manufacturing what would be six months early seven months early thats how you could potentially shorten this by four to six or even eight months And so thats whats happening now its taking the most promising candidates and getting them into manufacturing ensuring that you can scale and produce these vaccines at the level that is needed for Americans \n  \nWALLACE Well we all hope that happens you can be sure \n  \nDr Birx thank you Thanks for your time this holiday weekend Please come back Up next all 50 states are now in some form of reopening but life remains far from normal across the US Well check on how things are going in Arkansas with Governor Asa Hutchinson Thats next COMMERCIAL BREAK WALLACE This week Arkansas saw its biggest single day increase in coronavirus cases The news comes as the state expands the type of activities allowed to soon include overnight summer camps and kids sports Joining us now from Little Rock Governor Asa Hutchinson Governor you met with President Trump at the White House this week and you said to him in Arkansas were back to work Now I want to put up some examples of that You never issued a stayat home order in your state and now youve officially reopened all your stores restaurants movie theaters and gyms although at reduced capacity Governor whats your thinking about all that GOV ASA HUTCHINSON R ARKANSAS Well my thinking is that we have to manage the risk We take the virus very seriously Its a risk it causes death But you cant cloister yourself in a home That is just contrary to the American spirit And we have to discipline ourselves We have to manage the risk I make the comparison with  you know you can be in an automobile and its very risky but you manage the risk by wearing a seat belt At first everyone resisted wearing a seat belt and said well thats a matter of freedom Well it is but its also a matter of safety And so we are managing the risk in Arkansas We are expanding our economy  \nBut right now we have less than 100  we have less than 100 hospitalizations Our death rate is low compared to the rest of the country It doesnt diminish the seriousness in which we take it but we have to manage the risk grow our economy We have to come back and not just in Arkansas but nationally because this virus is deadly but its going to be with us a while We have to manage that risk WALLACE I want to talk about managing the risk because you have not followed the White House guidelines which called for a steady decline for two weeks in the number of new cases in the state before they could go to each new phase phase one phase two I want to put up two charts This is the number of new COVID cases in Arkansas each day since March 1st and instead of a steady downward trend folks looking at the graphic you can see its going up and down like the stock market and you had your highest that big spike on the right there you had your highest single day of cases just this past Thursday And I want to show another chart which shows the number of cases since a week ago Friday from 181 cases last Sunday to 54 cases last Monday and then as we say up to 455 cases on Thursday Which raises the question do you really have the virus under control in Arkansas HUTCHINSON Well if you look at those graphs that you see its really hard to see any period of time where youve got two spikes and one spike was about 30 days ago and then you had a decline in the cases and thats when we reopen It is important to note that theres two criteria for phase one One is the 14day decline in the number of cases The other one is a decline in a positivity rate If you look at our positivity rates 10 percent is the national standard you try to get to Weve expanded testing in Arkansas but even with that our positivity rate has been running lower than 5 percent of all of our tests And so you manage the risk by increasing the testing You look at it as to whether the fact that weve lifted restrictions is one of the reasons for the increased number of cases and our answer is we dont see a connection there And we see it because we are testing more and were following and tracing where those are coming from and theyre not coming from the fact that weve lifted some of the restrictions For example many of them come from the food supply industry which is an essential service nobody ph closes down anyway and we cant And so youve got to manage the risk and we did we believe comfortable in terms of meeting the criteria to go to phase one WALLACE Lets talk about it because obviously for you and for governors across the country its a balance You said just yesterday at a press briefing that Arkansas is experiencing a second peak in new cases and you talked for instance about a swim party in north Arkansas where a bunch of kids were together and there was a spread of the virus So is there any thought about imposing new restrictions Is it steady as she goes I mean how do you  when youve got a new peak do you respond to that in any way HUTCHINSON Certainly you do absolutely It is a concern to us and part of it is transparency with the American public with the Arkansas public and saying weve got an increase in cases here You know what of the reasons for it You know what actions should we take in response to that And to me its a matter of selfdiscipline and thats why I talked about the swim party and the fact that you can pass the virus at a swim party I dont think were going to say you cant invite anybody over to a pool in the backyard of your home I think you have to exercise discipline and make sure you have the right constraints in place And so its education And you look at the reason for the spike and again its because we have greater testing The fact that were able to trace it we want to build out infrastructure allows us  we got to think about next fall Where are we going to be Were not going to be cloistered in our home Thats contrary to the American spirit Weve got to manage the risk next fall by the infrastructure that were building now WALLACE One final question The unemployment rate in April for your state was 10 percent big sharp increase How hard hit has your state been both in terms of jobs in terms of state revenues the state budget And how long do you think its going to take you Governor to dig out HUTCHINSON Well you cant minimize the harm and the hurt to those individual employees or small businesses that lost their jobs and their income We have over 100000 employed a 102 percent unemployment rate which is 4 percent lower than the national average And so our economy is stronger than and will rebound more quickly because it was not all shut down and people are going back to work Our state revenues we predicted a 10 percent decline in April in our sales tax It was 5 percent And so were beating those numbers optimistic about coming back Its just going to take some time WALLACE Governor Hutchinson thank you Thanks for talking with us this week  weekend and we wish you and the residents of your state of Arkansas the very best sir Up next nursing homes nationwide have been especially vulnerable to the coronavirus Well ask the head of the largest association of longterm care providers how to keep the most vulnerable Americans safe COMERCIAL BREAK WALLACE Coming up nursing homes hit hard by the coronavirus with outbreaks across the country BEGIN VIDEO CLIP TRUMP We know that we have to protect some people much more so I think a lot of the governors have done a very very poor job on nursing homes END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Well ask a key voice representing the homes whats needed to keep residents safe COMMERCIAL BREAK WALLACE Nursing homes have borne the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in this country and some of the saddest scenes have been of seniors passing away with their families unable to be alongside them Joining us now Mark Parkinson the head of the nations largest associations of nursing homes and longterm care facilities Mr Parkinson a New York Times study found that onethird more than a third of all the deaths in this country from COVID19 have been in nursing homes and longterm care facilities Obviously the elderly are an especially vulnerable population Incidentally this wasnt just patients this was also some of the workers at that nursing homes But why beyond that vulnerability why do you think such a high percentage of all the deaths have been in these facilities PARKINSON Well Chris youre right this has been a horrible tragedy And for those of us that take care of older people our entire life its been the most unspeakable What weve learned from looking around the world is that any place where people live closely together whether its confidence or dormitories or cruise ships or nursing homes theyre particularly vulnerable And its because of one very unique feature to this virus and that is that this virus unlike any other that we fought before a person can catch it show no symptoms and yet still spread it So in January February and March when we didnt know that we have visitors coming into our buildings we had staff members in our buildings closely interacting with residents as they need to to take care of them and we were unwittingly spreading the virus within the communities Once the academic community and doctors figured out that you could be asymptomatic and carry it it was too late for a lot of people And unfortunately even then we didnt have the test to figure out who had it The good news that I can give this morning is that were now in recovery though Chris I just want to point out that  that the Trump administration just on Friday allocated 5 billion Secretary Azar Deputy Secretary Hargen  WALLACE Right PARKINSON Thats going to allow us to recover and really make this better WALLACE I want to point out another issue however The Government Accountability Office issued a report this week and I want to put the numbers up on the screen If found that 82 percent of nursing homes over 13000 have been cited for infection control issues from 2013 to 2017 PARKINSON Yes WALLACE So  so the question Mr Parkinson didnt your facilities have a problem in this particular area long before the pandemic hit PARKINSON Well we have a real flawed survey system And one of the flaws of the survey system is that surveyors are encouraged to give deficiencies  \nAnd what that does is it creates the impression that even very good buildings are not good It makes it hard for consumers to figure out what buildings are good and which arent when everybody gets deficiencies That same GAO report reported that 99 percent of those deficiencies were not severe They did not affect patient safety And many of them were just paperwork issues The reality is that the coronavirus violates all of the normal concepts of infection control because normal infection control is symptom related Now that we know that we are adjusting our behavior and that is why were starting to see recovery and people actually getting better Visitors are no longer allowed to come into building Every interaction patients and staff now have masks on Patients residents are not eating together in the same room theyre eating privately in our own rooms so that now that we understand the very vicious nature of this virus were able to control it much better WALLACE Nursing homes in New York and New Jersey have been especially hardhit by the pandemic as well as the entire state And in late March Governor Cuomo issued an order that nursing homes must accept Covid19 patients to try to alleviate and prevent overcrowding at hospitals Heres how the governor described it and explained it this week BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GOV ANDREW CUOMO DNY The CDC guidance said a nursing home cannot discriminate against the Covid patient because at that time the issue was hospital capacity right Remember hospital capacity And we were dramatically increasing hospital capacity END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Did Governor Cuomo have to follow that CDC guidance or did he have a choice And what about other governors and how they handle the CDC guidance around the country PARKINSON Well look I  Ive been a governor in the time of a crisis so I understand that sometimes you have to make decisions based on incomplete information And the time that Governor Cuomo made that decision he was being told by the epidemiologists that his hospitals were going to be overrun with Covid patients In hindsight we now know that that was not the case There was actually the capacity there They didnt need to be discharged to nursing homes In hindsight it was an error And to Governor Cuomos credit he has now reversed that policy Fortunately we were able to convince most of the other governors across the country to not institute that policy And I think thats part of the reason that were starting to see recovery WALLACE But in fact he did have a choice He didnt have to follow the CDC guidance anyway PARKINSON Yes I mean in hindsight you know our suggestion to him at the time was that he dont  didnt do that I think in hindsight he would say that it was an error It was an error again based upon incomplete and inaccurate information The country was too concerned with hospitals being overrun and there were consequences to that One of the consequences is that nursing homes were left out Our residents were not a high priority for testing We werent given the equipment that we needed You know there needs to be some accountability for all of these people that were making these fantastic estimates that the entire hospital system across the country was going to be overrun It wasnt and there are consequences  \nAnd unfortunately nursing home residents were one of the consequences WALLACE I  I want to pick up on the first point you made which is that we didnt know at the very beginning a lot of the particularly terrifying and dangerous aspects of the coronavirus And one of them is that people could be asymptomatic and  and go into a hospital without any sign their ill and then still spread the virus to these very sick people The result as youve locked down is weve seen these terrible scenes where for their own good residents are kept away from their families at some of them get very sick some of them pass away and their families cant be with them when that happens What are your thoughts about reopening nursing homes letting families be with the residents and under what structures under what restriction so that the families can be together but youre not endangering the lives of  \n of all the patients inside these facilities PARKINSON Right Yes we  we realize how hard its been for family members and for residents to not be able to be together And you know weve tried to offer FaceTime and all sorts of other alternatives but theres just no alternative to being together And then the tragic scenes of people dying without their loved ones its just  its  its horrible The most important thing is that we need to keep Covid down in the communities that the nursing homes are in If youre in a nursing home thats in a community that has very little Covid theres not that huge risk of it getting into the buildings If we spiked back up in Covid cases though were going to end up with more Covid in nursing homes So issue one is lets keep Covid down in the communities Issue two is lets get adequate testing so that we can get a test for every staff member every resident And then ideally if we could get onsite testing throughout the summer so that when people come and they get a test we know that theyre Covidfree that would be the ideal But we do recognize its extremely important to get these folks back with their families WALLACE Mr Parkinson thank you Thanks for taking time out to talk with us this weekend And good luck in your efforts to reopen these nursing homes sir PARKINSON Thank you very much WALLACE Up next well bring in our Sunday group to discuss Joe Bidens surprising comments about whos black and who isnt COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOE BIDEN D PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE If you have a problem figuring out whether youre for me or Trump then you aint black Ive never ever ever take the AfricanAmerican community for granted I shouldnt have been such a wise guy END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Joe Bidens controversial comments about the black vote this Friday morning and then later that day walking those comments back And its time now for our Sunday group Senator Mitch McConnell former chief of staff Josh Holmes former Democratic Party Chair Donna Brazile and Jonah Goldberg editor of The Dispatch Jonah I think its fair to say that some of the reaction some of the outrage coming from various people about Bidens remarks is largely for show by people who have said even more offensive things about African Americans during their political careers But would you agree that the  the Biden remark was pretty dumb JONAH GOLDBERG EDITORINCHIEF THE DISPATCH AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR  \nYes No it was  its  it was precisely the kind of thing that a lot of Democrats are worried about Biden doing again and again on the campaign trail Regardless of the context of you know identity politics and blacks and the Democratic Party just his sort of  almost his insecurity to have to take everything to 11 and go just a bit further than the facts or  or rationality sometimes allow makes a lot of people very  very nervous about Biden And then the specifics of it is just  its  its  its perfect fodder for the people who want to heighten the tensions on the Democratic Party in all sorts of ways And were going to see more of this over the summer WALLACE Donna I know as a lifelong and committed Democrat that you are going to rush to Joe Bidens defense But two questions First of all just on the merits itself wasnt it  wasnt the remark offensive And from a political point of view doesnt it play right into an argument the president and a lot of Republicans are making that  that it seems to show Democrats take black votes black support for granted DONNA BRAZILE FORMER DNC CHAIR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Well you know Chris before I became a Democrat I was an American and I was born black in the segregated south So I understand being black from the ground up But heres what I do believe I believe that Joe Biden was incorrect in  in saying the statement you aint black But I also believe that his apology was sufficient Here we live in a  in a country where thousands of people have died And a disproportionate number of them are people of color AfricanAmericans communities of color And so I would rather spend more time talking about the  the  the disparities that we have seen that have been amplified during this pandemic then speaking about Joe Biden and his record of blackness This is not just an issue of race this is an issue of survival right now  \nAnd I hope that Joe Biden has learned his lesson his advisors have also learned their lesson that you just not  you cannot be cavalier in talking about these issues Stay  stick to the facts Thats what the radio hosts want him to do Talk about the issues because the issues mattered now more than ever WALLACE Josh Donald Trump at 8 percent  8 percent of the vote  the AfricanAmerican vote running against Hillary Clinton in 2016 Now hes making a bigger push for that this time talking about his support for historically black colleges about the very low until we got the virus very low unemployment rate among minorities including blacks Does he really expect to get a significantly bigger portion of the African American vote or is this more a place to try to show moderate suburban voters Republican voters perhaps that hes not racially divisive JOSH HOLMES FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO MITCH MCCONNELL AND PRESIDENT AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF CAVALRY No I mean look the presidents campaign has made this a central issue for many months If you talk to Jared Kushner and others within the White House theyll  theyll say that this has been a top priority for a long time to try to court more AfricanAmerican voters Look I think this whole episode as Joe Biden often does he just perfectly articulated the Trump campaigns central thesis for earning the black vote which is Democrats have taken the vote for granted Rather than going out and trying to earn the votes of black Americans theyve basically assumed it And I think they would say that conversely the Trump campaign once they get  once the president was given the opportunity he passed things like you know criminal justice reform which is a longstanding priority of the black community something that the Democrats have had an opportunity to do for a long time it havent You mentioned the  the economic component Again I think what the Trump campaign would say is that those historically high employment numbers that weve had up until February now compromised by Covid19 are something hes uniquely able to do Hes uniquely able to bring jobs back to minority communities And I think theyve  they believe its a very very strong argument WALLACE I want to turn to something else now and thats the new White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany She held a briefing on Friday And this is right after President Trump said he would override governors if they didnt open houses of worship right away A number of reporters asked on what basis under what authority the president could override governors and make them open houses of worship and that led to this exchange Take a look BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KAYLEIGH MCENANY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY The guidelines QUESTION Whats the specific provision of federal law that allows the president to override a governors decision MCENANY The president will strongly encourage every government to allow their churches to reopen And buy its interesting to be in a room that desperately wants to seem to see these churches and houses of worship stay closed QUESTION No but the president said that he has a  MCENANY Yes INAUDIBLE QUESTION Kayleigh I object to that I mean I go to church Im dying to go back to church END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Donna I spent six years in the White House Briefing Room covering Ronald Reagan I have to say I never  and in the years since too I never saw a White House press secretary act like that BRAZILE You know I  I know Kayleigh and I  I think shes an extraordinary person But this combative  this  this  this posture that she has taken into the job I dont think is the right posture I would hope that she could tone it down a little bit And we all believe that as not just journalists but as individuals we should be respected regardless of where we  where we sit And I  I just thought that that was inappropriate the way she went back assuming that many of the people sitting in that room did not care about houses of worship We want to all return back to normal whatever that means anymore but we want to do so in a safe way in a way that dont harm ourselves and  and those around us WALLACE And then McEnany who has been in the White House for a few weeks started lecturing reporters telling reporters who have been covering politics for many years what questions they should be asking in this case about Michael Flynn Take a look at this BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KAYLEIGH MCENANY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY If I write them out in a slide format maybe were visual learners and you guys will follow up with journalistic curiosities Why was Lieutenant General Michael Flynn unmasked Not by the intel community entirely but by Obamas chief of staff by the former vice president Joe Biden by Susan Rice by the Treasury secretary I mean this is extraordinary END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Jonah first of all its not extraordinary Unmasking is pretty routine the effort by people in an administration to find out who a masked American person is It  it happens in the  in the Trump White House It happened I think 16000 times the year before last Whats  whats a crime is leaking it But unmasking isnt In addition to which I have to say that if Kayleigh McEnany had told Sam Donaldson and me what questions we should ask that would not have gone well Jonah GOLDBERG Yes look Im  its nice to see Donna so deferential to Kayleigh McEnany I think her behavior is indefensible and grotesque And I think that what she has done is she has  you know the sixth  theres this cliche in Washington that President Trump wants Roy Cohn as DOJ as the  at the head  as the attorney general What Donald Trump wants in a press secretary is a Twitter troll who goes on attack doesnt actually care about doing the job they have and instead wants to impress the  really an audience of one and make another part of official Washington another one of these essentially cable news and Twitter gladiatorial arenas And its  its a sign of the defining of deviancy down in our politics and its only going to make things worse WALLACE Jonah  Josh rather In the time weve got left you know the White House press secretary is always a accompanied job They work for the White House but theyre paid by taxpayers They are public officials And Kayleigh McEnany isnt acting like she is working for the public She acts like she is what she used to be which is a spokesperson for the Trump campaign HOLMES Yes look Chris I just disagree I think Kayleighs doing a nice job And whats missing from this conversation that weve had this morning is the context by which she is making these statements I think the  any spokesperson in the Trump world whether its in the White House or the campaign find themselves under constant attack by the press The confrontation nature by which journals approach the questioning is not really to obtain much information so much as to try to back them into the corner And I think Kayleigh said Im not going to play that game And so yes it is completely different than what weve seen from years and years of briefings from press secretaries but I think its reflective of the nature that we find ourselves in in WALLACE Let me just say Sam Donaldson and me in the Reagan White House we were pretty tough on the White House press secretaries and we never had our religious beliefs questioned or were lectured on what we should ask Thank you panel See you next Sunday Up next our Power Player on this Memorial Day weekend A man whos made it his lifes work
