{"4894": "On todays show   but we’re all yelling about disinfectant injections plus we have some   And Self magazine senior health editor   author of   comes through to tell us how to take care of ourselves during a pandemic Spoilers There’s no right answer and we’re all doing our best You can listen to todays episode above Also you check it out on       or wherever you listen to your favorite shows Casey Rackham Andy Cohen is calling out the FDA for discrimination Bleach dont inject it   And we talked to self senior health editor Anna Borges author of  Hayes Brown The date April 24 2020 CR The time News OClock HB Good afternoon Im Hayes Brown CR And Im Casey Rackham Welcome to   HB It is Friday We did it CR A whole week of podcasts HB Now we just have to do this forever Forever CR That is a very ambitious amount of time for us to have this podcast HB At the heat death of the universe Therell be just the void and   CR Glad to hear that theres some hope for the future HB Do you have any reflections after one whole week of this CR Honestly Ive been loving it I think before I was just like kind of getting up whenever and now I have HB Now you have a reason to wake up in the morning Im glad we provided that to you Casey CR I would just like yeah I would be like doing the first couple hours of work in my bed and now I have to get up and go to a table where a mic is So its been helpful HB All right We now turn to our daily corona update Honestly we simply cant not focus on something the president said during his daily press briefing yesterday about disinfectant and light and maybe shooting one or both into people CR Please No no HB Roll the tape President Trump And supposing you brought the light inside the body You can which you can do either through the skin or in some other way And I think you said youre going to test that too Sounds interesting Right And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute One minute And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it is a tremendous number in the lungs HB OK Theres a lot to unpack there First bottom line up front   It is not a good idea In that clip President Trump was talking to Bill Bryant the head of the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Division Bryant was talking about how bleach and sunlight and UV light killed the virus on surfaces not in people and so I encourage you to go find the video because the reactions on some of the faces as Trump was saying this are really something I would be remiss not to point out though hes not alone in touting the health benefits of bleach right now CNN anchor Chris Cuomos wife wrote on her health blog yesterday that she often added a half cup of Clorox to a full bath of warm water to “combat the radiation and metals in my system and oxygenate it” HB Thats said again bleach is not a treatment for the Coronavirus and it feels bonker to have to point that out The New York Times got some heat on Twitter earlier today for sitting in a tweet that Trump had talked about using disinfectants dangerously in the view of some experts They deleted that tweet and put out a new one apologizing and saying to be clear theres no debate on the danger Just to put a real button on things the makers of Lysol had to put out a statement basically saying we are not medicine And while some studies are being done to see what effect UV light has on treating coronavirus its kind of like how in the game telephone you start with the teachers are on strike but end up with purple monkey dishwasher White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany issued a statement today saying that of course the media would irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines And heres what the president himself had to say this morning as he signed a bill adding more than 350 billion to a fund for small businesses President Trump But I was asking a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside But it does kill it and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters HB As all of this is happening by the way today we had 50000 confirmed coronavirus related deaths in the United States and thats todays update CR That was such an insane update I mean I think everyones just been thinking about all this bleach stuff for what Like over 12 hours now I mean it is insane HB I completely agree It makes no sense but once you trail it back to like where we started which is UV and bleach kill the virus on top of things you can see almost how it went from that to maybe we put it in the people and its good CR Honestly this is also insanely ludicrous that Ive turned to Tic Tok videos of users lipsynching to Trumps bleach monologue And let me tell you it is much more soothing than reality HB I can only imagine CR OK well now its time for todays good news bad news As you might guess from the name this is where I bring you some of the most awe and some of the most oh my god no stories from around the internet HB Can we get the bad news out of the way first today CR OK bad news If youre the FDA you messed with the wrong bravo host Andy Cohen spoke out on last nights episode of   about his experience trying to donate plasma If you dont know Cohen had COVID19 last month and after he recovered he wanted to give back but he was told that he couldnt donate because of an FDA rule mandating gay men must have not slept with another man for three months before donating And if you dont know plasma from recovered people might have antibodies that could help treat coronavirus So every bit of it helps Heres how Andy put it during his show Andy Cohen Heres the thing This virus is ravaging our planet The FDA says there is an urgent need for plasma from survivors All donated blood is screened for HIV and a rapid HIV test can be done in 20 minutes or less So why the threemonth rule Why are members from my community being excluded from helping out when so many people are sick and dying Maybe because were valuing stigma over science I dont know My blood could save a life but instead its over here boiling HB Such a dumb rule at this point CR I meannot even just dumb its discrimination Has been for forever Its just that this started back in the 1980s at the height of the AIDS HIV crisis and its 40 years later and the stigma is still very much around HB Earlier this month man the FDA even changed the rule from one year you have to have been abstinent from sleeping with a guy to three months at the start of April And thats still too long a period with the tests that we have now CR It is and I think its like something really important to think about So OK 1980s it was a lifetime ban you couldnt donate blood right Now in 2015 they change it to a 12month band and now in April they just change it to three months So Im like why did It seems very arbitrary in the amount of time that theyre changing it And like you said in the 1980s its like our testing was not what it is now And so its just wild and other countries are ahead of us in this regard So Dr Monica Hahn of UC San Francisco Health was on   today and they said that countries like Italy and South Africa have moved onto whats called an individual risk assessment where they ask the same questions to everyone regarding risk behaviors regardless of their sexual orientation HB Maybe one day we too can be as advanced Italy and South Africa CR OK Now onto some much needed good news   is coming back The shows been off the air for four years but its making a one time return next week Its going to be a halfhour special starring all the original cast featuring Leslie trying to stay close to her friends during quarantine metaphorically close not literally And bonus the show will be raising money for Feeding America So you get the funny and the fundraising Between the sponsors cast producers and NBC universal theyre putting up 500000 in matching donations HB That is such good news But I got to say Im a little disappointed that its the form of a halfhour special or not a telethon because I mean it was right there It was right there for them CR And honestly theres nothing more that this country needs than like a 24hour live stream of the   cast OK But I cant wait to see what all the characters are up to it in quarantine like whos going to be doing the worst in the middle of all of this HB My prediction is its Tom Haverford because hes probably trying to blow up on Instagram live but literally no one is watching him and hes very upset by this CR No That seriously was my guess I was like he is totally struggling being in there Even though hes going to have social media hes going to struggle And I also think Andys really going to struggle because he doesnt like rules and people telling him what he can and cannot do Like I think hes going to be like not really understanding social distancing and how to wear a mask effectively and also hes just going to be bored HB This has been fanfic Friday brought to you from   CR In a minute well be talking to Anna Borges about how to make selfcare a thing when were all stressed beyond belief Be right back Welcome back Its time for say more This is where we get to talk some of the best people out there and to spending some quality time with us HB We made it through another week of stress and bad news and staying away from people and guys this shit is hard which is why its so important that we try to take care of ourselves even as were looking out for everyone else in our lives CR Were joined by an expert on the matter Anna Borges shes the senior health editor for Self magazine and author of the book   Hello Anna Anna Borges Hi HB Hi So Anna you wrote the literal book on selfcare which listeners can and should purchase from an independent bookseller Do you find that makes you feel more prepared at all for what were dealing with AB I wish Absolutely not I mean like yes through my work I have like all of these tools at my disposal Im always talking to therapists and experts and so like thus have some knowledge on what I technically should be doing But knowing in theory is not the same at actually being skilled at doing those things Like Im awful at taking my own advice on the best of days and now under these circumstances like everythings out the window CR OK So were all giant stress balls right now But the thing a lot of people turn to is selfcare and thats eating out shopping treating themselves and those arent available Why do you think so many people equate spending money with taking care of themselves AB I mean a few reasons I think for one it feels good Like who among us can deny the short term pleasure of buying yourself something nice or dropping some money on   Thats me Thats what Im doing Its like an instinct gratification thing But also theres this whole I dont know treat yourself narrative thats hard to be immune to Selfcare got tied up with consumerism pretty quickly and so people associate buying things with selfcare when for me personally at least my philosophy of selfcare is its not buying things It can be like no shame if thats what it is for you But its all of the things that we do like the fun and the not fun and the free and the money based things that we do to manage our mental health every day So its a lot more than spending money But also I know a lot of people who need something to look forward to right now so theyre purchasing things So that package arrives to break up the pandemic and I get it I totally do HB So I got to know what would you say is the worst piece of selfcare advice that youve heard lately And you dont have to name names but I also totally think you should name names AB Hayes Oh my gosh OK well dont get mad No this is going to be a total copout answer because for one like I actually cant think of anything to be fair I think selfcare can look a lot of different ways and so people are giving advice on what works for them Im not here to discount that but that said the selfcare advice that I really hate is actually like a whole genre of advice which is framing selfcare as justification to do shitty things especially to other people Like people will call anything selfcare these days People will be like I cancel on my friends all the time Im really awful I ignore people I do these things Self care and its like Im not saying you cant do those things Were all only human But like framing it as selfcare kind of plays into this narrative of why selfcare has a bad rep in the first place AB The biggest criticism or one of the many criticisms of selfcare is that its selfish and selfindulgence and yeah if your selfcare definition is these things ak shitty stuff So yeah I think thats my biggest pet peeve when I see people peddling that kind of advice under the guise of selfcare which I dont think it is CR You write a lot about mental health and depression and how to generally make your way through life without that dragging you down What are some of the resources youd recommend to people dealing with that right now AB Resources right now is kind of a tough subject because everything is kind of out the window Even the mental healthcare industry is moving completely virtual and so normally Im like Im a big supporter of therapy You should have a space to talk about yourself and go through your feelings and not have to worry about a relationship being reciprocal like it is with a friend or a partner or a family member AB So that obviously is something that Im leaning on hard right now But therapy comes with a lot of barriers to entry It requires a lot of privilege to access and so its hard to give that as advice So if you can do that do but if not short of that I always definitely recommend crisis resources like the suicide prevention lifeline or crisis text line And what I want to say about that is I think people often have this high bar of what it means to be in crisis quoteunquote and theyre like Im not going to reach out to say the suicide prevention lifeline because I dont think Im saying a danger to myself But if youre struggling right now those resources are totally available to you if you just need someone to talk to because you dont have that right now Thats what that is for HB Anna whats the best thing that youve done for yourself in the last month and a half would you say AB Do you want like the feelsy answer or like the consumeristic capitalism answer HB I would like both because Im legitimately curious what your answers are here AB OK OK So well go with the latter first which is that many people on the internet right now I am finding like great comfort and selfsoothing in   and video games in general Like Im sorry I dont want to think about the world I want to give like my little capitalism raccoon like his bells and make my island pretty and like that has been selfcare for me And I will say that I actually didnt get Animal Crossing before I got it I was kind of like this is I dont buy this This is not my typical kind of video game but it has been the savior for the pandemic Whoa But on the more feelsy side of things I will say that just in general being kind to myself has been really important And even your question speaks to like the pressure that I feel myself Im like you should know what to do now AB You should know what to take care of yourself You have these tools and like reminding myself that a lot of those arent helpful right now because were in this completely unprecedented wild situation and my CBT exercises do not stand a chance against like the anxiety spiral of the world kind of going off the rails And so just reminding myself of that is something thats been very helpful and I encourage people to kind of lower the bar and go easy on yourself and just understands that youre not equipped to deal with this And the best we can do is try our best CR I truly think that is the best advice I think my friend who also goes to therapy tells me always via text to be kind to myself and myself who also goes to therapy texts her kind to yourself because when you cant remember it for yourself its nice to have a friend tell you that Also you wrote a piece for Self called 17 Totally Normal Things to Feel Right Now According to Therapists What on that list surprised you the most and what do you think your readers most needed to hear AB I dont think anything surprised me because everything felt so valid Like even if things I hadnt thought of before as soon as the therapist was like this is coming up a lot and Im like yep sounds right Like of course people are I dont know fill in the blank Angry grieving maybe even a little relieved bored horny like all of these things everything I was like yep sounds legit So nothing was surprising but I do think that something that readers most needed to hear and that came up most was help in validating the things that they feel most guilty about I mean this is something that everyone is going through in some way and we all have various levels of privileges or dont have those privileges We are in spaces of safety or a spacious of danger AB And people are kind of grappling with their role in all of this and like where they stand and whether or not they can still work or work from home And so the thing that came up a lot was people feel guilty if they have these privileges and these levels of safety and its making everything that theyre already going through worse So I think people needed to hear that being grateful that things arent worse doesnt mean that you cant be struggling too And you should make space for the ways that youre hurting and the ways that youre struggling even if you are lucky in some aspects HB Anna this has all been like the best thing I think for people to hear on a Friday going into the weekend I really thank you so much for coming on today I really appreciate it AB Oh thank you so much for having me This was like a very nice soothing break to my day HB Good good and really quick just to make sure we provide it to anyone who needs it The national suicide prevention lifeline is 18002738255 Thats 18002738255 Anna thank you again AB Thanks Have a good one guys Good one Honestly CR Thats perfect AB Please like include that one Its kind of like were all asking each other hows it going How are you doing Because were like trained to be asking these things and were like conditioned to like have these pleasantries and like every time were like wait that is not what we do anymore HB Thats not feasible anymore AB None of us are good CR Its time for the list because if you know BuzzFeed at all you know how much we love lists and today weve got six movies to watch before they leave Netflix HB Oh perfect I have nowhere to be this weekend like every weekend on my calendar for the next however CR One day well have outdoor plans again but for now we just have our beloved TVs So without further ado here are six movies to watch before Netflix takes them away from us at the end of April Number one   Number two   Number three   Number four   Five   And number six   HB All of those movies evoked a certain sort of Oh good The world when it was nice I remember Perfect CR Yeah I want everyone to know that Hays list included   and I took that out because I dont need everyone to be in that headspace going into the week HB Thats fair Thats fair CR Hayes how dare you HB I know Im sorry CR No no but youre right All have these movies like kind of just elicit a childhood kind of nostalgia and stuff and so its just good going into it HB I probably will wind up watching   or   now this weekend Now that I know that this is my last chance for a second CR No I definitely want to see   again I havent seen it in so long and I think everyone should be I think my top three       those are all iconic Youre wrong if you tell me otherwise OK Just pure bliss HB Ive never seen   Which one is that There were like a couple of Cinderella ones at that time if I remember correctly CR You are correct but this one stars up none other than Hilary Duff Oh it is so good HB Is that the one where shes wearing the pink Chuck Taylors on the movie poster CR Yes youre correct Thats it OK Please watch it And Im also I dont want to reveal it because I dont want my queer card to be taken away but Ive never seen   And so I think HB Even Ive seen   CR I have to watch it this weekend Oh my god everyones so upset at me right now Im so sorry Listen   is very my brand I know Im going to love it I just like never saw it So nows my chance HB Yes it is CR You can find the full list of movies and TV shows leaving Netflix and the ones being added in May on buzzfeedcom the internet website HB OK We have time for one more thing because we cannot let you go until we talk about this Namely Tom Hanks being an actual angel of light CR Wait can that just be a thing we do all the time Talk about Tom Hanks HB I mean I would if we could I think theres other podcasts out there doing that and I wouldnt want to infringe upon them CR OK fair But what did he do at this time though Save a baby whale Build a drone that can bring medicine to the elderly HB Tom Hanks was nice to a little kid CR I am already delighted HB So while he was in Australia recovering from the rona an 8yearold sent him a letter hoping hes OK This kids name Corona DeVries CR Oh no What a name to have right now HB Its literally several levels because it wasnt until I was reading it just now that it hit me that DeVries also sounds a little bit like virus So just several levels of like Oh But anyway little Corona he wrote the letter to make sure the Hanks was OK but also said he was being bullied for his name and that made him sad and angry CR No Justice for little Corona HB Well Hanks didnt get the letter until after hed recovered but he wrote back to Corona using his Corona brand typewriter because again layers He told him that his name was great saying You are the only person Ive ever known to have the name Corona like the ring around the sun a crown CR Why am I crying right now That is pure poetry HB Hanks is a master of poetry As it turns out he also said and this is what got me verklempt he wrote that “youve got a friend in me” CR Oh my god my heartstrings No genuinely I think Tom Hanks could be the nicest person in the world HB Entirely I feel like if there was a metric it would have to be on a Hank some meter CR Yes exactly HB OK I would just say first off that I dont believe that Tom Hanks has done any murders for any lawyers listening but if he ever did a murder it would probably be entirely justifiable and wed all just be like Oh yeah I see it Fair CR Oh my god OK Hayes But besides murder which I hope he hasnt done what do you think the worst thing Tom Hanks has ever done in his life could be Is it like finish the cheese in the fridge and not tell his wife about it HB I mean something of that level of dastardly I would assume Like maybe he is one of those people though who Oh man maybe hes one of those people who leaves like a sip of drink left in the carton and puts it back in the fridge That could be his one thing I could see Tom Hanks having that CR That is genuinely so annoying HB It is though and I can see that CR But we forgive him HB We do We do because Thomas Hanks you are an angel of light Thank you for being so nice to Corona after having the rona CR Thats it for today Well be back on Monday with whatever highs and Lows the weekend has bestowed on us HB And remember friends bleach is not medicine   is produced by Dan Bowza and Alan Haburchak Special thanks to Tracy Eyers Mangesh Hattikudur Samantha Henig and
