apportionment counts to the president until the end of April 2021 The decennial census numbers are used to draw legislative and congressional districts States were expecting to receive this data by July 31 2021 But the bureau decided to compress its timeline ending field data collection a month early in September 2020 The deadlines for apportionment and redistricting data were slashed by four

impact of the coronavirus  New Jersey and Virginia would be receiving the data in February 2021 and would have a tight window to draw new legislative maps and carry out their elections In New Jersey voters will see an amendment on their ballot in November that would put redistricting on hold and use the current maps for 2021 if data isnt delivered by February 15 In Virginia if the data comes in too late State Senator George Barker says its likely the attorney general could be asked to approve to use Virginias current maps for 2021 rather than rushing to redraw Michael Li senior counsel at

who has not lost an election in 47 years will go on to face Republican Kevin OConnor in November but likely wont have a problem as the seat is considered safely Democratic Just a year ago Markey was already facing two challengers and was down double digits in the polls to Congressman Kennedy who had not even formally entered the race at the time Markey made the race competitive by focusing on his

personnel and look them in the eye and say thank you  Afterwards Pence held a roundtable with Mayo Clinic employees and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz I just want to say how much we appreciate Governor Tim Walz Pence said at the beginning of his remarks Last week Walz announced a partnership with Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota to significantly expand coronavirus testing in the state to about 20000 per day Pence added that his visit to Minnesota today was to celebrate a whole of America approach that Minnesota is undertaking The Mayo Clinic has not yet said why its  saying Pence had been informed about the maskwearing policy was taken down In her second of six medialive appearances Tuesday former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams joined former Labor Secretary Robert Reich to talk about voter suppression and her ambitions to be vice president   notes this was an interesting conversation because during the Democratic primary Reich praised Senators Sanders and Warren for their progressive policies  In his conversation with Abrams this afternoon Reich applauded Medicare for All and universal basic income and even asked Abrams what her response was to the young and progressive voters who are not excited by a Biden nomination  Abrams without hesitation voiced her support for Biden Joe Biden is a man not only of integrity but if you look at the policies he has espoused the ones hes adopted the way hes framed this campaign and his plan for leadership its first and foremost that hes not going to take anyone for granted Hes not going to take communities of color for granted hes not going to take young people for granted she said  And in a possible swipe at Sanders and Warrens more transformative platforms Abrams added Bidens not going to take progressives for granted But we also need someone who can get in there on day one and start navigating those spaces and getting not just the ideas out there but the policies in place Another interesting exchange took place when Reich quoted John Adams George Washingtons vice president on the vice presidency which he disparaged as the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his imagination conceived Reich said that when he worked in the Clinton Cabinet he had seen Al Gore frustrated in his role  I think people often mistake position for power and they look at titles rather than access … And I look for opportunities to not just build up but to dig deep roots My interest in serving is that I believe that Joe Biden will be a transformative president for us Abrams said Abrams who has been frank in her desire to be vice president continued to hype her resume today even citing college experience she had in relation to fighting climate change I interned for the EPA for two summers working on the issues of environmental justice I wrote my thesis in college on environmental racism and how we need to address the poorest and least resilient who face environmental challenges she said Finally Abrams commented on todays primary in Ohio and New Yorks decision yesterday to cancel its primary She praised Ohio Governor Mike Dewine for swiftly moving the primary but said more could have been done in preparation like including paidfor postage in the mailed ballots  She chastised the New York Board of Elections decision and said We may know the end of the story but no one gets to stop us from reading it Abrams made the point that cancelling the primary sends a signal that its the safest decision to not hold an election Abrams said thats the wrong message to be sending Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday announced plans to team up with Representative Alexandria OcasioCortez on a bill to stop large companies and hedge funds from overtaking smaller ones suffering financially from the COVID19 crisis  As we fight to save livelihoods and lives during the coronavirus pandemic giant corporations and private equity vultures are just waiting for a chance to gobble up struggling small businesses and increase their power through predatory mergers Warren said in a statement   says The Pandemic AntiMonopoly Act would impose a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions involving companies with over 100 million in revenue private equity companies hedge funds and companies with holding a patent for a product used during the crisis  Although antitrust agencies are tasked with defending open and fair markets by stopping anticompetitive mergers their inability to aggressively take on concentration before the crisis began has further limited the federal governments ability to respond effectively to the pandemic  The forthcoming bill would also waive waiting periods and deadlines binding antitrust agencies and order the Federal Trade Commission to establish a legal presumption against mergers and acquisitions that hinder the governments response Such measures are likely to face strong opposition particularly in the Republicancontrolled Senate but Warren plans to push for them in the next coronavirus relief package Warren also continued a push to include an Essential Workers Bill of Rights in the next coronavirus package that would add a set of protections and benefits for those on the front lines of the crisis She and Representative Ro Khanna along with five dozen other lawmakers sent their proposal to the Senate and House leaders Frontline workers — including health care workers transit workers farm workers grocery workers domestic workers and delivery workers — are risking their lives to keep America running Congress has a responsibility to protect them and their families Warren said in a statement The Senates most vocal champion for believing women in their

resign from the Senate told   Tuesday that she stood by Biden     Gillibrand about allegations about Biden at the time before the Reade allegation of assault was made public Her response then was that the Biden allegations were very different because they were complaints of discomfort not assault The women who have come forward said they felt uncomfortable They said they didnt feel it was sexual harassment or sexual in nature Gillibrand said Reade has accused Biden of forcibly touching and kissing her during her time as his Senate employee in 1993 The Biden campaign previously told CBS News

morning Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said a state code about emergencies during elections allowed the primary to be postponed Today I have certified that a state of emergency exists and requested that the governor issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring While hurricanes floods and tornadoes are at the forefront of all Louisianans minds the threat we face from the COVID19 virus is an unprecedented threat and unlike any we have faced Ardoin said In response the Democratic National Committee says the change could result in Louisiana losing at least half of its delegates due to a potential violation of their timing rule that all states hold contests by June 9 We will continue to work with every state party as they adjust their delegate selection plans around coronavirus Any violation of our rules could result in a penalty that would include a state losing at least half of its delegates This change will be reviewed by the Rules and Bylaws Committee a DNC spokesperson told CBS News  Senator Karen Carter the Louisiana Democratic Party chair said they are hopeful the DNC will work with them to revise the delegate selection plan  We want to ensure every Louisianian has the chance to make their voice heard in this election Louisiana Democrats are committed to preserving the health of our neighbors while ensuring the voices of hundreds of thousands of Louisianians are heard she said  Ardoin has also requested the general elections for municipal general elections be postponed from May 9 to July 25 The office has previously moved election dates in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina and in 2008 after Hurricane Rita State law states that a governor may take an executive order to suspend or move elections only after a recommendation

to vote by mail  Our priority is ensuring that people are healthy and safe Holding public events right now would put that in jeopardy so this is the responsible course of action Barbuto said in a statement The four states involved in next Tuesdays primaries have been signaling all week how they would approach coronavirus Secretaries of State from Arizona Florida Illinois and Ohio issued a statement on Friday that their elections will go as planned on Tuesday March 17  Unlike concerts sporting events or other mass gatherings where large groups of people travel long distances to congregate in a confined space for an extended period of time polling locations see people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration the statement said We are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday There is no legal authority for canceling an election our governor made a disaster declaration this week but even that does not give him the authority to postpone an election or move an election day thats set in statute said Illinois Secretary of State spokesperson Matt Dietrich in an interview with CBS News  All four states have been pushing their votebymail or early vote options something they usually frame as a way of convenience to avoid long lines Joe Bidens campaign also encouraged early voting in a statement on Friday  If voters are members of an atrisk population exhibiting symptoms or have been exposed to a diagnosed case of COVID19 we encourage them to explore absentee ballots and vote by mail options he said  Arizona has been promoting its curbside voting option as well as making sure polling sites receive a full cleaning and disinfecting especially in the 20 voting sites statewide that are in facilities frequented by seniors Inperson early voting here goes until Friday March 13 while all mail ballots must be received by county officials by 7 pm on March 17  We also want to remind voters to make a plan for participating in this election Arizona Secretary of State Kate Hobbs said Today is the last day we recommend people mail back their early ballots and there are still several other early voting options available for those who want to avoid potential crowds on Election Day Inperson early voting is available in Arizona until Friday March 13  In Florida votebymail ballots have to be received by no later than 7 pm on Election Day The state also offers early voting in 67 counties until Saturday March 14 though officials note some counties may opt to add in more earlyvoting days More than 204000 Democrats have voted early so far  We are working with county supervisors of elections around the clock to guarantee that those votes count and that we ensure fair and accurate elections said Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee  Ohio and Illinois have both been relocating vulnerable polling places particularly those located at senior living facilities The new Ohio locations include churches school gyms and public buildings The state also said there will be bipartisan teams of county board of elections officials to help seniors at these facilities vote without leaving the facility  Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said in a press conference Tuesday that theyve already seen more people take advantage of the early vote or votebymail options than they saw in 2016 Inperson early voting ends at 2 pm on Monday March 16  In Illinois the deadline to be sent a votebymail ballot was Thursday afternoon Dietrich said while the idea to extend this deadline was floated Wednesday the state needed to be able to allow enough time for mail ballots to be returned  If they move the deadline to tomorrow even on a Friday it is doubtful that everybody would receive their ballots in time and essentially youd have people whod lose their right to vote because theyre waiting at home for their ballot to arrive and it never comes he said Dietrich said that the state has already seen 12000 more mailin ballots returned than in 2016 Some 240000 were sent out and 65000 have already come back this year Illinois has also seen 272000 early votes cast so far more than the 246000 they saw in 2016  Our message basically is to voters if youre going to go out and early vote if youre going to vote on Election Day use the same kinds of precautions that these health agencies are telling you to use You know frequent hand washing dont touch your face

states to start researching ideas about safe generalelection voting in November In addition to planning for more mailin ballots Biden floated a new form of voting — from your car  I think youre going to have a lot more planning for how you run an election God willing by November were able to… keep your distance and scrub down machines and have people show up and vote including drivethru voting and

2016 and suggested that now as was the case four years ago he was staying in the race too long Sanders said that in a democracy people have the right to vote He said that his team is assessing the campaign but gave no indication that he would be dropping out any time soon This line of questioning about whether he stayed in the race too long in 2016 seemed to irritate Sanders Sanders also spoke

CBP must take steps to release vulnerable and lowrisk detained persons from custody including release of individuals on recognizance bond parole or via enrollment of individuals in alternatives to detention programs Among  the senators to sign the letter were former 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Senators Elizabeth Warren Amy Klobuchar Cory Booker and Senator Bernie Sanders who is still in the race Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday called on major food delivery apps to reclassify their gig workers as employees increase their pay and set up additional safety measures for them as deliveries soar throughout the coronavirus pandemic  I am writing to request that during the novel coronavirus 2019 COVID19 pandemic you provide your front line delivery workers with the basic rights and protections they would be guaranteed if you classified them as employees rather than independent contractors she wrote to the CEOs of DoorDash Grubhub Uber Eats and Instacart   says Warren asked the companies to guarantee at least 14 days of paid sick leave to workers with symptoms of or who have been exposed to the virus as well as access to protective equipment and a pay increase for the increased risk they are taking on by continuing to work during this pandemic She wrote The coronavirus pandemic has illustrated how much your company is completely reliant on these workers to provide essential services to the public…In this public health emergency it is more important than ever to fairly compensate these workers and provide the health and safety protections they deserve A spokesperson for Grubhub said the company was not looking to reclassifying the contract workers but said it is giving two weeks of sick pay to drivers impacted by COVID19 and providing them with hand sanitizer masks and gloves  Americans in every corner of the country from homebound seniors to overwhelmed parents count on our delivery partners to access basic meals and we are doing everything we can to help them stay safe and do their jobs the spokesperson said in a statement  An Uber spokesperson said the company would respond directly to Warren but pointed to CEO Dara Khosrowshahis request that stimulus money be made available to gig workers as well as similar protective measures the company has taken for its delivery workers In a statement the spokesperson said the solution was legislation that protects gig workers not only those classified as employees  Today our laws present a forced choice between flexibility and protection We believe our laws should protect all workers not just one type of work—and rather than restricting independent work we should strengthen the protections and benefits afforded to it she said  An Instacart spokesperson said the company is offering 14 days paid sick leave to those diagnosed with COVID19 or placed in mandatory quarantine by local authorizes We welcome the conversation with Senator Warren and look forward to

respondents said theyd like to see the election moved while 44 said it should be held as scheduled   says this comes as Wisconsin faces major challenges for conducting its primary election on Tuesday due to a major shortage of poll workers and a record number of absentee ballot requests The Wisconsin Elections Commission WEC reported on Wednesday that more than 1 million people have requested absentee ballots for the election Just over 800000 people cast absentee ballots in the November 2016 general election During a court hearing Wednesday WEC Administrator Meagan Wolfe admitted that its possible some voters may not get ballots in time to vote due to possible delays in the postal system Wolfe said the US Postal Service has said that First Class mail which is how ballots are mailed usually arrives within 2 to 3 days but that it can take up to 7 days Absentee ballots can be requested until tomorrow raising questions about whether some people wont get their ballots until after election day I think its accurate to say that will occur for some Wolfe said  During closing arguments in Wednesdays hearing US District Judge William Conley indicated that its not his place to move the election date but signaled he may be open to allowing absentee ballots to be postmarked until election day or extending the window for them to be received He criticized Wisconsins governor and legislature for not taking action especially after other states have moved primary elections due to the Coronavirus pandemic and cases continue to climb in Wisconsin I dont see a basis on which I stop this albeit very risky decision by the state of Wisconsin Conley said The state of Wisconsin is ignoring that data and endangering its population According to a survey from the WEC as of Monday night 60 of jurisdictions said they were short poll workers 111 jurisdictions reported at that point that they didnt have the ability to staff even one polling site  During the court hearing Wolfe said that they have worked with those communities to find ways to recruit poll workers But if no poll workers show up at a jurisdiction there are training protocols to consolidate with a neighboring town as well as having people on standby or a pool of workers available for communities to tap into  The worker shortages have already caused a number of cities to consolidate polling locations On Tuesday Milwaukee announced that it will have less than 10 voting centers on Election Day compared to its usual 180  In a court filing a Wisconsin assistant attorney general said Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers is allowing the national guard to help staff polling sites Governor Evers has agreed to use members of the Wisconsin Army National Guard to assist as poll workers but it is anticipated that the

{"1829": " — After weathering a twoyear investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and a fivemonth long impeachment process President Trump is facing the most urgent and difficult communications challenge of his presidency with the   pandemic Politicians and strategists have been pressing him for cohesive messaging on the crisis as the public looks to the administration to figure out what actions they should be taking in response to the outbreak This is a virus that nobody knows anything about that no one has ever heard of before and people dont know how to assess the risk Alex Conant a GOP strategist who served as a White House spokesman under President George W Bush said With these highly contagious lowmortality diseases its so important to have good public communications early because thats the only way of slowing the spread But early on there were efforts by Mr Trump to downplay the coronavirus threat and at times he offered information that contradicted government scientists and doctors In his first remarks on the coronavirus in late January Mr Trump seemed unconcerned telling   we have it totally under control Its one person coming in from China On Valentines Day the president said the number infected in the US was very small Its like around 12 Many of them are getting better he said Some are fully recovered already So were in very good shape When this virus is contained there are sure to be those who think that if the Trump administration had signaled urgency earlier on the pandemic could have been contained more quickly There are now more than 60000 confirmed cases in the US and over 800 fatalities Part of the reason the virus has spread so fast is because of poor government communications around the world Conant said starting with the Chinese regime but continuing to a lot of western governments who were slow to warn their citizens The cracks in the administrations messaging strategy were evident in recent weeks Many Americans were still going to bars and restaurants and college students defied coronavirus to   even as public health officials warned of its severity  I think thats part of why you saw a ratcheting up of the rhetoric last week — because the administration recognized its messaging efforts were failing Conant said It needed to explain and convince people to embrace social distancing and give more specific guidance on terms of what employers and businesses should be doing What people need he said are facts and actionable informationthe two keys to defeating a pandemic  The administration has put a point man in place — Vice President Mike Pence is leading the White House Coronavirus Task Force Mr Trump is also using the powers of his office to deploy resources to hardest hit states Mr Trump shifted his rhetoric last week saying he views himself as a wartime president and issuing stern warnings to Americans about the need to limit their social interactions And now the president has another message too one that seems to be in conflict with selfquarantine and social distancing advice  This week he has said he   opened up and just raring to go by Easter April 12 even as other public health experts warn the   before the economy can be rebooted For now health officials in the Trump administration are still sending a message of social distancing and theyre now trying harder to reach younger Americans who have shown less concern about the virus Last week   the White Houses coronavirus response coordinator made a   to heed the guidance of public health officials and severely limit their social interactions Since then the administration has been working hard to take its message directly to this audience Dr Anthony Fauci the nations top infectious disease doctor appeared last week on Barstool Sports Pardon My Take podcast where the 79yearold who has served six presidents spoke with the podcasts colorful cohosts PFTCommenter and Big Cat On Thursday hell   on the coronavirus alongside Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry on Instagram Communicators need to go where there audiences are a White House Coronavirus Task Force official said Young audiences are brand loyal so we are seeking out those brands that are most trusted by millennials and Gen Zers   Birx has also appeared on an episode of the Skimms Skimm This podcast geared toward young women and The Morning Toast a daily morning show Surgeon General Jerome Adams was on The Bobby Bones Show a nationally syndicated country music morning show and Cheddar TV a live streaming financial news network The official said the goal of the media blitz is to educate young audiences about the virus how it can be transmitted and its effects The administration also aims to inform them about how they can slow its spread  While the disease overwhelmingly affects the elderly and those with serious underlying conditions it is critical that young Americans recognize that their actions not only impact them and their immediate peer groups but also their loved ones the task force official said   The Trump administration has also launched a campaign called 15 Days to Slow the Spread which outlines steps Americans can take to limit the spread of the coronavirus and has partnered with major media companies including ViacomCBS for PSAs to educate the public about the illness   In addition to the media outreach the White House Coronavirus Task Force has held neardaily briefings with the press which include its members and other government officials Mr Trump often appears and fields questions from reporters too though that has at times led experts like Fauci to clear up inaccurate information White House spokesman Judd Deere rebuffed criticisms about the White Houses communications strategy saying that while it might be easy to offer false commentary that is only meant to spread fear this White House has been working around the clock to protect all Americans from the coronavirus Many in the media who are now attacking the administrations response repeatedly downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak early on he said in a statement As President Trump said we are using the full power of the federal government and the private sector and he has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people Deere said the president has brought together government and private industry for unprecedented collaboration to curb the spread of the virus expand testing capacities and expedite vaccine development  The White House has also used different terms to refer to the coronavirus For awhile over several days recently Mr Trump was calling it the Chinese virus in an effort to tie the deadly illness to China where the outbreak originated And it also goes by COVID19 and has also been called the Wuhan coronavirus by officials Its not the first time theres been confusion over a global pandemic It occurred in 2009 as the Obama administration confronted the H1N1 pandemic Then the pork industry took a hit as many Americans referred to the illness as swine flu though it was not transmissible through pork In response federal agencies began referring to the flu as H1N1   But Mike McCurry former White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton said at this stage most Americans know about the coronavirus and where it originated   I dont think it matters how we call it by name he said Mr Trump seemingly agreed telling Fox News on Tuesday when asked why he stopped using the Chinese virus moniker that everyone knows it came out of China but I decided we shouldnt make more of a big deal of it The president also seemed aware that some were unfairly blaming people of Asian descent for the pandemic and he defended them during Mondays coronavirus briefing It is very important that we totally protect our AsianAmerican community in the United States and all around the world Mr Trump said Theyre amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form For McCurry one issue for the Trump administration lies with the presidents desire to serve as the lead communicator of the governments strategy   Keep the experts and scientists out there he said Keep Trump to a minimum   McCurry also cautioned for the days and weeks ahead as the administration considers its next steps in addressing the virus really smart and effective public communication strategies will be crucial   The real problem is keeping the president off the air and using him sparingly and only when necessary McCurry said I just
