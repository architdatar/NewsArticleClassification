{"8526": "As part of the federal response to the coronavirus crisis Congress approved an 83 billion emergency bill last week specifically intended to address concerns related to publichealth infrastructure No one seriously believed it would be lawmakers final word on the subject And it wasnt Late last week House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin negotiated a second package called the Families First Coronavirus Response Act with funding for free coronavirus testing enhanced unemployment insurance food assistance and limited paid leave Donald Trump endorsed the bill which passed the House just after midnight on Saturday morning Forty members   and all 40 were Republicans At that point the process got a little tricky For one thing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy gave his chamber the weekend off For another there was a glitch in the House bill which needed to be resolved before the legislation could advance Because the House is out this week the fix would need to be approved by a unanimousconsent request which Rep Louie Gohmert RTexas spent much of yesterday blocking Eventually   So problem solved Maybe     overnight that the bill is on track despite concerns among the GOP rankandfile Some Senate Republicans indicated yesterday that they intended to make significant changes to the bill which would require sending the proposal back to the House which in turn would take more time McConnell said yesterday however that he   the House bill as is Donald Trump has said hell sign it But even if we assume that the upper chamber acts relatively soon as the economy falls off a cliff these first two bills  the 83 billion package last week and the second slightly larger effort thats pending  wont be nearly enough to fill the gap Its why talks about the third phase have already begun even as the second phase is still pending The Associated Press   overnight This would likely make a significant difference and just as importantly it may be one of the few remaining federal tools available to prevent catastrophic economic circumstances The Federal Reserve has already effectively thrown everything it has at the crisis which means it will fall to Congress and the White House to keep injecting more capital into the system Buckle up"},
{"6963": "Among the problems with the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic is that the Trump administration is burdened by   The White House has struggled for several years with this  at times Donald Trump has even boasted about the empty offices  but the acute effects are now   The president raised the prospect yesterday of a dramatic White House response to the circumstances NBC News   If the House will not agree to that adjournment I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress he said during a press briefing The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony proforma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis It is a scam what they do Trump added Perhaps its never been done before Nobodys even sure if it has But were going to do it Lets clarify a few things When Trump said nobodys even sure if a president has tried to adjourn Congress thats not true we are sure that its never happened As a     noted the Republican was pointing to a constitutional power that has never been used in the history of the republic Whats more when he said he and his team are going to do it that was wrong too The explanation gets a bit technical but   had   explaining why  as a procedural matter  Trump wouldnt be able to pull off such a stunt even if he wanted to   called the very idea absurd Lets also not forget that many of Trumps nominees are ridiculous and are currently stuck in committee because Senate Republicans arent sure they can advance the presidents picks in good conscience Its probably why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy   in response to Trumps misguided threat But putting aside these relevant details theres a larger question to consider why in the world would the president float an idea like this Part of the problem is that Donald Trump has never fully familiarized himself with how the federal government works and his civic blindspots lead him to blurt out ideas he doesnt recognize as foolish But the other part of the equation is nearly as important Trump wants to appear strong and powerful unaware of the extent to which these efforts backfire when he discovers that he doesnt have the authority he wishes he had Indeed it was just this week when the president adopted a radical posture stating his belief that he has the ultimate authority over state decisions regarding the coronavirus crisis The president of the United States calls the shots Trump told reporters adding When somebody is the president of the United States the authority is total and thats the way its going to be Its total Its total And the governors know that A day later apparently having been told that his declarations were completely wrong   One day later however the president was at it again pretending hes going to adjourn Congress so that he can appoint nominees of dubious qualifications to powerful administrative posts Sometime today I suspect someone will deliver the bad news that he lacks the power to follow through on the threat Which ironically will leave Trump looking even weaker than he did before"},
{"847": "Last week Joe Bidens campaign noted that the former vice president would be willing to reach out to Donald Trump directly to discuss the federal response to the coronavirus crisis When a reporter brought this up during a White House briefing the Republican incumbent seemed quite amenable to the idea Oh absolutely the president   when asked if hed take the Democrats call Id like to speak to him Sure I always found him to be a nice guy I dont know him very well frankly but I think hes probably a nice guy No if hed like to call Id absolutely take his call Okay You could tell him For whatever reason the two did not connect in the days that followed though the possibility apparently remained on Trumps mind What ever happened to that phone call he told the Fake News he wanted to make to me he   on Twitter midmorning yesterday The two apparently spoke soon after The Associated Press   The president seemed uncharacteristically gracious when describing the 15minute conversation adding that it was really good it was really good really nice The president went on to   I appreciate his calling The two agreed not to publicly discuss the details of their chat but the Democrats campaign said that Biden shared several suggestions for actions the administration can take now to address the ongoing coronavirus pandemic At face value theres something quite remarkable about these circumstances Its one thing for a former national officeholder to exchange pleasantries with a president from the other party at an official event but its something else for a president to receive policy recommendations from a former vice president  who happens to be his principal rival in an election year This is not a political dynamic that happens often Whats more its also worth appreciating the fact that Biden has some credibility on the issue Indeed on January 27 when COVID19 was still a relatively obscure issue in the United States the Delaware Democrat wrote a     warning about an outbreak and raising the alarm about the administrations preparedness On March 12 the day before Trump declared a national emergency Biden unveiled   on how the federal response should take shape This context matters because its not enough for the president to have taken Bidens phone call its also important for Trump to consider Bidens advice Thats probably not going to happen He had suggestions the president told reporters yesterday referring to his 2020 rival It doesnt mean that I agree with those suggestions but certainly he had suggestions"},
