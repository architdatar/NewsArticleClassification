{"8326": "A debate over an executive order to boost American production of medical supplies has gripped the White House as President Trump weighs how to confront China over the   outbreak without exacerbating the economic crisis sparked by the pandemic Trump has groused about China during several recent Oval Office meetings and expressed interest in an executive order crafted by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro the president’s leading China hawk and a divisive figure within the administration The executive order would over time require the federal government to buy medical supplies and pharmaceuticals manufactured in the United States aiming to reduce dependency on imports and increase domestic production But Trump has stopped short of signing the measure Several of Trump’s confidants including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have voiced reservations about embracing’s Navarro strategy according to three officials familiar with the deliberations The unresolved debate underscores the tensions inside the West Wing as Trump publicly expresses the desire to exact compensation from China over the coronavirus but is warned privately against jeopardizing the chances of a US economic recovery or access to medical supplies from abroad all as he turns toward his reelection campaign Navarro’s draft which has circulated among senior officials for several weeks would require the federal government to only purchase essential medical equipment and pharmaceuticals manufactured in the United Statrs Navarro has argued it would make the country less dependent on foreign nations for critical medical supplies The order gives firms substantial time to figure out the new requirements reducing the shock it could have on prices and production two former officials familiar with its contents said Although it has the support of some officials at the State Department and the National Security Council Mnuchin and several business leaders close to Trump are averse to making a major push on supply chains at a fragile moment for the economy they said And Trump’s soninlaw and senior adviser Jared Kushner shares Mnuchin’s caution about Navarro’s push to do this executive order at this time two officials said and has been focused on responding to the pandemic Some White House aides privately insist the order could still be approved but others say it could be stuck in the Office of Legal Counsel under review for weeks to come since it lacks sufficient support within Trump’s inner circle Still the lag on Trump’s signature has frustrated some of Navarro’s allies inside and outside the administration Officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive internal deliberations The internal struggle over Navarro’s proposal highlights a longstanding White House rift over China that has gained new dimension and significance as the president considers his response to Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus For decades Trump has assailed his predecessors for being weak in confronting Beijing arguing the Chinese have for decades exploited clueless American politicians to ravage the US economy In White House coronavirus news conferences he has repeatedly returned to the trade deal with China reached by his administration last year “In the history of any country nobody has been ripped off like the United States by China — and many other countries And we stop it” Trump said at a White House press briefing last week “Nobody has been tougher before the deal ever on China than Trump” But confronted with a deadly global pandemic that originated in China and devastated the US economy Trump has appeared at times ambivalent in his response The president initially praised Chinese Premier Xi Jinping’s handling of the outbreak saying Xi is doing “a very good job with a very very tough situation” When the virus spread to the United States Trump resisted major swipes at Xi and instead targeted his fury at the World Health Organization Senior aides say this a way for Trump to vent and reassure his base that he is battling an organization with ties to China even if he’s not battling China and Xi daily Trump has sometimes stuck to a “waitandsee” approach suggesting China may not bear responsibility for the outbreak and ensuing damage “If it was a mistake a mistake is a mistake” Trump said last week of China and the coronavirus “But if they were knowingly responsible yeah I mean then sure there should be consequences” At other times Trump has struck a more aggressive tone On Monday the president strongly suggested the United States would seek hundreds of billions of dollars in damages from China because of the virus “We haven’t determined the final amount yet It’s very substantial” Trump said “This is worldwide damage” Inside the administration some officials are wary of an aggressive confrontation with Beijing In private discussions Mnuchin Kushner and their allies have warned that Trump could jeopardize critical protective gear for American medical workers if the White House ramps up its attacks on Xi or accedes to Navarro’s demands for remaking the US supply chain They have also urged Trump to wait to act until further investigations of China’s role are concluded officials said “Nobody except Peter wants to slam China over and over again because we’re going to need what China is making whether it’s equipment or a vaccine down the road you never know” one White House official said Navarro 70 has for decades blamed China for many of the United States’ most serious social and economic problems and feels vindicated by the outbreak according to three people he has spoken to in recent weeks Navarro warned in private memos in January about the danger posed by the coronavirus and circulated to White House advisers an “official coronavirus response plan” which included PowerPoint slides and other written materials about the potential impact of the virus one person familiar with the documents said Navarro has accused China of creating the virus and using the deadly outbreak to “profiteer” off the world’s pain Chinese officials have adamantly denied this Regardless Navarro has asserted Beijing created the virus in a government laboratory then “knowingly hid” proof of its spread He and others pushing this theory have not produced any evidence to back up their claim Alleging China committed “four kills” in its handling of the virus Navarro has said the Chinese bought the world’s supply of personal protective gear then deliberately sold those goods back to the world at inflated prices “The Chinese effectively declared war They spawned that virus” Navarro said on Fox News on Saturday In an interview Navarro said the proposed executive order was not aimed at China or any other specific country but instead intended to secure the United States’ ability to produce critical medicines supplies and equipment Navarro said he and other administration officials are focused on the current crisis of rapidly mobilizing and repurposing industrial capacity to meet US demand More than 75 other nations have imposed export restrictions on crucial medical supplies which Navarro said demonstrates “how countries realistically act in their own selfinterest to the exclusion of others when globalist push comes to nationalist shove” “This is a defensive measure for the American people not aimed at any other country” Navarro said “Onshoring America’s public health industrial base is both a national imperative and the logical conclusion to draw from a pandemic that has exposed the weak underbelly of globalized supply chains and the risks of not domestically producing your essential medicines and medical countermeasures” Navarro has in recent days circulated Pew polling data showing a sharp turn in public sentiment against China Bipartisan proposals have emerged in the Senate to require onshoring of US pharmaceutical supplies Sen Josh Hawley RMo has introduced legislation requiring firms to return production to the United States while numerous Republican senators including White House ally Sen Lindsey O Graham RSC have argued that China “needs to pay” for the pandemic and face sanctions for its role in the virus Leading Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Charles E Schumer NY have also called for Trump to act more aggressively toward China Former vice president Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee recently released an ad attacking Trump for not being sufficiently tough on China “Everybody I talk to in the Senate is thinking about how Communist China has treated America as an adversary Even the globalists even those who say we need a free economy — they look at it now and say ‘The coronavirus is the tipping point that pushed it over the edge’” Sen Rick Scott RFla said “Peter has been clear in his belief that China is an adversary and not to be trusted and the coronavirus has shown he’s been right” Navarro may prove too personally polarizing within the White House to push Trump toward confrontation Navarro’s memos on coronavirus for example were disregarded by other administration officials Administration communications officials worry about Navarro on TV and have sought in the past to keep him off the air “Peter sends a lot of memos” one official said Navarro has repeatedly clashed with top administration officials  of Anthony S Fauci the nation’s leading infectiousdisease expert  Former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn tried sidelining Navarro by assigning him to an office that “amounted to a broom closet” one former senior administration official said  Some international trade experts warn Navarro’s demands could have devastating consequences for Americans on the frontlines of responding to the pandemic arguing that foreign countries could devastate US access to supplies through retaliation Earlier this month the Trump administration faced an international backlash when it tried to impose additional controls on exports of Americanmade PPE Canada for instance manufactures a specialized tree pulp the United States imports for production of its masks The administration later added significant exemptions to its proposed restrictions “You’re exposing yourself to retaliation” said Chad Bown a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who is critical of Navarro “You’re making yourself vulnerable to being cut off from supplies from other countries It’s a huge benefit to have access to international markets to have a diverse source in a time of need” But others say the United States must try to force production back to domestic soil “The notion that an angry Chinese government would limit medicine and PPE imports on which we are incredibly reliant in retaliation for the US enacting policies to incentivize more domestic manufacturing of such supplies precisely spotlights why it’s critical to expand domestic capacity” said Lori Wallach a trade expert at Public Citizen a leftleaning organization Bob Bland founder of Masks for America which has secured hundreds of thousands of masks for nurses across the country said the United States’ dependence on China for personal protective gear has dramatically undercut its ability to protect its frontline medical personnel “Countries all over the world are realizing we don’t have the ability to make any of this locally but local production is the only way to scale up quickly enough and avoid price gouging” Bland said “The answer to that has to be regional production for PPE It would give us a fighting chance against pandemics like this in the future”"},

{"6276": "with Mariana Alfaro The vague guidelines unveiled Thursday evening by President Trump for how governors can reopen local economies do not include any implementation dates but they do say states should first have a “robust testing system in place for atrisk health care workers” Yet there remains no national testing strategy for the   only a patchwork of programs being administered with limited guidance Trump put the onus on local governments to figure it out “Were going to be helping with testing” the president said during his news conference “They’re going to be doing the testing It’s got to be a localized thing and it really has been since I’ve been involved” Diagnostic testing is important for deciding when to lift stayathome orders because it helps policymakers understand how widespread the contagion is in their communities and employers decide whether the risk is sufficiently low to bring people back to work Testing capacity has improved significantly since early stumbles but tests are still not being conducted at the levels federal officials previously said they would by now and that they thought would be necessary for easing restrictions About 33 million people have been tested in the United States according to the Covid Tracking Project but that’s only about 1 percent of the American population “ ”   “Meanwhile the American Hospital Association has raised concerns with the administration about a lack of testing supplies There also is no single administration official working on testing Deborah Birx the White House coronavirus coordinator has been communicating with hospitals and states about testing protocols while Jared Kushner the president’s soninlaw and senior adviser has been running point with industry  “The government has been unable to compel test manufacturers to dramatically increase the number of tests produced and Trump has been unwilling to invoke the Defense Production Act for that purpose States are also still struggling with acute supply shortages for tests including swabs and reagents that Washington has not addressed The lack of a federal strategy could mean jurisdictions with greater access to supplies and tests could reopen first as opposed to areas with the lowest risk …  “Trump has heralded a new rapidresponse test from Abbott Laboratories that can deliver results in as few as five minutes and has taken pride in his administration’s role helping distribute the machines nationwide But when Montana Gov Steve Bullock D said they got the ‘great Abbott machines’ two weeks ago but still don’t have testing kits required to use them Trump replied that the states are ‘going to lead the testing’ Only a fraction of the Abbott tests are being used right now because there are not enough skilled technicians around the country to operate them — a challenge officials know will continue to persist as testing ramps up” Trump also spoke on Thursday with senators “During the call the president largely held back and listened … as  ”   “Democrats in particular expressed wariness to the president about reopening the economy until the testing was robust enough … Trump predicted there are 29 states that can begin the opening soon and several that could start the process right away though he didn’t name them” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer DNY   Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that the reopening plan is “a little more measured” than he expected but that the lack of a testing plan is a problem “If we don’t have a strong adequate testing regime we’re going to have real trouble” Schumer said “The testing regime is scattershot and totally inadequate for what’s needed to get the country back to work Each state can’t come up with its own test” At least 33288 people have   in the United States from the coronavirus and at least 671000 cases have been reported   Paige Winfield Cunningham reported earlier this week in   “To screen the United States’s entire population of 330 million capacity would need to reach 22 million tests per day according to economist Paul Romer a Nobel laureate Irwin Redlener director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University said the United States should be testing between 750000 and 1 million people a week” NBC News quotes other public health experts in   that published this morning saying testing needs to be at least doubled or tripled from current levels to safely allow for even a partial reopening of Americas economy  During Thursday’s news conference she said hospitals and clinics have moved more toward pointofcare tests that do not need to be sent to labs for processing   “We have tests sitting there and equipment sitting there and now we have to really deal with each single lab to really figure out what they need” Birx explained “We’re committed to work with laboratories to answer every one of their issues with the state and local governments Frankly in every conversation I have the governors will say ‘I need 5000 people tested’ And I say ‘Well at the University of X there are 6700 tests waiting for you’ So it’s more of making sure that every governor and every public health official knows exactly where every lab is and where the tests are so we can create with them a real understanding so all these tests can be run”  While expressing support for Trump’s new guidelines during the briefing he also emphasized the importance of testing “Remember theres two types of things antibody tests and tests for the diagnosis of who has the disease One you need for contact tracing the other you need for finding out whats in society” Fauci said “Were going to have both of those much much better as we go in the next weeks and months And by the time we get into the fall I think were going to be in pretty good shape”  as well as that hospitals should be able to “treat all patients without crisis care” The guidance that was released lays out three phases for slowly easing back restriction but includes fewer details about each step than the internal report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Emergency Management Agency that    “It is the single best tool to inform decisions and to calibrate all of this” New York Gov Andrew Cuomo D said of testing at his daily briefing “This has to be figured out I understand that this is a problematic area and the federal government’s not eager to get involved in testing I get that but the plain reality here is we have to do it in partnership with the federal government” Cuomo has hired the McKinsey consulting firm to create models on testing to assist the governors in the Northeast who are working together   “The goal is to ‘Trumpproof’ the plan said an adviser to New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy”  This happened during the influenza pandemic in 1918 Fuaci emphasized that everyone from governments to civilians needs to stay flexible “Lets face it” he said “There may be some setbacks and we may have to pull back a little and then go forward” A Chicago hospital treating covid19 patients with Gilead Science’s antiviral medicine remdesivir reported seeing rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms Remdesivir is one of the first drugs identified as having the potential to impact the virus in lab tests    “In Alabama officials have ruled that one of every 10 people who died with covid19 did not die of covid19 Among those excluded from the numbers reported to the federal government were a bedbound patient with aspiration pneumonia in one lung and a person with a buildup of fluid and partial collapse of one lung”  “Colorado by contrast has included some deaths where the disease caused by the novel coronavirus was deemed probable — based on symptoms and possible exposure — but not confirmed through a test Health officials in both states say their approach is more accurate Their divergent methods reflect a national debate over how to count the dead … The CDC updated its website this week to explicitly say that cases where the infection was not confirmed by a test may now be counted But attributing a death to the virus can be a judgment call experts say and potentially a vexing one as indications emerge that the disease damages not just the lungs but also the heart kidneys and other organs As a result the overall tally — a benchmark broadcast constantly on cable news and elsewhere — is a less concrete figure than it appears The inconsistent counting methods also raise questions about the ability to draw comparisons from state to state and they play into a political debate about the reliability of the numbers” “The US surgeon general had warned that last week would be like Pearl Harbor as he attempted to create context for the threat — but it turned out that more than five times as many Americans died from covid19 last week than were killed in the World War II raid”   “In early and midMarch when America began widespread closures quarantines and social distancing covid19 caused many fewer deaths than other common causes — fewer in a week than chronic liver disease or high blood pressure and far fewer than suicide or the common flu By the end of March the toll was closer to the average weekly deaths from diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease Into April weekly covid19 deaths climbed past those from accidents and chronic lower respiratory disease And last week covid19 killed more people than normally die of cancer in this country in a week Only heart disease was likely to kill more people that week All of those comparisons include only confirmed cases … Some experts had predicted that the deaths could peak last week but this week is shaping up to be no better with new high death tolls Tuesday 2369 and Wednesday 2441 Covid19 is on pace to be the largest single killer of Americans this week given the normal number of deaths in an April week” “The employee complaints offer a snapshot of the fear experienced by the Americans compelled to work while the majority have been urged to stay at home and they arise from an array of workplaces hospitals airlines construction companies call centers grocery stores beauty

cramped work areas that prevent them from standing six feet from one another ‘The call center with over 400 people is unsanitary’ one complaint reads ‘Employees have to share desks and people are within 2 feet from each other’ ‘In the behavioral unit employees are not allowed to wear surgical masks because ‘it hurts patient’s feelings’ despite the fact that patients come in with fevers’ says

those with the capacity to process 5000 beef cattle daily — are closed because of the pandemic Absenteeism fewer employees and spreading out those remaining employees to maintain social distance are all also contributing to the slowdown National Beef Packing Co announced Monday the closure of its Tama Iowa facility And Cargill shuttered production at its Hazleton Pa ground beef and pork

{"3655": "Imagine a newscaster standing near the shore in a town where experts have issued a tsunami warning In his first report he notes sea levels are normal No cause for concern In his second report he says the sea is now a foot above normal — though that’s below where it would be at high tide a daily occurrence In his third report he assures people that while the sea is now five feet above hightide levels it’s nowhere near the levels seen in the big flood of 1936 No fourth report since the town is now underwater In each case the reports were accurate and the comparisons valid What was missed was the   Individual snapshots could be explained as something not worthy of concern But with one reading after another showing higher levels something more concerning seemed to be underway This is a hypothetical of course making it easy to massage the situation to make the reporter look as if he’s obfuscating The worry though is that this is precisely what President Trump is doing in his updates about the spread of the novel   in the United States On Monday morning Trump offered his latest assessment of the spread of the virus among tweets apparently aimed at calming plunging markets — or at least directing blame for the plunge elsewhere “So last year 37000 Americans died from the common Flu” Trump   on Twitter “It averages between 27000 and 70000 per year Nothing is shut down life  the economy go on At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths Think about that” Trump is right about the flu as   There are tens of thousands of flu deaths every year which is why authorities encourage people to get flu shots The country’s medical infrastructure can accommodate flu season even as it ramps up over the course of the winter Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   how the flu season evolves over the course of a year The number of positive flu tests surges as the illness spreads and the number of deaths related to flu or pneumonia which are   increases in correlation As flu cases drop so do deaths In a normal year about 01 percent of flu cases are fatal In years with more dangerous flu variants that number can increase The problem with Trump’s analogy is twofold The first problem is he’s ignoring the upward trend in coronavirus cases The second is he’s downplaying the deadliness of the disease Since last January he’s regularly talked about how many cases of coronavirus there are in the country In each case he offers a view of the situation akin to our hypothetical newscaster Things aren’t that bad compared with other countries or other illnesses On Jan 30 speaking during an event in Michigan Trump   “We think we have it very well under control We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five And those people are all recuperating successfully” “We think it’s going to have a very good ending for us” he added A month later in his first news conference focused on the virus he focused on 15 cases not related to passengers on a cruise ship that had been docked in Japan “When you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero” he said “that’s a pretty good job we’ve done” A couple of days later he tweeted an update on those numbers That was shortly after noon on March 5 Later in the afternoon he participated in a town hall broadcast on Fox News “It’s still 11 people versus tremendous numbers of thousands of people that have died all over the world” he said “We have 11 We have 149 cases as of this moment” See that increase From 129 to 149 in a few hours And again this was last Thursday Remember that on Monday morning he was waving away 546 cases — a 266 percent increase It’s snapshot after snapshot of coronavirus numbers contextualized in a way that the effects seem more limited The trend though looks like this That graph which includes only reported cases through the morning of March 9 indicates we’re on the upswing Trump is comparing the current situation to the   of the flu season — but we don’t know where the peak of the coronavirus spread will be Maybe it will be 600 cases It’s far more likely it will be in the thousands or tens of thousands Notice too how Trump’s own numbers undercut his arguments about the mortality rate of the illness Speaking to Fox News’s Sean Hannity last week Trump said he didn’t accept the World Health Organization’s estimate that 34 percent of coronavirus cases would be fatal “This is just my hunch” he   “but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this Because a lot of people will have this and it’s very mild They’ll get better very rapidly They don’t even see a doctor They don’t even call a doctor You never hear about those people So you can’t put that down in the category in the overall population in terms of this coronaflu or virus” In his tweet on Thursday though Trump compared 3280 deaths from 100000 cases internationally — 33 percent mortality rate — to 129 cases in the United States with 11 fatalities That’s an 85 percent mortality rate significantly   than what the WHO estimated His numbers on Monday were better yielding a 4 percent mortality rate Still his hunch isn’t supported by the data One of two things is true Either the disease is much more deadly in the United States which isn’t likely or the number of cases is much larger than what has been recorded That’s likely given the slow rollout of tests across the country But Trump would rather have low numbers to reassure the public — and to convince them he has it “very well under control” as he said in January Hence   on Friday that he was less worried about treating the passengers on a cruise ship anchored near San Francisco than he was about keeping the number of recorded cases down The lesson from our tsunami newscaster is not that the flooding of the town was necessarily historic Maybe it was just a bad flood nothing exceptional in nature It’s that presenting the rising sea levels only as snapshots relative to the worst case doesn’t accurately convey the threat The coronavirus epidemic may be historic and may end up being as pervasive as the flu straining or breaking the country’s ability to handle the existing cases If you read Trump’s Twitter feed or listen to his public comments though you wouldn’t understand that risk Which is the point"},

minutes later he said he probably would get tested Hours after that however the White House emailed out a statement from Trump’s physician that said the president was fine and did not need a test But on Saturday Trump said he was tested Friday night apparently as a precaution and he told reporters his body temperature was “totally normal” Hours later the White House physician announced Trump tested negative for the virus Trump’s announcement and test results capped days of evasiveness by the White House and Trump’s own refusal to submit to the same   his administration is asking the rest of the nation to adopt to slow the spread of the pandemic His reluctance to get tested also fed into criticism that Trump was not taking the   enough even as he praised the job he and his administration have done “The results are very very good and when you compare this with what is happening around the world we are very proud of our people” he said Saturday Trump’s testing announcement appeared to catch some aides off guard including Vice President Pence especially given that the president’s physician released a memo hours earlier stating that the risk for Trump was “low” The abrupt pivot came as the White House appeared to be enacting new screening measures announcing that anyone in proximity to Trump or Pence would have their temperatures taken White House correspondents were screened ahead of the briefing and one was turned away after aides said the journalist had a fever reading of above 1004 degrees on three successive measurements from a noncontact thermometer Whether the moves were taken to demonstrate additional seriousness in the face of the global pandemic or over fears for Trump’s health they came after weeks in which the president sought to play down the risks and touted the nation’s relatively low although quickly growing number of confirmed cases and deaths Experts said they expect the cases to grow exponentially even as the administration has implemented new travel restrictions and other measures In recent weeks as cities and states began banning large gatherings airlines and cruises were grounded professional sports leagues canceled their seasons and schools shut down Trump appeared determined to carry on with business as usual in an apparent effort to bolster public confidence He has continued to shake hands with supporters and aides met with more than 1000 donors at his private MaraLago resort the previous weekend and has interacted with several congressmen who later selfquarantined as well as the Brazilian delegation that has multiple officials who have tested positive for coronavirus Experts have called Trump’s behavior a risky and irresponsible example for a nation in the midst of a burgeoning health crisis and amid the exhortations of medical experts that all Americans should practice social distancing to help slow the spread of the virus Asked Saturday if his shift to more prudent personal conduct aimed to demonstrate greater urgency Trump insisted that “this was urgent for me right from the beginning” citing his early decision to ban travel from China where the illness originated He said he agreed it would be wise not to shake hands and that he had long viewed the practice as unsanitary but he explained that it was difficult for him to break the habit since becoming president “Political people they walk up to me and want to shake my hand” Trump said “It’s sort of a natural reflex We’re all getting out of it All of us have that problem” The president spent the previous weekend at his private resort in Palm Beach Fla that was teeming with an eclectic mix of visitors donors attending the annual Republican National Committee retreat a delegation led by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and family and friends celebrating the birthday of Kimberly Guilfoyle the former Fox News host who is dating Donald Trump Jr Among the guests were Rudolph W Giuliani the president’s personal lawyer as well as Sen Lindsey O Graham RSC and Rep Matt Gaetz RFla who both selfquarantined last week — Gaetz after flying home to Washington with Trump aboard Air Force One “It was louder and wilder than usual” said one person who was there and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private scene Graham said there were up to 500 people at the birthday celebration alone “It’s hard to tell who you’ve met and who you didn’t” he said in an interview as guests assess their potential exposure risk after the fact Trump arrived on March 6 after spending the day touring tornadodamaged sections of Nashville and visiting the Centers for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta for a coronavirus update At his resort that evening Trump told the donors that “nobody is blaming us” for the virus according to an account from another guest who asked for anonymity to quote the president’s private remarks Despite big drops in the stock markets the president seemed eager to spin the potential upside — that the closing of borders around the world would promote his “America First” agenda “Certain industries are going to be hit very hard — cruise ships and airlines and certain industries” the president said according to the guest “But at the same time I’ve been saying for a long time people should stay in our country and travel in our country and that’s going to happen” Observers said Trump appeared to be in a good mood and exhibited no personal concerns about the virus despite the large number of people in the facility Since the weekend however at least four people who were at the resort have tested positive for the coronavirus That includes three Brazilians who interacted with Trump — Bolsonaro’s communications secretary Fabio Wajngarten who took a photo with him and two who attended the dinner including acting Brazilian ambassador Nestor Forster Jr RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel who led the donors conference at the resort confirmed to The Washington Post on Saturday that she has been tested for the virus and is awaiting the results while in selfquarantine in Michigan after exhibiting flulike symptoms To national security experts the scene at MaraLago raised flags about the ad hoc nature of Trump’s interactions at his private venues and the relatively unregulated access that guests have to him “That’s how Trump does business among friends and he considers Bolsonaro and his delegation as a group of friends” said Fernando Cutz who served as Western Hemisphere director at the National Security Council before leaving in 2018 “Bolsonaro’s son was there Trump likes that He feels connected to the thought of the children of the president being involved That plays a role in it He was acting in a very unguarded friendly MaraLagotype way” In a photo posted to Wajngarten’s social media Trump and Pence are seen posing with the Bolsonaro aide and a Brazilian businessman with the president clutching a “Make Brazil Great Again” hat Wajngarten initially dismissed Brazilian news reports that he tested positive but the government acknowledged that he had Bolsonaro’s office said the Brazilian president tested negative “There was somebody who they say has it I have no idea who he is” Trump said at a White House news conference Friday “I haven’t seen the pictures I take hundreds of pictures a day That night I was taking hundreds of pictures so I don’t know” Brazilian officials and other guests said the White House asked basic screening questions of at least some who were in proximity to the president including where they had traveled recently and whether they felt ill But it does not appear that guests had their temperatures taken Experts have said that those infected with coronavirus can be asymptomatic and still pass the illness to others After the dinner some in the Brazilian delegation joined Trump and other US officials at Guilfoyle’s birthday party Trump offered a toast to the group for their “energy” Ivanka Trump and Kushner also gave toasts according to one of the people who was at the resort and Graham gave a speech lauding Guilfoyle for being the political opposite of liberal Sen Bernie Sanders IVt In all Trump attended at least four fundraisers throughout the weekend said a person familiar with his schedule and he introduced some donors to Bolsonaro On Friday Trump’s campaign sent an email to donors alerting them that more than one guest had tested positive for coronavirus and urging them to consult doctors if they show symptoms The day after the dinner with Bolsonaro Trump again addressed the GOP donors “We’ve done good” he said of the administration’s coronavirus response according to the guest who relayed his remarks to The Post “But no matter what we do it will never be good for the press Because they’re using this to try and win an election” The president did not yet know that the virus had penetrated the confines of his oceanfront resort as he continued “They’re trying to scare everybody from meetings cancel the meetings close the schools — you know destroy the country And that’s ok as long as we can win the election But I really believe that if they see that the Trump administration is handling this virus in a professional competent way I don’t believe that’s going to hurt us” MaraLago will likely be hosting fewer events as efforts to thwart the spread of the virus ramp up The Republican Party of Palm Beach County was scheduled to have its annual Lincoln Day Dinner at the club on Friday but had to postpone it They have held it there the past couple of years and last year 700 people attended “In light of the national emergency and also concern of folks who don’t want to be around large crowds we decided to postpone it” said Michael Barnett chairman of the county party “We’re going to schedule it for sometime in late April or May” It will still be at MaraLago he said “We wouldn’t want to have it anywhere else”"},

For those who have a positive test but are asymptomatic the public health agency as of Friday recommended quarantining 10 days from the testing date”  But the agency acknowledges a “limited” number of people who become severely ill may need to isolate longer as they may continue to produce the virus for longer  According to the data only a small fraction of people across the United States had coronavirus antibodies “The new CDC information was derived from blood samples drawn from more than 16000 people in 10 geographic regions from New York to Washington state and Utah to Minnesota”   “The samples collected in discrete periods from late March to midMay during routine screenings such as cholesterol tests were scrutinized for antibodies which indicate whether the immune system has mounted a response to the virus”  What’s more the CDC data found the number of coronavirus infections is probably 10 times the number of reported cases There could be 38 million infections the CDC says instead of the reported 38 million  Laurie adds “The latest results showed that low proportions of people have antibodies to the virus even in hardhit areas The percentage ranged from 1 percent in the San Francisco Bay area in late April to 69 percent in New York in late March The proportions may be higher now in some areas because of the recent surge in infections”  The report was released by Resolve to Save Lives a New York nonprofit led by former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden It found states which have largely come up with their own approaches for tracking and controlling the coronavirus in the absence of a national approach are reporting inconsistent and incomplete data  “Some essential information that would show response effectiveness is not being reported at all Only two states report data on how quickly contact tracers were able to interview people who test positive to learn about potential contacts” she reports “Not a single state reports on the turnaround time of diagnostic tests the analysis found Weeklong waits for results hobble efforts to track realtime virus spread and make contact tracing almost irrelevant”  In a news briefing Frieden lauded states for doing “the challenging hard meticulous job of collecting analyzing and presenting crucial information” He added “But because of the lack of national leadership we don’t have common standards definitions targets or accountability”  The former CDC chief is pointing to 15 data points that he and other public health leaders say are critical for the pandemic response The data points include information such as confirmed and probable cases and hospitalization rates per capita Notably the rift comes as a deadline nears on expiring emergency relief  The Senate Republican and White House positions changed numerous times yesterday Some GOP lawmakers refused to back Trump’s push for a payroll tax cut Others pushed to convince the White House to support more funding for the CDC and for coronavirus testing    “Complicating matters other Republican lawmakers appeared mortified about the growing size of the spending bill leading to bickering over which policies to remove and warning that miscalculations could allow Democrats to seize control of the White House and the Senate in November” they report “The whole process now appears likely to spill into August something the White House and congressional Democrats had hoped to avoid because it would mean more than 20 million Americans would lose emergency unemployment benefits when they expire at the end of this month They have not mapped out a plan for what would happen to these people as the pandemic’s turmoil continues to weigh on the US economy”  “What in the hell are we doing” Sen Ted Cruz RTex reportedly asked his colleagues at yesterday’s lunch with White House officials a remark that came amid frustration at the push to boost spending levels   The findings detailed in a 92page inspection report from the Pennsylvania Department of Health don’t specifically refer to hydroxychloroquine the controversial antimalaria drug but it notes “serious breakdowns in patient care and safety before during and after doctors at the home began to prescribe hydroxychloroquine in April”   “Nursing home administrators had no plans in place to manage sick patients conduct contact tracing and investigations or protect residents from ‘crosscontamination infection viruses and disease’ according to the June inspection”  State regulators say the conditions put 128 of 154 residents at the nursing facility for veterans in immediate jeopardy  “The findings largely confirm allegations by nurses aides and the relatives of residents who for weeks have said the center made little effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus and ultimately turned to hydroxychloroquine” Debbie and Shawn report The Washington Post reported earlier this month that residents at the facility received a drug regimen that included hydroxychloroquine and that nurses and aides called the “covid cocktail” The antimalaria drug was given to at least 11 people who hadn’t been tested for the virus  They add “It is not known whether the drug caused or contributed to any deaths at the home which has attributed 42 fatalities to covid19”  Here are a few more stories to catch up on this morning "},
{"3710": "With the House poised to give final passage to a 484 billion package of new pandemic relief funds on Thursday lawmakers and the Trump administration are already turning their focus on the next round of stimulus for the stalled US economy The legislation that the House will take up which passed the Senate Tuesday includes 320 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program designed to help struggling small businesses keep their workers on the payroll It’s widely regarded as an interim step as the coronavirus pandemic continues to cause death and economic havoc “We’re ready to go on to the next bill” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday morning on MSNBC Both parties are looking at followup legislation that would be more comprehensive and costly President Donald Trump who met Tuesday with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said aid to state and local governments would be part of a socalled phase four stimulus as would money for road projects and expanding broadband service “Infrastructure is going to be a big part” Trump said at a White House briefing “We have to rebuild our country” At the same briefing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined to put a price tag on the next package but Cuomo and other governors have called on the federal government to provide at least 500 billion into state aid alone The 484 billion legislation moving through Congress this week comes on top of the 2 trillion package enacted last month and follows tens of billions of dollars in earlier measures passed in response to the pandemic While the dollar figure so far is historic so is the scale of the downturn with some economists expecting doubledigit contraction in gross domestic product in the second quarter Capital Economics forecasts an unprecedented 40 annualized drop in that period The unemployment rate is likely around 17 already  the highest since the Depression era of the 1930s  based on the roughly 22 million jobless claims filed during the coronavirus epidemic so far that wiped out a decade of labor market gains “More is still needed Almost definitely this is not going to be a 1 2 3 bill thing just as this pandemic isn’t going to be a couple of months thing” said Troy Ludtka an economist at Natixis Lawmakers and the administration need to “just keep throwing money at the problem” he said While putting more stimulus into the economy has bipartisan support and the backing of Trump the spending is sending the US further into debt This year’s deficit is on track to hit almost 4 trillion about 18 of the total economy The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget forecasts that the nation’s debt will rise to levels not seen since the country emerged from World War II Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Congress should take “measured steps” with additional rescue measures “Let’s weigh this very carefully because the future of our country in terms of the amount of debt that we’re adding up is a matter of genuine concern” the Kentucky Republican said Democrats want a broad spending package for the next round Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said it should include funds for state and local governments hazard pay for frontline workers food aid election security and funds for the US Postal Service More money is needed “to help our heroes our health care workers our firefighters our first responders EMS our folks who are doing all the wonderful work to save lives as they risk their lives” Pelosi said “Now they may lose their jobs” Pelosi emphasized that the latest bill sets aside billions for smaller businesses many of which didn’t receive money in the program’s first round She said it was a “very sad thing” that some larger companies with annual revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars instead received the federal aid “Congress will be watching you can be sure” she said It’s not clear how quickly a plan with bipartisan support can be drafted Congress isn’t scheduled to return to Washington until May 4 though negotiations can take place and provisions drafted without most lawmakers in town The Senate approved the latest measure in an almost empty chamber with almost every senator back in their home states after signaling to party leaders they had no objection to passing the legislation The House plans to return to Washington Thursday for a formal vote The latest package would provide 320 billion to allow the PPP to take new applicants for the program which provides forgivable loans to small business that keep employees on the payroll for eight weeks It sets aside 30 billion of the PPP loan funds for banks and credit unions with 10 billion to 50 billion in assets and another 30 billion for even smaller institutions Democrats pushed for that arguing such institutions could better serve “underbanked” small business like those owned by newer businesses or those owned by women and minorities The measure includes 60 billion in loans and grants for a separate Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and makes farms and ranches eligible for the loans Also there is 75 billion for hospitals with a significant portion aimed at those in rural areas and 25 billion for virus testing Funds for Testing The testing funds include 18 billion for states localities territories and tribes to conduct Covid19 tests 1 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 18 billion for the National Institutes of Health As much as 1 billion would cover costs of testing for the uninsured The drafting of the legislation was punctuated by delays and partisan wrangling in negotiations with Schumer and Pelosi on one side and Mnuchin and McConnell on the other McConnell and Schumer on Tuesday traded blame for passage not coming until after the small business aid program ran out of its original allocation of money“It’s unfortunate that it took our Democratic colleagues 12 days to agree to a deal that contains essentially nothing that Republicans ever opposed” McConnell said “The American people cannot be political leverage” McConnell’s original proposal to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program didn’t include any of the other provisions that were ultimately included in the legislation including aid for hospitals and money to bolster testing for the coronavirus Democrats also sought and won measures aimed at ensuring that businesses without relationships with major banks can get access to Small Business Administration assistance “The hard work of negotiation paid off” Schumer said “This legislation is significantly better” than the original offered by Republicans because it includes an addition 220 billion for small businesses health care providers and a “down payment” on a national testing program he said For more articles
