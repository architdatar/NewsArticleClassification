{"4265": "With more than a   and   the hunger for good news was so strong on Wednesday that reports that a possible treatment for the coronavirus showed early signs of promise helped   The early results of a federal trial showing that treatment with remdesivir an experimental antiviral drug can speed recovery in infected patients were heralded as “very optimistic” at the White House by Dr Anthony S Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases That helped the SP 500   on a day the Commerce Department reported   in the nation’s gross domestic product since 2008 during the Great Recession President Trump and his advisers similarly embraced optimism as a theme in a week when the nation surpassed   from the virus As   the White House has continued to offer a   in which the actions of Mr Trump and his team were not belated and inadequate but bold and effective “The federal government rose to the challenge and this is a great success story” Jared Kushner the president’s soninlaw   “And I think that that’s really you know what needs to be told”  At a televised meeting at the White House with business leaders on Wednesday afternoon the president went further talking of seeing “the light at the end of the tunnel very strongly” He waxed at length about restoring life to the United States as if the crisis were nearly over He disclosed that he planned to fly to Arizona next week and soon after that to Ohio He talked wistfully of going to football games and resuming his campaign rallies “I’d like to get out” he said The strong desire to let businesses reopen has been complicated by the nation’s inability to conduct the amount of testing that public health officials say will be needed to identify trace and contain new outbreaks as social distancing rules are eased Earlier on Wednesday Mr Trump joined Dr Fauci in hailing the early results of the federal trial of remdesivir holding out hope that the drug could help very ill patients recover more quickly “It is a very important proof of concept because what it has proved is that a drug can block this virus” Dr Fauci said “This is very optimistic” Dr Fauci cautioned that the results of the study still needed to be properly peer reviewed President Trump wants a crash program to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus an undertaking viewed with some skepticism even inside the administration The idea would be to accelerate the process to create test and massproduce a vaccine — which doctors have repeatedly said would take a minimum of a year to 18 months — so that hundreds of millions of doses could be ready by the end of the year Public health experts have warned that rushing the process could undermine the treatment’s effectiveness and even lead to sickness or death The White House has made no public announcement of the effort which is known internally as “Operation Warp Speed” Some officials are apparently trying to talk the president out of moving too quickly warning about the risks that would come with setting an unrealistic deadline But after the effort was   the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed its existence “Operation Warp Speed is clearly another extension of President Trump’s bold leadership and unwillingness to accept ‘business as usual’ approaches to addressing the Covid19 crisis” said   the Trump loyalist recently hired as the department’s new assistant secretary for public affairs After hearing from Dr Anthony S Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and other experts on the coronavirus task force that even a year to 18 months might be an ambitious timetable to have a vaccine ready for mass use Mr Trump ordered the health and human services secretary Alex M Azar II to come up with a faster program According to one administration official the idea would be to indemnify the major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies from liability if the vaccines incite sickness or death and to involve the Pentagon in the testing program But most of the military’s efforts have focused on defenses against biological weapons not viruses that arise naturally or are transmitted by community spread Mayor Eric M Garcetti of Los Angeles   that any city and county residents who want a virus test can get one whether or not they are showing symptoms Priority will still be given to health care employees other workers who interact with the public and people with symptoms but asymptomatic residents will also be able to get a test Mr Garcetti said that in doing so Los Angeles would be the “first major city in America” to offer free coronavirus testing to all residents He said residents of Los Angeles County were included in the move “So if you think you might have Covid19 want the reassurance that you don’t or you’ve been around people that you have seen with symptoms get a test” the mayor said “We can do it” On Wednesday night   to which Mr Garcetti directed Angelenos to schedule a test said there were “no appointments available” for people who were not experiencing flulike symptoms “We’re sorry but testing appointments are full at this time” the website said when a user indicated that he or she had no symptoms “Please check back for updates” Gov Gavin Newsom had   how the state may gradually reopen and Mr Garcetti said getting tested was a “really important step to prepare for other steps forward” It is unclear how many people will sign up to be tested or how long they will have to wait Just over 6 million people have been tested in the United States including about 603000 in California according to   More than 10 million people live in Los Angeles County according to the Census Bureau In response to a reporter’s question about how the city would manage to test so many people Mr Garcetti said the city had tests left over each day and was confident in its ability to test any resident who wanted it including those who want to get tested multiple times over the course of several weeks or months Mr Garcetti said the testing would be carried out at 34 testing sites in the city that have the capacity to test at least 18000 people each day At least 140000 people have been tested at those sites in the past month he said About 22485 people in Los Angeles County   and the death toll there has risen to 1056 Gov Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Wednesday that the state would take a “small deliberate methodical” approach to reopening The first phase which will begin on Monday will allow restaurants and stores to operate at 25 percent capacity Outdoor seating at restaurants will be allowed with social distancing Movie theaters will remain closed as will bars gyms and personal services like hairdressers “We want to build as much confidence as possible with the general public” Mr DeSantis a Republican said at a news conference “Fear is our enemy” For now the reopening will exclude MiamiDade Broward and Palm Beach Counties the state’s most populous which have had a majority of cases The Florida Keys will also remain closed to nonresidents Mr DeSantis said he was confident that southeast Florida would be able to follow the rest of the state soon but provided few other details as to how he would enforce the reopening phases or prevent residents from traveling among counties  Florida has   As of Wednesday evening at least 1216 people had died The governor who met with President Trump in Washington on Tuesday said the White House gave the state the green light to begin lifting restrictions “I spoke with the president’s team” Mr DeSantis said “They agreed that Florida is ready to go to Phase One” Republican lawmakers in Louisiana are pushing back against the governor’s decision to extend the statewide stayathome order until May 15 and are considering using their legislative authority to find a way to override it The extension prompted an immediate backlash from Republicans with some lawmakers weighing a petition that would officially challenge the governor’s order   on Wednesday “We’re working on every possible solution to safely open our economy as quickly as possible and get our families back to work” Clay Schexnayder the Republican speaker of the State House of Representatives said in a statement “One of the ideas is to override the governor’s emergency declaration” As other states in the South have moved forward with plans to ease restrictions Gov John Bel Edwards a Democrat said that Louisiana which was among the states hardest hit by the virus was not ready to take that step He met with President Trump on Wednesday and discussed efforts to ramp up testing and create a road map for reopening the state’s economy  The governor’s supporters have argued that overriding his order would interrupt the flow of federal emergency funds and interfere with other executive commands like the closure of schools Still Republicans argued that Mr Edwards’s decision would choke an already weakened economy and that more relaxed measures would cause less damage to the economy while being sufficient in fighting the virus Critics of the governor are arguing for an alternative set of restrictions imposed on more targeted areas that are considered hot spots for the virus “This onesizefitsall lockdown is not sustainable” Sharon Hewitt a Republican state senator   On Wednesday   that leaders of West Feliciana Parish said they were planning to allow the reopening of restaurants libraries museums and houses of worship with social distancing restrictions in place President Trump’s declaration on Tuesday that meatpacking plants were “critical infrastructure” that should be kept open during the pandemic sent a powerful signal that protecting the nation’s food supply was a federal priority But exactly   even in the middle of outbreaks that have sickened thousands of workers and turned the facilities into hot spots was unclear “This is more symbolism than substance” said Steve Vladeck a law professor at the University of Texas “He’s opening the door for the executive branch to take some far more specific actions visàvis the meat plants but the order itself doesn’t do anything” While the order does not explicitly mandate that plants stay open it could allow the Agriculture Department to potentially force meat companies to fulfill orders from retailers effectively keeping them open in some capacity Lobbyists for the meat industry said the executive order which allowed for the Defense Production Act to be invoked and could shield companies from lawsuits was significant because it created federal guidelines for the steps plants needed to take to prevent the virus from spreading “This order tells them they need to stay open and they get cover” Howard Roth the president of the National Pork Producers Council said on a conference call on Wednesday Still the order does not address some critical questions such as whether the plants should test all their workers for the virus before reopening  The   the US economic growth streak The questions now are how extensive the damage will be — and how long the country will take to recover US gross domestic product the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy fell at a 48 percent annual rate in the first quarter of the year the Commerce Department said on Wednesday That is the first decline since 2014 and the worst quarterly contraction since 2008 when the country was in a deep recession  Widespread layoffs and business closings did not happen until late March or the very end of the last quarter in most of the country Economists expect figures from the current quarter which will capture the effects of the shutdown more fully to show that GDP contracted at an annual rate of 30 percent or more  “They’re going to be the worst in our lifetime” Dan North the chief economist for the credit insurance company Euler Hermes North America said of the secondquarter figures “They’re going to be the worst in the postWorld War II era” The larger question is what happens afterward Steven Mnuchin the Treasury secretary said this week that he expected the economy to “ ” this summer as states lift stayathome orders and trillions of dollars in federal emergency spending reach businesses and households Most independent economists are much less optimistic The Congressional Budget Office last week released   indicating that the economy would begin growing again in the second half of the year but that the GDP would not return to its prepandemic level until 2022 at the earliest The Federal Reserve pledged on Wednesday to do what it could to insulate the economy as lockdowns took a severe toll on economic growth The central bank said it would keep interest rates near zero until a recovery was well underway The first female federal prisoner to die after contracting the coronavirus was a 30yearold mother who had just weeks earlier given birth while on a ventilator The woman Andrea Circle Bear of Eagle Butte SD was sentenced in January to serve 26 months in prison for using a residence on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation to sell drugs in 2018 On March 20 Ms Circle Bear was transferred from a jail in Winner SD to Federal Medical Center Carswell a prison that holds about 1625 female prisoners in Fort Worth She was immediately placed into quarantine the federal Bureau of Prisons   in line with the agency’s new policy to reduce the risk of inmates contracting the virus from a new arrival Because of concerns about her pregnancy Ms Circle Bear was admitted to a hospital about a week later on March 28 but she was sent back to the prison later that day Three days later Ms Circle Bear developed a fever a dry cough and more possible coronavirus symptoms and was taken back to the hospital where she was placed on a ventilator a   on her own The next day on April 1 her baby was born by cesarean section The judge who sentenced Ms Circle Bear had said in court documents that her baby was due in early May On April 4 three days after her baby’s birth Ms Circle Bear’s coronavirus test came back positive She died on Tuesday more than three weeks later “Not every prison death is avoidable but Andrea Circle Bear’s certainly seems to have been — she simply should not have been in a federal prison under these circumstances” Kevin Ring president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums said in a statement “Her death is a national disgrace and I hope it is a wakeup call” The virus has ravaged prisons across the United States and eight of the nation’s 10 largest coronavirus clusters were in prisons or jails as of Wednesday evening   of cases Vice President Mike Pence defended his decision not to wear a face mask while touring a building at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota on Tuesday saying he was regularly tested for the virus and was following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines even if he was violating the clinic’s policy  the head of the coronavirus task force former Mayo Clinic patients and their family members pointed to the institution they had long held in high esteem for permitting the vice president to flout the rules Kenneth Rinzler a lawyer who had openheart surgery at the clinic in 2010 wrote in a letter to the president of the institution that he was “beyond shocked” to see Mr Pence in the building without a mask “and violating every basic tenet of social distancing”  Susie Watson the wife of a former bone marrow transplant patient at the clinic was equally alarmed and wrote to the clinic asking why its administrators did not insist that Mr Pence wear a mask  “It really makes us wonder about your judgment” she wrote in an email that she shared with The Times “Wearing a mask should not be voluntary at Mayo This is seriously upsetting not to mention a huge public relations mistake for all the nation to see” A spokeswoman for the vice president did not respond on Wednesday to a request for comment Mr Pence defended his decision on Tuesday As schools across the country consider   and what that could look like the American Federation of Teachers one of two national teachers’ unions outlined the conditions that it expected to be met before schools reopen The vision is more cautious than the one expressed in recent days by the president who on Monday   that they should “maybe get going on it” Randi Weingarten the union’s president said the plan offered “a stark contrast to the conflicting guidance bluster and lies of the Trump administration” The union is asking for school buildings to remain closed until local cases have declined for 14 consecutive days with adequate testing It says that when schools open they should be prepared to screen for fevers set up handwashing stations at entry points place individuals with suspected cases in isolation rooms and provide staff members with protective equipment The plan floats the possibility of voluntary summer programs smaller class sizes of 12 to 15 students and schedules of partial days or weeks to maintain social distancing with afterschool programs for families that need more hours of child care After a revered Hasidic rabbi died of the virus in Brooklyn on Tuesday his fellow congregants informed the Police Department that they would hold a public funeral despite virus restrictions The local police precinct did not stand in their way a testament to the Hasidic community’s influence in the Williamsburg neighborhood But by 730 pm an estimated 2500 ultraOrthodox Jewish men had arrived to mourn Rabbi Chaim Mertz packing together shouldertoshoulder on the street and on the steps of brownstones violating social distancing guidelines and turning the funeral into one of most fraught events of the virus crisis for Mayor Bill de Blasio Police began to disperse the mourners and the mayor   at “the Jewish community and all communities” saying he had instructed the Police Department “to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups” Mr de Blasio spent much of Wednesday on the defensive over his handling of the funeral and his use of the phrase “Jewish community” in his public criticism of the mourners  “People’s lives were in danger before my eyes and I was not going to tolerate it” he told reporters “I regret if the way I said it in any way gave people a feeling of being treated the wrong way that was not my intention It was said with love but it was tough love” The challenge of monitoring gatherings may become even more daunting as the weather gets warmer and more New Yorkers are tempted to leave their homes for the first time in weeks — even as the pandemic appears to have no clear end in sight At his daily briefing Gov Andrew M Cuomo of New York said that 330 more people in the state had died He also said the number of virus patients newly admitted to hospitals had risen slightly for the first time in 12 days The acting secretary of the Navy on Wednesday   into the events aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt apparently shelving for now a recommendation by the Navy’s top admiral to restore Capt Brett E Crozier to command the virusstricken warship “I have unanswered questions that the preliminary inquiry has identified and that can only be answered by a deeper review” the acting secretary James E McPherson said in a statement Mr McPherson said he was directing the chief of naval operations Adm Michael M Gilday to conduct a followup investigation expanding a preliminary review that the Navy completed and presented last week to Defense Secretary Mark T Esper Mr McPherson’s announcement came days after Admiral Gilday recommended reinstating Captain Crozier But Mr Esper who initially said he would leave the process largely in the hands of the military chain of command delayed endorsing the findings until he said he could review the Navy’s investigation Deaths have been mounting at a nursing home for veterans in western Massachusetts where at least 68 residents have died after contracting the virus making it one of the deadliest nursing home outbreaks in the country To date 82 residents and 81 employees of the facility have tested positive Employees at the 247bed statemanaged Holyoke Soldiers’ Home have described the facility as unprepared for the wave of cases that emerged in March They said infected patients were left on crowded wards exposing dozens of vulnerable veterans Lethal outbreaks of the virus have ravaged nursing homes across the nation The virus is known to be more deadly to aging immunecompromised people small confined settings like nursing homes where workers frequently move from one room to the next are particularly vulnerable to spreading infection The outbreak in Holyoke became public at the end of March after Alex Morse the mayor received an anonymous letter from a staff member describing “horrific circumstances” Within days the facility’s superintendent had been placed on administrative leave and the National Guard was deployed to assist with testing Since then because military honors are unavailable flags in the state have been lowered to halfstaff in memory of veterans lost in Holyoke and at a soldiers’ home in  A group of prominent independent restaurant owners is asking Congress for a 120 billion stabilization fund to prevent thousands of restaurants across the country from closing after huge and protracted losses stemming from the pandemic “We are fighting to give restaurants a fighting chance” said José Andrés a Washingtonbased chef and philanthropist who has been at the forefront of lobbying for his industry which has accounted for about 60 percent of all American job losses in March according to the   The group formed after a vast majority of independent operators were   to take part in a federal program to aid small businesses Under that program businesses   if their employees are paid over the eightweek period after the loan is made But that is difficult for bars and restaurants many of which were ordered to close Once reopened many restaurants will be unable to comply with socialdistancing rules and run at full capacity “How do I make money if I have to bring back all my staff doing less volume and less sales” Nina Compton the owner of Compère Lapin in New Orleans said during a conference call on Wednesday “We need support we need stabilization” Speaker Nancy Pelosi named six House Democrats on Wednesday to sit on a newly created select committee that will scrutinize the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic Among them are three senior Democrats who lead House committees Representative Maxine Waters of California the chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee Representative Carolyn B Maloney of New York the chairwoman of the Oversight and Reform Committee and Representative Nydia M Velázquez of New York the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee Ms Pelosi also selected three more junior members based on their areas of expertise Representative Bill Foster Democrat of Illinois is a former scientist Representative Andy Kim of New Jersey is a former National Security Council staff member with extensive national security experience And Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland was a constitutional law professor before joining the House “We must make sure that the historic investment of taxpayer dollars made in the CARES Act is being used wisely and efficiently to help those in need not be exploited by profiteers and pricegougers” Ms Pelosi said in a statement referring to the 22 trillion stimulus measure The speaker had already announced that she would place Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina the thirdranking Democrat and one of her top deputies at the helm of the panel It is expected to begin working in the weeks to come and it will be given wide leeway to scrutinize all aspects of the federal response including the fulfillment of the stimulus and the Trump administration’s struggle to ramp up virus testing Five slots on the committee are reserved for Republicans who have yet to name their members Jared Kushner the president’s soninlaw and senior adviser who has been   to hardhit states declared the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic a great success despite withering criticism that it was slow to see the threat and respond to it “We’re on the other side of the medical aspect of this and I think that we’ve achieved all the different milestones that are needed”   on Wednesday morning “The federal government rose to the challenge and this is a great success story And I think that that’s really you know what needs to be told” Mr Kushner rejected the concerns of governors and public health experts who said that testing remained woefully inadequate to justify reopening the country after weeks of lockdown While Mr Trump’s administration committed this week to helping states be able to test at least 2 percent of their populations each month experts said that is a fraction of what is needed to map out how far the virus has spread “We’ve done more tests than any other country in the world so we’ve got to be doing a lot of things right” Mr Kushner said Mr Kushner did not address why the president for weeks played down the virus comparing it to the ordinary flu predicting that cases would go down to zero and suggesting that the virus would “miraculously” go away People close to the White House have said that Mr Kushner agreed with Mr Trump early on that the Democrats and media were hyping the virus to damage the president although Mr Kushner’s allies have insisted that the always took it seriously In his interview on Wednesday Mr Kushner said May “will be a transition month” as states began reopening “I think you’ll see by June a lot of the country should be back to normal” he said “And the hope is that by July the country’s really rocking again” Gilead Sciences on Wednesday announced that the company “is aware of positive data” from a federal trial of its experimental coronavirus drug remdesivir even as a new study reported that the drug offered no benefit to severely ill patients in China Neither Gilead nor officials at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sponsor of the federal research provided further details about the trial sponsored by NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health President Trump is expected to discuss the findings at a White House briefing later today In the past Mr Trump has hailed remdesivir as a potential “game changer” despite spotty evidence The other study conducted in China and published in the Lancet questioned the value of the drug for treatment of severely ill patients but left open the possibility that it might be useful for others The research was incomplete however because not enough participants could be enrolled Regarding the federal trial the brief announcement by Gilead read “We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing” Trading in the company’s stock was halted before the market opened The news drove stocks higher and the SP 500 rose about 2 percent in early trading The Food and Drug Administration acknowledged that officials were discussing approval of remdesivir for treatment of Covid19 patients presumably under emergency use provisions The NIAID study includes 400 patients who were hospitalized with Covid19 the illness caused by the coronavirus and randomly assigned to take remdesivir or a placebo Outcomes were scored on a scale ranging from recovery to death Remdesivir has never been approved as a treatment for any disease It was developed to fight Ebola but results from a clinical trial in Africa were disappointing Expectations were fueled by anecdotal reports of Covid19 patients who took remdesivir and recovered Two such reports were published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine lending credibility to what researchers later said were uncertain results Without trials comparing the drug to a placebo it has been impossible to know whether the drug made a difference or patients got better on their own with normal supportive care The study of remdesivir published in the Lancet   President Trump and Dr Anthony S Fauci the federal government’s leading epidemiologist on Wednesday hailed the early trial results holding out hope that it could help stem the rising death toll Meeting with reporters at the White House Dr Fauci called the study very optimistic although he cautioned that it still needs to be properly peer reviewed Dr Fauci said the trial suggested that the drug could shorten the time to recovery by about a third “Although a 31 percent improvement doesn’t seem like a knockout 100 percent it is a very important proof of concept because what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus” Dr Fauci said “This is very optimistic” Mr Trump said that “certainly it’s positive it’s a very positive event” But the company noted that remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved in the United States or anywhere else “and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of Covid19” Gov Andrew M Cuomo on Tuesday waded into a struggle between New York City and the state agency that runs the city’s transit system over the issue of homeless people sleeping on subway trains At his daily briefing Mr Cuomo held up a frontpage photograph in   “That is disgusting what is happening on those subway cars” he said adding that what was shown in the image was “disrespectful to the essential workers” who rely on the subway “It’s not even safe for the homeless people to be on trains” he added “No face masks you have this whole outbreak we’re concerned about homeless people so we let them stay on the trains without protection in this epidemic of the Covid virus No We have to do better than that and we will”  came as he announced that the number of coronavirus patients newly admitted to hospitals in New York State had fallen more than 70 percent since the outbreak’s peak this month The number reported on Tuesday was below 1000 for the first time in over a month"},

System and is directly across Fifth Avenue from one of its main hospitals The tents which are operated by the evangelical Christian relief group Samaritan’s Purse have the look of an Ebola treatment

hurricane in the Bahamas and during a diphtheria outbreak in Bangladesh among others The Central Park tent hospital in America’s coronavirus epicenter is the group’s first medical deployment in the United States While Gov Andrew M Cuomo has said that the worst is over if residents remain vigilant and that hospitalization figures continue to flatten medical institutions in New York are still struggling to treat critically ill patients in numbers far exceeding typical capacity “We will be here as long as we are meeting a need” said Melissa Strickland the organization’s communications director The 68bed field hospital in Central Park has 10 ICU beds and ventilators seven of which were being used at the beginning of this week The facility had treated 130 patients as of Tuesday   — a similar number to the Navy hospital ship Comfort which arrived March 30 and has   As of Wednesday six patients at the field hospital had died The clinical staff — more than five dozen emergency response volunteers drawn from the organization’s nationwide roster — work 12hour shifts The infection control protocols they rigorously enforce are different and appear stricter than those being used to treat coronavirus patients in American hospitals where protective equipment has run short health workers are not always trained to use it and many have contracted the coronavirus with some dying Thus far Samaritan’s Purse leaders said none of its workers have fallen ill at the New York field hospital or at a similar one in Cremona Italy While the virus that causes Covid19 is spread differently from Ebola and different protective equipment is needed “the principles are similar” Dr Tenpenny said “We just go over and above a little bit” he added having been able to design the hospital from scratch just over two weeks ago in a green field “You have the privilege of being here in the middle of Central Park We also want to take it as a burden on us not to allow anything to spread” The organization knows the cost of health worker infections One of its doctors Kent Brantly was among the first Americans to contract Ebola in Liberia in 2014 Samaritan’s Purse arranged for a private flight back to the United States and he was treated successfully at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta For the New York field hospital the group brought its own isolation suits face shields rubber boots and gloves which workers wear in a double layer Unlike other hospitals in the city it has not had to ask for government assistance with these supplies or donations from the public “We had stockpiled” Dr Tenpenny said “We have enough” While the field hospital maintains a laboratory and pharmacy and is able to perform Xrays and provide intensive care about a tenth of its patients have had to be transferred to another facility for more specialized treatments On Monday afternoon one of the patients was being transferred out of the tents to an ICU at Mt Sinai “They can provide a higher level so we’re back and forth all the time” Dr Tenpenny said That higherlevel care includes extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO which uses a machine to oxygenate a patient’s blood directly temporarily replacing the function of the heart and lungs On Monday morning Dr David L Reich president of Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai Queens sang out a hello to Samaritan’s Purse workers in the Upper East Side hospital’s lobby who were being trained to use the hospital’s glucose monitors “Your team has been extraordinary” he said offering his elbow for a bump instead of a handshake “We’re just delighted” “Pray for the tents” he said that morning at a command team meeting discussing the weather forecast and plans for potential evacuation “We have stretchers ready to cross Fifth Avenue if necessary ” Dr Reich said the field hospital was considered an extension of Mount Sinai Hospital which as of Tuesday evening was treating 669 people confirmed to have or suspected of having the virus The severely ill were spread across newly created Covid19 units throughout the hospital which is also running   and a simulation laboratory with mannequins to develop new ventilator technologies The larger Mount Sinai health system has redistributed some patients from hardhit areas of Queens Brooklyn and South Nassau on Long Island where its hospitals have been overwhelmed “They’re closer to nursing homes and socioeconomically depressed areas of New York” he said A number of patients from those hospitals have been sent to the tents in Central Park which on Tuesday had 47 according to the relief group “The beauty of the Samaritan’s Purse relationship is they come with staff” Dr Reich said “and very good staff” He added that doctors aim to assign patients to the tent who are “likely to have a stable course of care that does not involve ICUlevel care” Mount Sinai’s vice president for emergency management Don R Boyce a former federal health official was

{"3851": "WASHINGTON —   was a Harvard law student at a Manhattan rooftop cocktail party in the summer of 2015 when a colleague awakened her to the opportunity that was Donald J Trump A fellow summer associate at the whiteshoe law firm Kirkland  Ellis Michael Marcantonio a Democrat had asked her for her favorites in the brewing Republican presidential primary and Ms McEnany a Republican who once had the Gmail handle “RealReaganConservative” dutifully rattled off the names of Marco Rubio Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz Then Mr Marcantonio recalled he interrupted her with some advice “Donald Trump is going to be your nominee” he said adding that if “a smart young blond Harvard graduate” wanted “to get on television and have a career as a political pundit you would be wise to be an early backer” This month after years of television appearances Twitter testimonials and campaign work that date back almost to that party Ms McEnany was   to be his fourth White House press secretary Mr Marcantonio said he still got tongueincheek texts from colleagues “‘This is your fault right’” Just two weeks into her new job Ms McEnany’s energetic spinning of the administration’s struggle against the coronavirus has earned her undying enmity on social media but some grudging respect for her sheer doggedness Like her   Ms McEnany has not held a news briefing but her defense of her boss — and her castigations of the press —   breaks from logic and flights of fantasy “I’m not trying to defend the messaging but what I hope people can acknowledge is there’s very few people in either party who can accomplish what Kayleigh has accomplished in such a short time” said Van Jones a CNN commentator and liberal activist who mentored Ms McEnany when she joined CNN “People keep taking her lightly and they keep regretting it” After Mr Trump mused last week that disinfectants and ultraviolet light “inside the body” might treat the virus Ms McEnany had to work to keep up with Mr Trump’s changing explanations for the comments On Friday she said “Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines” only to watch Mr Trump say his comments were “sarcasm” not misquotes “Taking a sarcastic comment and running with negative headlines is the definition of taking something out of context so I believe those answers are very much in sync” Ms McEnany told reporters on Saturday She then effected another shift “Millions and millions of Americans tune in each day to hear directly from President Trump and appreciate his leadership unprecedented coronavirus response and confident outlook for America’s future” That Ms McEnany would consider a pandemic that has   at least partly through the lens of political messaging seems a function of Mr Trump’s upending of the traditional White House press secretary’s role from public interpreter of policy to campaign pit brawler Since taking the job April 7 Ms McEnany has attended only one of Mr Trump’s public coronavirus briefings as of this week her White House office voice mail wasn’t set up But she appears regularly on Fox News and Twitter bashing the news media and defending the president on his coronavirus response while other Republicans   to do so Ms McEnany whose 32nd birthday on April 18 was noted on air by the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro has spent virtually all her working life inside Trumpworld Her time at Harvard overlapped with her star turn on cable in 2016 where she transformed herself from an obscure Republican opinion writer to a proTrump contributor on CNN But she was using racist language similar to Mr Trump’s long before the formal launch of his political career — or hers Eight years ago a 24yearold Ms McEnany   to offer “How I Met Your Brother — Never mind forgot he’s still in that hut in Kenya” Scottie Nell Hughes another Trump surrogate during the 2016 campaign who often teamed up with Ms McEnany on CNN seemed to see that streak as a plus “The president wants to see a fighter” said Ms Hughes who now works at Russia Today a Russian state TV outlet also known as RT Ms McEnany declined to discuss her role or background for the record although she said in a brief telephone call “I want the truth about me and my character to be out there” Ms McEnany grew up in Tampa Fla the eldest child of a successful roofing contractor A 2005 photograph in The Tampa Bay Times documented an early encounter with network news Ms McEnany huddling up to an ABC microphone with fellow cheerleaders from Academy of the Holy Names Catholic high school “We know we’re a part of something special” she said in the accompanying article She graduated from Georgetown University’s foreign service school in 2010 entered the University of Miami Law School and transferred into Harvard from there graduating in 2016 After college Ms McEnany worked for three years as a production assistant for Mike Huckabee who had a show on Fox News while trying to position herself as centerright pundit “She’s a meticulous researcher” Mr Huckabee said in an interview “She’s extraordinarily prepared” But Fox News refused to give Ms McEnany the onair job she craved “I think one of the reasons that Kayleigh went on to law school was because she didn’t see she was going to have an onair opportunity at Fox anytime soon” Mr Huckabee said Not long after the 2015 rooftop conversation in New York Ms McEnany took a contributor slot at CNN In her 2018 book “The New American Revolution” Ms McEnany attributed her proTrump epiphany to the “hostile advocacy of platitudes over polite dissent dictatorial silencing over thoughtful engagement and censorship over free interchange” that she encountered in academia Part of that “polite dissent” apparently was   when she was 24 including “logic” “when people call him Osama” “Work outside of the golf course” and “THE FACTS” Or   referring to Mr Obama derisively as “son” Ms McEnany spent months defending Mr Trump before ever meeting him said Donna Brazile a former Democratic Party chairwoman and CNN contributor Ms Brazile introduced Ms McEnany to Mr Trump in 2016 buttonholing him before a CNN town hall “It was lightning in a bottle” she recalled “Rarely did Donald Trump come up with any policy but Kayleigh somehow figured out how to step in that gap and make him appear to be a serious candidate” said Ms Brazile now a Fox News contributor In those days Ms McEnany acknowledged occasionally crossing the line in her faceoffs with Democrats “Hi Donna my family mentioned that I got too heated in our discussion I just wanted to apologize and let you know how much I respect you and enjoy your company” she wrote Ms Brazile in an April 26 2016 email “You are a veteran and a legend in politics” Jack Kingston a former Republican congressman and conservative pundit remembered Ms McEnany as a green room workaholic writing opinion pieces while she waited to go on the air a tiny teacup dog tumbling out of her purse “Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani got to be on ‘Hannity’ and Kayleigh and I got the shows where they said ‘In 1968 Donald Trump ran over a pet hamster’” he said “She was a kid to some degree and she was punching back and getting punched and taking it and rolling with it” In 2017 Ms McEnany married Sean Gilmartin a baseball pitcher currently in the minor leagues as part of the Tampa Bay Rays organization And with Mr Trump in the White House Ms McEnany joined the Republican National Committee as national spokeswoman then joined the Trump campaign in a similar role “She defends the president and promotes the president like nobody else She’s also fearless” said Tim Murtaugh communications director for the Trump 2020 campaign “It’s a loss for the campaign but it’s a gain for the White House — it’s all in the same family” Mr Trump’s blurring of those two functions can make Ms McEnany’s White House role hard to distinguish from her campaign role “We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here we will not see terrorism come here and isn’t that refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama” Ms McEnany in her campaign role in late February told the Fox Business anchor Trish Regan who has   after dismissing the coronavirus as a “scam” Ms McEnany said on March 11 “The media’s best hope is for Donald Trump to suspend his rallies We’re not going to cave to the media” As White House press secretary Ms McEnany continues to portray the president’s coronavirus response as “extraordinary” On April 16 she   the false claim that “Under President realDonaldTrump’s leadership we have quickly developed the most expansive and accurate testing system in the world” No coordinated national testing system exists Ms McEnany has   the number of test kits distributed with the number of tests actually performed a substantially lower number She has used the larger less meaningful numbers to   and falsely claim   retweeted by the president that putative Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden “lied” Last week after Dr Robert Redfield director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   “There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through” Ms McEnany falsely claimed he was misquoted The CDC director “was very clear in saying look we might have flu reemerge in the fall” she told reporters “All Americans need to go out and get their flu shots that was the thrust of his comments but you know leave it to the media to really take those out of context” Mr Redfield then contradicted her interpretation in the White House coronavirus briefing on Wednesday Ms McEnany was not in the room"},

the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11 indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus” The projections confirm the primary fear of public health experts that a reopening of the economy will put the nation back where it was in midMarch when cases were rising so rapidly in some parts of the country that patients were dying on gurneys in hospital hallways On Sunday Mr Trump said   twice as many as he had forecast two weeks ago But that new number still underestimates what his own administration is now predicting to be the total death toll by the end of May — much less in the months to come It follows a pattern for Mr Trump who has frequently understated the impact of the disease “We’re going to lose anywhere from 75 80 to 100000 people” he said in a virtual town hall on Fox News on Sunday “That’s a horrible thing We shouldn’t lose one person over this” The White House responded that the new federal government

to rise include Iowa Minnesota Tennessee and Texas according to the data About half of all states have now begun reopening their economies in some significant way which public health experts have warned could lead to a new wave of cases and deaths “The vast majority of Americans have not been exposed to the virus there is not immunity and the initial conditions that allowed this virus to

improved as shown by data collected by The Times Case and death numbers remain on a numbing tragic plateau that is tilting only slightly downward At least 1000 people with the virus and sometimes more than 2000 have died every day for the last month On a near daily basis at least 25000 new cases of the virus are being identified across the country And even as New York City New Orleans and Detroit have shown improvement other urban centers including Chicago and Los Angeles are reporting steady growth in the number of cases The situation has devolved most significantly in parts of rural America that were largely spared in the early stages of the pandemic As food processing facilities and prisons have emerged as some of the country’s largest case clusters the counties that include Logansport

a sixfoot barrier around them The White House has barred members of its coronavirus task force and their aides from appearing before Congress this month without the express approval of Mark Meadows the White House chief of staff according to an email obtained by The New York Times In addition officials with “primary response departments” including the Departments of State Health and Human Services and Homeland Security will be restricted to appearing at four hearings departmentwide for the duration of May The White House Office of Legislative Affairs laid out the policy in an email to senior congressional aides noting that it could change before the end of the month “Agencies must maximize their resources for Covid19 response efforts and treat hearing requests accordingly” the message said That argument was repeated by a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment Democrats condemned the move saying it reflected an impulse by the president to silence health experts “By muzzling science and the truth it will only prolong this health and economic crisis” said Senator Chuck Schumer Democrat of New York and the minority leader “The president’s failure to accept the truth and then his desire to hide it is one of the chief reasons we are lagging behind so many other countries in beating this scourge” Senator Lamar Alexander Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the committee said on Monday that a May 12 hearing — what he called a “status report on going back to work back to school” — would

Justice Roberts asked the first questions and then called on his colleagues When lawyers gave extended answers he cut them off and asked the next justice to ask questions The question before the court was whether an online hotel reservation company Bookingcom may trademark its name Generic terms cannot be trademarked and all concerned agreed that “booking” standing alone was generic The question for the justices was whether the addition of “com” changed the analysis The court will hear 10 cases by phone over the next two weeks including three on May 12 about subpoenas from prosecutors and Congress   which could yield a politically explosive decision as the presidential campaign enters high gear The justices may not return to the bench in October the start of their next term if the

other health precautions in place The governor of California said on Monday that some stores could reopen on Friday and that individual counties if they desired could relax restrictions further as long as they took precautions Gov Gavin Newsom a Democrat said the businesses including clothing stores bookstores florists and sporting goods stores would be allowed to reopen with modifications The manufacturing businesses that supply these shops would also be permitted to reopen The announcement was a cautious but serious step toward removing some of the most severe restrictions that California had placed on everyday life Dozens of states — led largely by those with Republican governors — have   to slow the spread of the coronavirus “This is a very positive sign and it’s happened only for one reason” Mr Newsom   “The data says it can happen” Mr Newsom and the state’s top health official Dr Sonia Angell sounded optimistic trumpeting the state’s testing capabilities — about 30000 a day — and its stable number of daily hospitalizations Store owners will be allowed to open for pickup on Friday only if they alter their workplaces and they must enforce social distancing Mr Newsom added that more details about the required modifications would be released on Thursday The governor also said that if local health officials and county governments certify that they are ready to reopen

Japan to Canada Australia to Norway — took turns announcing their countries’ contributions to fund laboratories that have promising leads in developing and producing a vaccine For Romania it was

charges against the customer along with her husband and son who is accused of shooting the security guard Calvin Munerlyn on Friday afternoon According to the prosecutor after Mr Munerlyn told the customer Sharmel Teague that her daughter needed to wear a mask inside the store Ms Teague yelled and spat at him prompting the security guard to tell her to leave and instructing a cashier not to serve her Ms Teague left the store and called her husband Larry Teague who returned to the store with her son Ramonyea Travon Bishop according to Mr Layton Mr Bishop is accused of then shooting Mr

officials condemned a man who was photographed   while shopping at a supermarket outside San Diego Researchers at two Harvardaffiliated hospitals are   to develop a potential coronavirus vaccine which they expect to test in people later this year they announced on Monday Their work uses a method already present in gene therapy for two inherited diseases including a form of blindness A harmless virus serves as a vector or carrier to bring DNA into the patient’s cells In this case the DNA should instruct the cells to make a coronavirus protein that would stimulate the immune system to fight future infections So far the researchers have studied the vaccine candidates only in mice But two of seven promising versions are already being readied for studies in humans The research is one of at least  around the world Like other vaccine projects this one is focusing on the socalled spike on the coronavirus which the virus uses to grab onto cells and invade them In theory if the immune system can be trained to make antibodies to block the spike the virus will not be able to establish an infection One advantage of this approach if it proves safe and effective is that many drug and biotech companies already produce the type of vector it relies on That means production could be scaled up quickly As with other vaccine projects much is still unknown including the possibility that the vaccine could actually make the disease worse They did not treat patients but Wayne Edwards Derik Braswell and Priscilla Carrow held some of the most vital jobs at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens

people   It’s mainly for the nurses and doctors I get it But people are not seeing the other parts of the hospital” said Eneida Becote whose husband died last month after working for two decades as a patient transporter The Food and Drug Administration announced on Monday that companies selling coronavirus antibody tests   within the next 10 days or face removal from the market The antibody tests are an effort to detect whether a person had been infected with the virus but results have been widely varied and little is known about whether those who became ill will develop immunity — and if so for how long Government and health officials have hoped that antibody tests would be a critical tool to help determine when it would be safe to lift stayathome restrictions and reopen businesses Since midMarch the agency has permitted dozens of manufacturers to sell the tests without providing evidence that they are accurate Many are wildly off the mark The FDA’s action came after   by more than 50

had worked for the company for more than five years called the fired workers whistleblowers and said that firing them was “evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture” Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment The intelligence agencies sought on Monday to back Mr Trump’s assertions that he was given only minimal warnings about the threat of the coronavirus early in the year singling out their own lapses without noting that around the same time scientists public health officials and national security officials were sounding alarms Mr Trump was first briefed by intelligence agencies about the novel coronavirus on Jan 23 said Susan Miller the spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence But she acknowledged that the initial briefing downplayed its threat Mr Trump was “told that the good news was the virus did not appear that deadly” Ms Miller said As the world painfully learned that assessment was wrong Ms Miller’s statement came after weeks of Mr Trump and administration officials railing at what they have called inaccurate accounts in the news media that intelligence agencies put multiple warnings about the virus in the president’s daily intelligence briefing On Sunday Mr Trump said the intelligence agencies in January had told him the virus was “ ” Though information about the virus in late January was imperfect the warnings from other officials were stark enough to prompt the Trump administration to decide by the end of January to restrict travel from China Some intelligence officials have said that the pandemic’s spread had never been fundamentally an intelligence issue and that the warnings of scientists had always been far more important When the warnings that intelligence agencies did give to officials were combined with what public health and biodefense officials were learning a clearer picture of a global threat emerged early By focusing on what Mr Trump was told in January administration officials are also able to distract from the timeline of events in February It was during that month that   led to wasted time and delays in responding to the crisis At least 12 countries began easing restrictions on public life on Monday as the world tried to figure out how to placate restless populations tired of being inside and reboot stalled economies without creating opportunities for the virus to reemerge The steps which include reopening schools and allowing airports to begin domestic service offer the rest of the world a preview of how areas that have managed to blunt the toll might work toward resuming their prepandemic lives They also serve as test cases for whether the countries can maintain their positive momentum through the reopenings or if the desire for normalcy could place more people at risk Most of the countries easing their restrictions are in Europe including Italy one of the places where the virus hit earliest and hardest leaving   The country plans to reopen some airports to passengers In Germany where   children will return to schools Austria also plans to restart its school system In Lebanon bars and restaurants will reopen while Poland plans to allow patrons to return to hotels museums and shops India allowed businesses local transportation and activities like weddings to resume in areas with few or no known infections Wedding ceremonies with fewer than 50 guests will be permitted and selfemployed workers like maids and plumbers can return to work Mr Trump accused the Chinese government of making a “horrible mistake” in its virus response and of then orchestrating a coverup that allowed the pathogen to spread “They tried to cover it they tried to put it out It’s like a fire” Mr Trump said on Sunday night during a   “You know it’s really like trying to put out a fire They couldn’t put out the fire” China did   with a harsh lockdown but public health experts have criticized Beijing for   and   Mr Trump who has come under fierce criticism for his handling of the crisis also issued the latest in a   laying blame on China for the creation and spread of the virus “We’re going to be giving a very strong
