This directory contains files for scraping the news article data from the web. This is not intended to be reporoducible unless the user 
has and can use Scrapy. The only relevant files are the foxnews.py where the function is listed. 
In order to reproduce this properly, please download scrapy, generate a spider and and use the foxnews.py file.  

Notes:
ID: 4265: the scraping is wrong because it is not a news article. It is a live update tracker, which has now been discontinued.
For wsj.com, i am not able to scrape. The Xpath selector works on the website, but not on the downloaded respose. Anyways, it is just 4 articles, so i think we can ignore them.
