  After New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called upon lawyers in the state to volunteer to assist with COVID-19- related cases pro bono, the New York State Bar Association created a task force to handle the demand. 
  The initial request sought lawyers to help residents apply for unemployment benefits, however, according to the  Bar Association ,  “the network is quickly gearing up to handle a range of other issues from evictions to domestic violence to job and housing discrimination.”
  The New York State Bar Association is working with the state court system to establish a “COVID-19 Recovery Task Force” made up of lawyers, law school deans and legal clerks to assist with the caseload.
  The task force will be responsible for “setting priorities, recruiting lawyers, coordinating resources and connecting lawyers and clients."
