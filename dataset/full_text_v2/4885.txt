  New Zealand  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern  on Monday declared the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy "essential workers" — while gently warning kids that Peter Cottontail might miss his annual visit.
  "You'll be pleased to know that we do consider both the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny to be essential workers," Ardern  told reporters,   updating her nation's struggle against COVID-19.
  The prime minister smiled as she asked children to be understanding if the egg-carrying rabbit can't get to everyone by Sunday: "And so I say to the children of New Zealand, if the Easter Bunny doesn't make it to your household, then we have to understand that it is a bit difficult at the moment for the bunny to perhaps get everywhere."
