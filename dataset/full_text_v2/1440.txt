  The president of the European Commission — the executive branch of the European Union — offered an apology to Italy on Thursday, saying the country did not receive adequate help at the beginning of the  coronavirus  pandemic.
  "Yes it is true that no one was really ready for this," Ursula von der Leyen said in an address to the European Parliament. "It is also true that too many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning. And yes for that, it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology."
  Saying that while “there are no words that can do justice to Europe's pain,” von der Leyen also looked ahead in her address. She discussed ways the E.U. planned to support and reshape industries, and invest in digital technologies, infrastructure and the European Green Deal.
  While  countries across Europe have suffered  from the virus outbreak, Italy has been hit the hardest,  particularly in the earlier weeks of the outbreak . More than 21,000 people have died in Italy as of Thursday, the highest death toll in Europe. The country has begun to  ease some lockdown measures  this week.
