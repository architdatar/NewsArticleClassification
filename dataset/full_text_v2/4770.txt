  The class of 2020 will have the chance to celebrate graduating, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday. 
  "Beginning July 6th, schools WILL have the opportunity to hold outdoor graduation ceremonies that comply with social distancing – ensuring the health and safety of all in attendance," the governor said in a  tweet . 
  The Department of Education and the Secretary of Higher Education will release guidance on Wednesday. For graduating classes that are too large to accommodate the governor's rule that no more than 25 people can gather outdoor, schools may have to hold multiple ceremonies. 
  "We want them to celebrate and to be celebrated by their family, friends and educators who helped get them there," Murphy said.
