  Members of the House might need to return to Washington this week to vote on an interim coronavirus package to aid small businesses and hospitals. 
  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., sent out guidance to lawmakers Sunday saying that the House could meet as early as 10 a.m. on Wednesday to consider the legislation. Negotiators said over the weekend that they were nearing an agreement on the bill. 
  "Members will be given sufficient notice about the exact timing of any votes and when they will need to return to Washington, DC," the guidance said. 
  Lawmakers have been home in their districts during the coronavirus outbreak, but will need to travel for the vote because there are no remote voting capabilities in place.
