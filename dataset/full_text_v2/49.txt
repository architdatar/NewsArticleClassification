  White House senior adviser Kevin Hassett said Sunday it's "scary" to go to work in the West Wing after two Trump administration staffers tested positive for COVID-19 within the past week.
  Hassett, who formerly served as President Donald Trump's top economic adviser,  told CBS's "Face the Nation " he practices "aggressive social distancing" and will "wear a mask when I feel it's necessary."
  "It is scary to go to work," he said. "I was not part of the White House in March. I think that I'd be a lot safer if I was sitting at home instead of going to the West Wing. But, you know, it's a time when people have to step up and serve their country."
