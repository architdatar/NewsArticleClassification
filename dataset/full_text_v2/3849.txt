  The Supreme Court said Monday that it will hear half of the remaining cases of the term by telephone conference call — a first for the court — with the justices and the lawyers calling in remotely.
  Among the 10 cases to be heard is the legal battle over access by Congress and a Manhattan prosecutor to President  Trump's tax returns and other financial documents . The court will also take up an important issue involving the  presidential electors  who meet in December to cast the actual vote for president. The question is whether they must vote for the candidates who won the popular vote in their states or are instead free agents.
  The cases were to be heard in March and April and now will be argued during the first two weeks in May. Audio of the argument sessions will be provided live to the news media and made available to the public.
