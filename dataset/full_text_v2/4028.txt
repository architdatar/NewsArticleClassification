  Georgia Gov. Brian P. Kemp issued  a new Covid-19 executive order  Saturday, according to a statement from the governor’s office. The order extends the shelter-in-place order for the medically fragile, continues the ban on large gatherings and maintains health and safety protocols for Georgia businesses, Kemp said in his statement. The order "protects Georgia businesses from government overreach by restricting the application and enforcement of local masking requirements to public property. While I support local control, it must be properly balanced with property rights and personal freedoms," Kemp said in the statement. 
  The order says local governments "who choose to impose a Local Option Face Covering Requirement" must not fine businesses, fine violators more than $50 or enforce masks at polling places, the order says. Masks cannot be enforced on private property, the order says. Anyone who violates local mask rules must be warned about the health risks of not doing so before a citation is issued, according to the order.

  12:53 a.m. ET, August 16, 2020 New Zealand reports 13 new cases, as the most populous city goes back under lockdown From CNN's Sol Han Cars queue at a Covid-19 test center in Auckland, New Zealand, on August 13. Dean Purcel/AP 
  New Zealand has recorded 13 new cases of coronavirus in the past day, health officials said Sunday, as the country maintains new restrictions amid a sudden Covid-19 outbreak. Of the new cases, 12 were in the Auckland community, with none having traveled outside the region recently. All had close links to the existing outbreak; two of the new cases belonged to the same household as a previously confirmed patient. The remaining case is a child in managed isolation who arrived in early August from Afghanistan. New Zealand has recorded 1,271 confirmed cases since the pandemic began, said health authorities. It currently has 61 active cases, of which 49 were locally transmitted and 20 were imported from abroad. Auckland under lockdown:  On Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that Auckland -- the city of around 1.5 million people at the center of the new outbreak -- will remain under a level three lockdown for another 12 days, while the rest of the country stays under level two restrictions, meaning gatherings are limited to no more than 100 people.  The rules extend restrictions that came into effect earlier this week. Just five days before then, New Zealand was marking an enviable milestone --  100 days  without any community transmission. But  this week  demonstrated how fast that can change, even in a country that been held up as a  world leader  for its handling of the virus.

  12:01 a.m. ET, August 16, 2020 CDC blindsided by Trump's statement it could deploy teams to schools this fall From CNN's Nick Valencia Leaders at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were blindsided this week when President Donald Trump announced that the agency could deploy teams to assist schools with safely reopening in the fall, a senior CDC official told CNN, the latest example of a breakdown in communication between the agency and the White House. My administration also stands ready to deploy CDC teams to support schools that are opening and schools that need help in safety and in order to safely reopen," President Trump said on Tuesday during a briefing. 
  The announcement left CDC officials scrambling this week to train staff to be able to deploy if they are called upon, the senior official said.  The surprise statement by Trump was reminiscent of early on in the pandemic when the CDC Task Force regularly learned about assignments during presidential briefings, finding out in real time along with the public, a senior official said. The CDC official said the agency is expected to come up with a vaccine plan for schools in at least four states by October, even though there is no realistic expectation that a vaccine would be ready by then.
