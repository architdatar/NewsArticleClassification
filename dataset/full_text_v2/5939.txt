  Brandon Truett's parents surprised him with a celebratory billboard near his South Carolina hometown, congratulating him for finishing his University of Chicago PhD in English.
  "My dad was thinking of ways to celebrate because he knew the graduation was canceled," Truett said. "I always think I'm the extra one, but he really topped me on this one."
  Truett said he defended his dissertation, the last assignment before becoming a PhD, on a video conference, which allowed his parents to watch.Â He said his father, who rented the billboard in South Carolina, would not have been able to attend his defense because of his demanding work schedule.
  "My dad has always been supportive, but this is the culminating gesture," said Truett, who added his father is currently reading his 250-page dissertation on visual art and the Spanish Civil War.
