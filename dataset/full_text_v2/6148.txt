  Gov. Greg Abbott visited Orange, Texas, on Thursday to survey storm damage left by Hurricane Laura overnight. 
  In a news conference at Orange City Hall, Abbott said that the city experienced significant damage with rooftops ripped off, trees downed and some roads underwater. 
  However, Abbott said that the devastation from the now-tropical storm could have been a lot worse for the city, which is along the Sabine River in eastern Texas. The area initially braced for a 10-foot storm surge, however it was only 3 feet.
  “When you consider the magnitude of the damage that could have occurred here, we dodged a bullet,” said Abbott. “If we make it through a Category 4 hurricane that ripped through the coastline all the way up through the Texarkana area, and we have been able to have minimal or perhaps no loss of life — that’s a miracle.”
  Hundreds of thousands of customers remained without power Thursday afternoon because of the storm.
  Almost 8,500 people were provided shelter throughout Texas, with more than 3,000 hotel rooms sheltering evacuees. Residents located in congregate shelters will have access to COVID-19 testing, according to Abbott.  
  The governor added that they are now standing by to respond to flash flooding and potential tornados.
