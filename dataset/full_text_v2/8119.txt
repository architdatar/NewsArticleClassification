  As Utah begins to  reopen its economy , the state is promising a face mask to anyone who needs one, free of charge.
  Gov. Gary Hebert this week announced the  new initiative , called “A Mask for Every Utahn.”
  Funding for this program comes from the CARES Act.  The program is designed to get a mask into the hands of everyone, especially those who do not have access to them. They are being made by Utah manufacturing companies.  This is a one-time program to create 2 million masks.  pic.twitter.com/h89z44QNa4 
  “We want to do everything we can as we work together as a state to combat COVID-19,” Gov. Hebert said in a  statement . “Wearing a mask when we are out in public may not be convenient, but it can help slow the spread of the virus. Let’s all do our part in stopping the spread and helping to protect those around us.”
  The project, funded through the federal CARES Act, will produce two million masks for the state’s residents in partnership with the Utah Manufacturers Association and Cotopaxi, an outdoor apparel company. The masks will all be made in Utah and the order will help employ more than 200 residents, according to the  news release .
  Residents are able to request a mask through an  online form  on the state’s coronavirus website.
