  Good Tuesday morning. Tips, comments, recipes?  Reach out  and  sign up . Thanks for waking up with us. 
  🚨  HAPPENING THIS MORNING:  Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert; Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn,  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and other top officials  are set to testify  in front of a Senate committee starting at 10:00 a.m. 
  TRUMP VS. MAJORITIES OF AMERICANS:  As the death toll surpassed 80,000 people in the United States, President Trump claimed that the country is already “transitioning to greatness” as it bests the rest of the world in  coronavirus  testing. 
  Trump, addressing a crowd of otherwise masked reporters and administration officials in the Rose Garden from his own lectern, insisted the country's testing capacity is  “unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world. ”   
  But there's still a vast discrepancy between Trump's eagerness to reopen the country  —  and Americans across the country who indicate they're more willing to keep social distancing measures in place even at an economic cost.  
  The political risks for governors reopening their states are becoming increasingly apparent.  While collectively, governors are earning much higher approval ratings than Trump for their handling of the coronavirus crisis, the latest Post-Ipsos poll finds that Republican governors who were slower to close and eager to open their states are receiving more negative ratings. 
  BY THE NUMBERS: And the breakdown of the testing numbers tells a different story than the rosy outlook Trump offered.  “The White House event Monday afternoon amounted to an acknowledgment that there is not yet enough testing capacity across the United States, even as more than 40 states are in some stage of lifting restrictions on travel, work and school,” our colleagues  Anne Gearan, Brady Dennis, Phil Rucker and John Wagner report.  
  Democrats are seizing on Trump's suggestions of victory  —  and repeated minimizations of the trajectory of the coronavirus throughout the United States. Yesterday's news conference is sure to provide more fodder.  
  MORE MONEY COMING:  Administration officials announced yesterday that $11 billion in aid will be distributed to states to ramp up testing capacities — an implicit acknowledgment that testing in most places is not where it needs to be.  Fauci,  Redfield and Hahn  —  and testing coordinator Brett Giroir  —  are likely to be pressed to square Trump's remarks on the current state of play during the today's  Senate health committee hearing .  
  WHITE HOUSE MANDATES MASKS, BUT NOT FOR TRUMP: “ A memo instructed most White House officials to wear masks or face coverings in the West Wing, as well as avoid ‘unnecessary visits’ there — directives to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading further inside the presidential compound,”  Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report .
  Inside the White House:  “Trump feels both frustrated and stuck, said one Republican close to the White House: He can’t go out and campaign, coronavirus deaths are climbing, his poll numbers are faltering, and he believes he is not getting sufficient credit for his handling of the pandemic,” our colleagues write.
  LET US DIS-PENCE:  The vice president got little public backup yesterday for his decision not follow the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention's guidance to self-isolate for 14 days after his press secretary tested positive. 
  Trump and Pence are expected to maintain distance from each other:  A senior administration official  told our colleagues  that will be for the immediate future and that the two leaders are unlikely to be in the same room. “It can and will be evaluated on an as-needed basis,” the official said.
  Hasty exit:  Trump abruptly ended his news conference amid persistent questioning from two female reporters. 
  SCOTUS HEARS TRUMP TAX RETURNS CASE: “ The court will spend hours in teleconferenced hearings — with the world listening in — on three cases with potential landmark constitutional consequences,”  Robert Barnes and Ann E. Marimow report . Due to the pandemic this marks the first time we could hear potentially landmark cases in real time — arguments start at 10 a.m.  The ruling is expected come this summer, potentially upending the presidential campaign. 
  A reminder of where things stand:  “All involve Trump’s effort to stop his longtime accounting firm and two banks from handing over his financial information to Democratic-led House committees and the Manhattan district attorney. The timing means the high court’s rulings will likely land this summer — in the heat of Trump’s reelection campaign,”  Ann and Robert write in their explainer this morning .
  Trump has few allies in the fight:  “His major backer is his own Justice Department, which says the subpoenas are improper but does not fully embrace the legal arguments of the president’s private lawyers. The number of friend-of-the-court briefs filed on Trump’s behalf are dwarfed by those on the other side,” our colleagues write.
  THE LATEST IN THE DMV:  “Gov. Ralph Northam confirmed that   he expects to hold Northern Virginia out of the gradual, ‘phase one’ reopening of the rest of the state later this week, describing a state starkly cleaved in two by the coronavirus,”  Michael E. Miller, Gregory S. Schneider and Fenit Nirappil report .
  The pressure on Northam:  “Republicans in rural parts of the state have argued that their areas are not as affected by the pandemic, and merchants in some tourist-heavy regions — such as Hampton Roads — say their economies will be wrecked if they can’t start reopening as summer approaches,” our colleagues write.
  IN THE DISTRICT:  “D.C. officials unveiled a makeshift hospital overflow center at the downtown Walter E. Washington Convention Center that will be able to treat nearly 500 covid-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms, preserving hospital space for those who need to be in intensive care or on ventilators,” our colleagues write.
  WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW: 
  Tribal nations are facing their worst crisis in decades:  “The Navajo Nation, the country’s largest Indian reservation, now has a higher death rate than any U.S. state except New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts,”  the New York Times's Simon Romero and Jack Healy report .
  McConnell says former president Obama “should have kept his mouth shut” about the coronavirus response:  "I think it's a little bit classless, frankly, to critique an administration that comes after you," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, during a Trump campaign live stream,  CNN's Donald Judd and Paul LeBlanc report . "You had your shot, you were there for eight years. I think the tradition that the Bush's set up -- of not critiquing the president who comes after you -- is a good tradition."
  Facebook fights back:  The social network “is working behind the scenes to help launch a new political advocacy group that would combat U.S. lawmakers and regulators trying to rein in the tech industry, escalating Silicon Valley’s war with Washington at a moment when government officials are threatening to break up large companies,”  Tony Romm reports this morning . The organization is called American Edge.
