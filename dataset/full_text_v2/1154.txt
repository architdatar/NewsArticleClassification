  Chicago will host a slate of new summer events, including at-home dance parties, drive-in movies, virtual concerts and community meals for frontline workers, Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot said in a news release Tuesday.
  The Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Event will produce more than 150 events this summer to replace many of the city's annual events that were cancelled due to the pandemic, Lightfoot said.
  “We must provide ways for people to enjoy the spirit of a Chicago summer while prioritizing health and safety,” she said in a statement. “As difficult as it is to remove these in-person events from our calendar, we are pulling out all the stops for an inventive, engaging and fun festival season this summer.”
