  Neighbors on a British street hung out of windows and stood in gardens to sing "Happy Birthday" in unison to Sophia Thomas as she celebrated turning 8 in quarantine on Wednesday.
  The display of community affection in Southampton, southern England, for the child spending her birthday indoors as part of  Britain's ongoing lockdown response to the coronavirus  was captured and shared online by her father, Rob Thomas, and has now been widely shared online, he said.
  "Sophia is blown away, absolutely blown away by it. ... It's all going a bit crazy," he told NBC News.

  Sophia's parents put out a request on a neighborhood WhatsApp group for cards and virtual messages to cheer up their daughter and were taken aback when the neighborhood agreed to the sing-a-long.
