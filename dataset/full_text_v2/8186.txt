  Walmart and Sam's Club employees will be required to wear masks or face coverings at work.
  TheÂ new policy, which takes effect Monday, follows other initiatives such as temperature checks and distancing guidance. Face coverings were earlier considered optional for employees.
  "You can provide your own as long as it meets certain guidelines, or we will provide you with one as you pass your associate health screen and temperature check," company officials wrote in a statement  posted online late Friday .
  Walmart was  sued earlier this month  by the family of a worker at a Chicago-area store who died of coronavirus.
