  The head of the Food and Drug Administration said 1.1 million  tests  have been sent to labs, with a focus on hard-hit states, such as Washington and California.
  Dr. Steven Hahn made the announcement during a White House briefing Saturday. He said he expects another million to be sent by Monday. And, he said, as many as 4 million could be ready by the end of next week.Â 
  So far, 72 state and local public health labs in 48 states are able to test for the coronavirus.
  Also on Saturday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar clarified comments President Trump made Friday when he  suggested anyone could get a test . Azar said Trump was using "shorthand" and explained health officials are no longer restricting testing if a doctor determines one is necessary.
