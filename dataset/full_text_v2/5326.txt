  A person in Kentucky who recently attended a "coronavirus party"  has now tested positive for the virus,  Gov. Andy Beshear said. 
  Beshear at press conference on Tuesday chided Kentuckians who are not taking the pandemic seriously.
  "We have a positive coronavirus case today from someone who attended a coronavirus party," Beshear told reporters. "Anyone who goes to something like this may think they are indestructible, but it is someone else's loved one that they are going to hurt."
  "We are battling for the health and even the lives of our parents and our grandparents," Beshear warned. "Don't be so callous as to intentionally go to something and expose yourself to something that can kill other people. We ought to be much better than that."
  As of Tuesday evening, at least 163 people have tested positive and four people have died from coronavirus in Kentucky.
