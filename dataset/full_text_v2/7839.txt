  The U.K. is working to make more Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) domestically while also entering into talks with international factories, Britain’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Tuesday.
  Hancock said the government had more than 8,000 offers of PPE equipment as of Monday and was investigating each one, while working with 159 potential U.K. manufacturers.
  “We’re working day and night to expand that supply base,” Hancock said during Britain’s daily coronavirus briefing.
  The government has come under fire in recent weeks after shortages of PPE have been reported in some British hospitals.
  The  British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, warned earlier this month  that National Health Service staff had reported  “dangerously low levels” of PPE  in London and Yorkshire, putting medics and patients increasingly in harm’s way.
