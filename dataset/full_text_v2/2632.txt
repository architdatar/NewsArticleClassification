  WASHINGTON — Democratic candidates and aligned groups are outspending their Republican counterparts in the two weeks since President Trump announced guidelines aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. 
  There's been $23.5 million spent on political advertising from March 16 (the day the administration announced its "15 Days to Slow the Spread" guidelines) through Tuesday, with Democrats making up 69 percent of that ($16.2 million), Republicans making up 29 percent of that ($6.7 million), and independent groups filling in that last 2 percent. 
  All of these figures are from the ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics. 
  Four of the top five biggest spenders over this period were Democrats:
  The ad backed by the most spending in that window was from Priorities USA, which is  running an ad that's criticizing Trump's response  to the coronavirus outbreak. It's spent $1.2 million to run that spot so far. 
  The ad with the second-most money behind it is from Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign,  attacking Biden on Social Security and Medicare . Although both Biden and Sanders have wound down their ad spending to a virtual halt recently, Sanders spent $620,000 to run the ad over the time period. Virtually all of that came in the days surrounding the March 17 primaries, the ad has barely run since. 
  The Republican-aligned ad with the most spending behind it in recent weeks has been from One Nation, a  spot that plays up  Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst's work on prescription drugs. That spot has had $333,000 behind it since March 16. 
  During this time period, the top markets were the Portland-Aurburn market in Maine, Phoenix, and two markets in Florida covering Orlando and Tampa.
  Maine is home to GOP Sen. Susan Collins' re-election race; Arizona held its presidential primary on March 17 and has a competitive Senate race; and Florida also held its presidential primary on March 17.
