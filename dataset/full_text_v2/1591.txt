  Hundreds of prisoners in Ecuador will begin making wooden coffins to help cover a shortage emerging due to the  coronavirus  outbreak.
  The health crisis has prompted a shortage of coffins in Guayaquil, one of the worst hit regions, prompting some families to bury their relatives in cardboard boxes donated to cemeteries by private companies.
  "The Environment Ministry is donating seized wood, which would have gone toward other purposes for a noble cause: give a wooden coffin to families who have lost a loved one," Environment Minister Juan DeHowitt said in a statement.
  Prisoners in Ambato city plan to start delivering the coffins next week.
