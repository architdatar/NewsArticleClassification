  Kylie Jenner is donating $1 million to help with the shortage of hospital masks, face shields and other protective gear.
  The reality star's doctor, Thaïs Aliabadi, said in an  Instagram post  on Wednesday that the donation will help buy "hundreds of thousands" of supplies for first responders during the coronavirus pandemic. 
  "Too many masks at hospitals are disappearing before making their way onto the faces of our front line heroes," she wrote. "I have never felt more blessed to be a doctor, as helping our brave ER and ICU workers feels just as gratifying as helping my own patients. From the bottom of our hearts, THANK YOU @kyliejenner."  
  Aliabadi, who delivered Jenner's daughter, Stormi, said the donation will most likely "help save many precious lives."
