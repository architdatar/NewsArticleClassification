  A San Francisco venture capital fund that has invested in Airbnb and Uber warned partners Friday that the coronavirus pandemic has been a sudden shock similar to the 1906 earthquake that leveled much of the city. 
  Bond Capital is led by Mary Meeker, who has  a large following  in Silicon Valley where her annual reports on internet trends are eagerly consumed by entrepreneurs and fellow investors. 
  "Earthquakes are like high-speed zippers that rip open the earth," Meeker and the rest of the fund's team wrote in the 29-page  letter , which was first  reported  by Axios. 
  The letter says COVID-19 may be a "call to arms" to rethink health care, which "in the U.S. hasn't changed as much as you would think since the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918."
