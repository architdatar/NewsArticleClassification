  The number of patients in intensive care in France fell for a sixth day in a row Tuesday, with 91 fewer people in intensive care than the day before.
  There are currently 6,730 patients in intensive care in France out of 71,903 people hospitalized.
  The country has recorded more than 15,000 coronavirus-related deaths since March 1, making it one of the worst hit globally.
  French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday evening  that while the number of patients in intensive care units was falling, the epidemic was still not under control, as he extended lockdown measures until May 11.
