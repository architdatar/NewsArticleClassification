  2 Chainz, born Tauheed Epps, grew up in College Park, a mostly black city in Georgia.
  A video clip posted to his  Instagram  and  Twitter  accounts Monday showed a line of people maintaining a social distance outside of the restaurant. 
  A plan announced last week by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp  allowed restaurants to resume dine-in service , and movie theaters and other entertainment venues to reopen Monday. 
  2 Chainz said in an Instagram  post  that his restaurant would only be open for takeout.
