  Miami's police chief, Jorge Colina, tested positive for coronavirus, he announced in a message to his department.
  "My symptoms are mild, my spirits are high and I have every reason to believe that I will have a full recovery," Colina wrote.
  He said he is remaining in isolation until tests show that he's "no longer at risk for spreading the virus to coworkers."
  Deputy Chief Ronald Papier is serving as acting chief in Colina's absence.
