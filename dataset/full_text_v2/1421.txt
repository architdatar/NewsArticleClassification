  Aid workers are bracing for a possible outbreak of the coronavirus in one of the world's largest refugee camps in Bangladesh, with officials warning that containing the disease among more than 1 million tightly packed Rohingya will be a daunting task.
  With about 103,600 people per square mile living in plastic shacks side by side — which is more than 40 times the average density of Bangladesh — the refugees are dangerously exposed to the virus. Each shack is barely 100 square feet and many are overcrowded with up to 12 people.
  There have been no reported cases of infection in the camps yet, but officials remain concerned.  Rohingya people fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017 , and were forced into squalid camps across the border in Bangladesh — a country that is currently under a lockdown until April 11.
