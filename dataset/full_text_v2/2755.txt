  The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its five-day rally on Friday, after the monthly jobs report revealed  2.5 million positions were added to the economy last month,  the largest monthly gain on record. Economists had predicted 8 million jobs would be lost.
  Confidence in a faster economic recovery boosted all three major averages, with the Dow closing up by 829 points at the closing bell, or just over 3 percent. The S&P closed up by 2.6 percent and the Nasdaq gained 2 percent, reaching a record high.
  Companies that would benefit from a return to travel and tourism saw some of the strongest gains, with American Airlines up by 8 percent and MGM Resorts up 2.4 percent. Boeing provided the biggest boost for the blue-chip Dow, gaining more than 11 percent.
  President Donald Trump described the jobs report as "amazing," "incredible," and "really big."
  "This shows that what we've been doing is right," he said in a news briefing from the White House Rose Garden on Friday morning.
