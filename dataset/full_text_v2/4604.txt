  More than 100 New York Police Department employees have tested positive for COVID-19, a senior law enforcement official told NBC News.
  One hundred of those infected are sworn officers, the official said. Twenty-nine are civilians. They are among more 2,400 employees who are out sick.
  The department employs 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilians.
  The NYPD distributed 75,000 face masks to its officers over the weekend, but the official said the number of infected employees is expected to rise “given the nature of the virus.”
  The official added that the employees' absences have so far had little impact on public safety.
