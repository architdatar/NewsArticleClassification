  A total of 11,329 people, up by more than 700, have died from the coronavirus in the U.K. as of Monday. The foreign minister Dominic Raab — standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from the virus — called that number a “grizzly figure,” with more than 88,000 people infected. 
  Raab said the effectiveness of social distancing measures currently in place will be reviewed this week,  adding: "We don't expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point and we won't until we're confident, as confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made."
  Raab added that the numbers of dead and infected suggest that the U.K. is not past the peak of the epidemic yet, asking the public to continue following the government's advice to stay home.
