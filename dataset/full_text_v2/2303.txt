  The students forced to stay at home due to school closures across the U.S. can bypass standard testing for the 2019-2020 school year,Â Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced Friday.
  "Upon a proper request, the [Education] Department will grant a waiver to any state that is unable to assess its students due to the ongoing national emergency, providing relief from federally mandated testing requirements for this school year," the department said in a news release.
