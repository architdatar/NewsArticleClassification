  There are now 44 residents at the hard hit Holyoke Soldiers’ Home in Massachusetts who have died of coronavirus, and at least 100 others have tested positive, state health officials said. 
  The state-run nursing home for veterans in Holyoke, about 90 miles west of Boston, is  the subject of multiple investigations , including one by the U.S. attorney’s office in Massachusetts which is trying to determine whether residents were denied adequate medical care.
  Members of the National Guard are helping provide care for those at the facility, according to Brooke Karanovich, a spokeswoman from the state's Executive Office of Health and Human Services.
