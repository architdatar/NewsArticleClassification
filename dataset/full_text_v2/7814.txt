  Two men were arrested by authorities in Hawaii after they allegedly violated self-quarantine rules for visitors and returning residents, Gov. David Ige's office said Saturday.
  Artyon Zhiryada, 20, of Happy Valley, Oregon, and Dan Vlasenko, 19, of Vancouver, Washington, were arrested Friday as they exited a condominium in Honolulu, the office said. They arrived May 16, it said.
  The pair represents the fourth and fifth high-profile  arrests of visitors who allegedly failed to isolate  for 14 days as a pandemic precaution ordered by Ige. It was at least the third time a suspect was accused because authorities said they found  imagery of their public activity on social media .
  Zhiryada also faced an allegation of cruelty to animals after he posted a video showing him shooting a "feral" chicken with a speargun in a parking lot, the governor's office said.
