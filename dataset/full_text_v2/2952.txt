  4:09 a.m. ET, June 5, 2020 Experts fear Yemen could suffer one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks From CNN's Sam Kiley Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis face what experts fear could be one of the world's worst  coronavirus  outbreaks, raising concerns of a staggering death toll after the United Nations began cutting aid to the  war-torn nation . The cuts came after UN appeals for $2.42 billion in funding fell short by about 50% this week. "In the countdown to closure there will have to be much wider cuts to Yemen at a time when the country is now facing the growing impact of the virus pandemic on people who are already badly malnourished and ill equipped to cope with it," Lise Grande, the head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told CNN in a phone call from Sana'a on Wednesday. "General health services in 189 of the country's 369 hospitals start to close in three weeks. Water and sanitation services for 8.5 million people, including 3 million children, close in three weeks. "Nutrition support for 2.5 million malnourished starving children will start to close in eight to 10 weeks."

  3:28 a.m. ET, June 5, 2020 Hong Kong restaurant group's Covid-19 bible is sweeping the world From Kate Springer in Hong Kong With the coronavirus pandemic came a wave of mandatory physical distancing measures at restaurants around the world. Already operating on thin margins, such measures have forced  tens of thousands  of them out of business -- with many more to come. But during this global crisis, one valuable resource is now making the rounds among restaurateurs: the "Covid-19 Playbook," by  Black Sheep Restaurants . The group operates 25 establishments across Hong Kong, including Michelin-starred restaurants Belon and New Punjab Club. When co-founders Asim Hussain and Christopher Mark got wind of the highly contagious virus across the border in mainland China, the restaurateurs immediately set to work. In January, they held a leadership meeting to map out a plan, then rewrote their standard operating procedures for internal usage. But after fielding calls from concerned peers in the industry, Hussain and his team decided to publish the playbook online for anyone to reference. "We have had emails from people in Brazil in the west to Japan in the East, from India, the US, the UK, Australia ... and so far, the book's been translated into four languages," Hussain tells CNN Travel.

  2:37 a.m. ET, June 5, 2020 American billionaires have become even richer during the pandemic From CNN Business's Matt Egan The past three months have been  financially painful  for many Americans -- but not for billionaires. US billionaires have become $565 billion richer since March 18, according to a  report  published Thursday by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank. Total wealth for billionaires now stands at $3.5 trillion, up 19% from the low point near the beginning of the pandemic, the report said. Amazon ( AMZN ) boss Jeff Bezos alone is worth $36.2 billion more than he was on March 18. Since that day, nearly 43 million Americans have filed for initial unemployment benefits.  Lower-income workers,  especially in travel and service-sector jobs, have been hit particularly hard by the crisis. The numbers put an exclamation point on the deep divide between haves and have-nots that is helping to fuel unrest across the United States.  Wealth inequality  is likely to get even worse because of this crisis, experts say.

  Novavax, Inc., a Maryland-based biotech company, said Thursday it landed a major US Department of Defense contract to make its coronavirus vaccine candidate.  The Defense Department will provide up to $60 million in funding for the vaccine, which goes by the experimental name NVX-COV2373. The company will make several of the components in the US.   Novavax will deliver 10 million doses to the Department of Defense in 2020 that could be used in late-stage clinical trials or under an Emergency Use Authorization if the US Food and Drug Administration approves the vaccine. How far away is the vaccine?:  Novavax started a Phase I safety trial with volunteers in May. Those results are expected by July. If successful, Novavax will test in a larger number of patients.  Novavax is ahead of several competitors, including Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi and Merck, that are developing a vaccine but are yet started clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization.  Pharmaceutical companies Moderna and AstraZeneca have candidates in clinical trials.

  It's a common, over-the-counter drug used for treating heartburn -- yet famotidine may have given relief to patients with the novel coronavirus. Ten patients home sick with Covid-19 took famotidine, the active ingredient in Pepcid, and in all 10 cases, their symptoms improved, according to a study published Thursday. None were hospitalized, and all survived.   “All patients noticed a rapid improvement in their condition within 24 to 48 hours of starting famotidine,” according to the report, published Thursday in the medical journal Gut. “These findings suggest that famotidine may affect the course of COVID-19.”
