  Author J.K. Rowling has granted an open license to allow teachers to post videos of themselves reading aloud from "Harry Potter" books during the COVID-19 outbreak, a practice that is typically prohibited under copyright law without explicit permission from the author or publisher.Â 
  Delighted to help teachers reach kids at home by relaxing the usual licence required to post videos of themselves reading Harry Potter books. Go to  https://t.co/77d90pkiYK  to find the guidelines. Be well, everyone. More soon! ðŸ’« #HarryPotterAtHome 
  As schools have closed down in an effort to stop the spread of the pandemic, parents and teachers have looked to  the internet to keep children occupied . Entertainers, authors and teachers have started to offer craft projects, games, school classes and book readings via live streams or online videos.Â 
  Rowling has granted these rights  until the end of the school year , but teachers must only publish videos to closed educational platforms such as Google Classroom rather than public video channels such as YouTube.Â 
  Rowling joins a list of publishers to issue open licenses for read aloud videos, including Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins Childrenâ€™s Books, Penguin Random House and Scholastic.Â
