  Over the last month, the Seattle Police Department has seen a 21 percent increase in reported domestic violence cases, the department  said Wednesday , while also urging people who need help and resources to seek them. 
  Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced a  "stay home, stay healthy" order  on  March 23  that requires residents to stay home as much as possible to slow the spread of the illness caused by the new coronavirus. 
  Isolation from such orders can be devastating  for domestic abuse survivors forced to shelter somewhere unsafe, experts have warned. 
  "Life as we know it, has come to a halt, but #DomesticViolence has not," Harris County, Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez  tweeted Tuesday . He warned that there is no excuse for violence, which could escalate because of increased stress.
  The NYPD  has also warned  that survivors of domestic violence may be experiencing increased isolation and danger while at home during the pandemic and assured people that the department is there to help.
