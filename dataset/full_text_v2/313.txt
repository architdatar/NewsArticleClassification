  The number of unemployed Americans continues to climb with  another 5 million people filing jobless claims last week , bringing the total number of people applying for unemployment to 22 million in the last month.
  But an unsettling undercurrent of that number is the amount of people who are also losing access to health insurance because they lost their job. Approximately 9.2 million workers have likely lost their employer-provided health care coverage in the past four weeks, an  analysis from the Economic Policy Institute  concluded.   
  Two weeks ago, the nonprofit think tank concluded that nearly  3.5 million among the 8.7 million claims  likely lost their employer coverage .  An additional 11.4 million people have since applied for unemployment, with the biggest losses of insurance coming from the health care/social assistance, manufacturing and retail sectors.
  NBC News previously reported  that states are bracing for an increase in the number of people who have applied for Medicaid, the public health care coverage option, since the coronavirus pandemic caused states to shutter businesses and caused workers to lose access to their insurance.
