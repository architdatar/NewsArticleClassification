  9:32 p.m. ET, April 27, 2020 Trump: "No, I don't" take responsibility for spike in people using disinfectants US President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference on the novel coronavirus in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 27. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images 
  US President Donald Trump says he takes no responsibility for a spike in people using disinfectants improperly after he suggested ingesting disinfectant as a cure for coronavirus last week. When asked about the increase, Trump said, "I can't imagine why." 
  He answered, "No, I don't" when asked if he takes any responsibility for the numbers. Some context:  Trump asked his medical team to look into the possibility of using disinfectants as a way to cure the virus inside the body during a  coronavirus briefing last Thursday . He has since claimed that the comments were "sarcastic." As CNN has previously reported, Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday his state experienced hundreds of calls from people across Maryland asking whether injecting or ingesting disinfectants was an effective way to combat coronavirus. "I think it is critical that the President of the United States, when people are really scared and in the middle of this worldwide pandemic, that in these press conferences, that we really get the facts out there," he told Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation on Sunday.

  8:53 p.m. ET, April 27, 2020 "The pandemic is far from over," World Health Organization says From CNN's Amanda Watts The coronavirus pandemic isn't over, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. "The pandemic is far from over," he said at a news conference. 
  He said the WHO "continues to be concerned about the increasing trends in Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and some Asian countries." "As in all regions, cases and deaths are underreported in many countries in these regions, because of low testing capacity," Tedros said.  "This virus will not be defeated if we are not united, if we are not united, the virus will exploit the cracks between us and continue to create havoc. Lives will be lost," Tedros added.
