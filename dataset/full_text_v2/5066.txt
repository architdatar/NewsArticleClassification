  U.S. crude prices plunged to their lowest level in history as traders continue to fret over a slump in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
  West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery tanked by 92 percent, to just $1.38 per barrel, its lowest level on record. 
  With demand at near-paralysis due to social distancing lockdowns across the world, oil and fuel tanks are close to brimming. There’s little demand for gasoline from refineries, and storage tanks in the U.S. are nearing their limits.
  “The U.S. situation is quite dire,” Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ, told CNBC on Monday.
