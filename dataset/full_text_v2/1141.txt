  The country’s largest annual technology trade show, CES, is still on track to be held in Las Vegas in January, organizers said in a post on the event's website. 
  “We all face new considerations around attending conferences, conducting business and traveling to meetings,” said the Consumer Technology Association, the group behind the event. “Just as your companies are innovating to overcome the challenges this pandemic presents, we are adapting to the evolving situation.”
  The hands-on event typically draws around 175,000 people  and features innovative products and devices for attendees to try out.
  The group said it will expand its selection of livestreamed CES content and roll out new cleaning and social distancing practices. It will expand aisles in many exhibit areas and add more space between seats in conference programs.
  For 2021, attendees will be encouraged to wear masks and avoid shaking hands. 
  The event will have cashless purchase systems to limit touch points and provide enhanced on-site access to health services and medical aid.
