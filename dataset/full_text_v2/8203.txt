  Washington has joined other states in issuing a "stay home" order that urges residents to shelter in place. 
  Gov. Jay Inslee announced the order Monday, telling residents they must stay home unless they are "pursuing an essential activity." The governor also asked that people resist the urge to hoard goods during their grocery shopping, which is deemed essential under the order. 
  "If each of us maintains our normal shopping habits, we will avoid the problem of empty shelves," Inslee said.
  Nearly  2,000 cases have been confirmed  in Washington state, where 95 deaths have been blamed on the coronavirus. 
  Effective immediately, all Washingtonians must stay home unless they are pursuing an essential activity.  Those include: ➡️ Grocery shopping ➡️ Doctor appointments ➡️ Essential work duty
