  Idaho officials Friday announced the state's first case of coronavirus.
  The patient, a woman older than 50, recently returned to the southwestern part of the state after traveling to New York City for a conference, where three people reported they were positive for the virus, said state health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch.
  "Fortunately this individual is doing well," she said. "They’re at home. They’re recovering from mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization."
  Earlier in the day, the governor signed a "proactive emergency declaration."
