  At least six people have died in Louisiana due to Hurricane Laura.
  Four of the victims died from falling trees.Â According to the Louisiana Department of Health, the victims include a 14-year-old girl from Vernon Parish, a 51-year-old man from Jackson Parish, a 64-year-old woman from Allen Parish, and a 68-year-old man from Acadia Parish.
  The Calcasieu Parish coroner later confirmed two other deaths: a 24-year-old man who died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator inside his home, and a male who drowned after their boat sank.
  The death toll was expected to rise as search crews continue to check hard-hit areas.
