  8:32 p.m. ET, May 14, 2020 White House declines to have members of coronavirus task force on CNN's global town hall For the first time in 11 weeks, there will be no member of the White House's coronavirus task force on CNN's global town hall. "They have declined to allow any scientist or doctor from the task force to come on tonight. In the past as you remember, we've had Dr. (Anthony) Fauci, we've had Dr. (Deborah) Birx, Dr. (Robert) Redfield, Dr. (Stephen) Hahn, but not tonight," CNN's Sanjay Gupta said. 
  There hasn't been a full White House briefing on coronavirus in 17 days, CNN's Anderson Cooper said. Cooper added that technology is not an excuse for why no task force member could attend the town hall since "nearly all the medical staff from the task force appeared remotely in front of the Senate on Tuesday." "So their computers work. This is just the latest example of the White House trying to put as much distance between the President and this virus as possible," Cooper said. Watch:

  Health workers across Spain observed two minutes of silence in honor of all their colleagues who have died since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.  Across the country health professionals stood silently in front of hospitals, care homes and health centers in silence. On social media, videos and photos of the vigils were posted along with the hashtags #NiUnFacultativoMenos (Not one professional less) or #UnSilencioYUnaPalabra (One silence and one word). The initiative was first launched by the Medical Union Confederation (CESM) to honor the "almost 50 colleagues that have lost their lives in this fight against the coronavirus," the Union said in a statement on Thursday, "professionals who put their jobs in front of their safety and fought for the health of their patients, even above their own." 
  So far, 50,088 health workers have been infected with the virus in the country, according to Spain’s Health Ministry on Thursday. 48 doctors have died according to the General Council of Official Medical Colleges, the Spanish doctors’ professional body (CGCOM) earlier this week.

  8:24 a.m. ET, May 15, 2020 Italian prime minister critical of European Union's tourism plan From CNN’s Mia Alberti, Livia Borghese and Valentina DiDonato  Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte makes a statement to journalists in Cremona, Italy, on April 28.  Marco Mantovani/Getty Images 
  Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has criticized  the European Union's proposed tourism plan  to allow special so-called green corridors between countries within the bloc, which could see Italy cut off from summer tourist destinations.  The suggested tourism corridors would allow certain countries with low or sharply declining Covid-19 infection rates to open up to a select few destinations until borders are fully reopened. "We don’t accept bilateral agreements inside the European Union that will create privileged tourists paths," Conte said during a press conference on Wednesday.  
  "[Tourism] cannot be conditioned by bilateral agreements or we will be out of the European Union, we will never permit it”, he added, underlining that tourism represents up to 13% of Italian GDP. Conte's comments come as the EU is debating whether to permit the so-called "green corridors" or "travel bubbles” between countries according to their epidemiological situation. Conte said he has told the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, that these "corridors" would mean the "destruction" of the EU's single market. The  losses on the Italian tourism sector  due to the coronavirus could be around 120 billion euros ($130 billion) until the end of the year, according to the Italian Confederation of Enterprises 'Confcommercio'. Up to 420,000 jobs and 270,000 businesses in trade and tourism are also at risk. The Italian government has allocated 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) to support the tourism and culture sector in its 55 billion euro ($60 billion) stimulus package to help the country recover from the economic hit of coronavirus crisis. This includes tax cuts for business owners, a 500€ ($540) vacation bonus for families with an income under 40,000 euros to travel inside of Italy, and extending hotel vouchers valid from 12 to 18 months, the Minister of Tourism, Dario Francheschini announced on Thursday. CLARIFICATION: This post has been updated to indicate Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was critical of the European Union's plan, which could allow special so-called green corridors.

  12:12 p.m. ET, May 14, 2020 Coronavirus may have killed over 22,000 in care homes in England and Wales, study says From CNN’s Max Ramsay in London  There have been more than 22,000 excess deaths among care home residents in England and Wales as a direct or indirect result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to  a new report from London School of Economics (LSE) academics . This is more than double official figures for Covid-19 deaths among care home residents.  The study, published on Tuesday by two academics at LSE’s Care Policy and Evaluation Centre, found that by May 1 there had been “in excess of 22,000 deaths of care home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic” in England and Wales, which is 54% of all excess deaths.  This calculation was based on the total excess mortality in care homes of 19,038, and adjusted by 15%, based on an assumption from Care Quality Commission data that 15% of all deaths of care home residents are found to happen in hospitals.  The study found official data on deaths in care homes directly attributed to coronavirus underestimates the impact of the pandemic, as it does “not take account of indirect mortality effects of the pandemic and/or because of problems with the identification of the disease as the cause of death”.  The UK’s Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday that 8,314 deaths involving Covid-19 had taken place in care homes up to May 8 in England alone. On May 8, UK Department of Health figures reported there had been 31,241 total deaths from coronavirus in hospitals in the UK.  The  Office for National Statistics noted  that deaths among care home residents was in recent days becoming a larger proportion of total deaths, with 40% of coronavirus deaths occurring in care homes in the “most recent days” up to Tuesday.
