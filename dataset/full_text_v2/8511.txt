  Russell Yale, a Wisconsin voter residing in the Milwaukee suburbs, spoke to NBC News on Thursday about not receiving the absentee ballots he and his wife requested as  reports detail hundreds of ballots  in the state were  never distributed  to voters ahead of Tuesday's primary and down-ballot elections.
  Yale said he and his wife, both over 70, requested the ballots in light of the public health crisis gripping the country and said he feels "disenfranchised" now that he is unable to vote, adding that there "needs" to be "a post-mortem" to learn what went wrong. Yale said he wanted to vote in the Democratic presidential primary and in a key race for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat.
  "I just don't want this to happen again," Yale said, pointing to November's election. "I just don't want anything to keep my vote from counting."
  Those Wisconsin voters who defied the state's stay-at-home order to vote on Tuesday  braved extensive lines  and hourslong waits after  two courts ruled that the primary election couldn't be postponed . State Democrats sought to delay the contest  but failed .
