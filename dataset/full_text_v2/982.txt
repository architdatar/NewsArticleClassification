  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said he is signing an executive order that requires all riders on NJ Transit buses and trains and on private bus lines to wear a mask or face covering. 
  The order also says transit operators must provide their workers with masks and gloves.
  "For many of our essential workers, public transit is how they get to work and we need to protect them during that trip," the governor said at a press conference on Saturday. 
  In addition, Murphy said he was reducing the capacity on all buses, trains and rails by 50 percent. 
  The governor previously said that all residents must wear a face covering when inside a grocery store or supermarket. On Saturday, he extended that to include restaurants and bars when residents go inside to pick up takeout orders. 
  The new orders go into effect Monday at 8 p.m.
