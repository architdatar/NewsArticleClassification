  The captain relieved of command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt after warning of an outbreak of the  coronavirus  on his ship has tested positive for the virus, a U.S. defense official told Fox News on Sunday.
  The Navy ousted Capt.  Brett Crozier , 50, after he authored a letter warning that the outbreak of the sometimes-deadly virus had created a dire situation on the carrier.
  The letter ended up in the hands of a San Francisco Chronicle reporter who first reported its contents last week.

  Crozier had started showing COVID-19 symptoms before he was removed from the warship last Thursday, The New York Times first reported, citing two Naval Academy classmates of Crozier's close to him and his family.
  Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly ordered Crozier to step down, citing a failure to follow the Navy's chain of command. He accused Crozier of inciting “panic” with the letter.

  This past Saturday, President Trump said at the White House coronavirus briefing that he backed Modly’s decision.
