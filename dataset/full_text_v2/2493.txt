Over the weekend, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the virus was “under control” in Cuba and the government would soon announce measures to gradually reopen the island.  Since the outbreak, Cuban officials have ended nearly all international travel to and from the island, made wearing a face mask in public mandatory and have required everyone ill with the coronavirus to quarantine at government-run hospitals. Cuba has a total of 2,200 cases of coronavirus and a total of 83 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said he and family members took part in  two protests  this weekend, and plans to soon be tested for coronavirus. “To say that black lives matter, that systemic racism must be relegated to history, and we must use this time to transform our society and ourselves so that we finally live up to our nation’s highest ideals," he said. The governor said he was “honored” to walk alongside community leaders and residents in Hillside, and urged those protesting across the state to be tested for coronavirus. “To everyone who took to their streets and town centers, please go out and get tested for Covid-19. We cannot let what happened across New Jersey this weekend be undone by an outbreak," he said. 
  Murphy said he and the first lady of New Jersey have scheduled their tests.

  3:45 p.m. ET, June 8, 2020 Miami-Dade will reopen beaches no later than Wednesday From CNN’s Kay Jones  Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images 
  Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said that the county will open its beaches no later than Wednesday. Speaking to reporters at the National Hurricane Center Monday, he said there is a good possibility that the curfew will be lifted tonight, and that they need a little time to prepare to open the beaches.  Beaches were closed in March and were expected to open today. However, the closure was extended due to the curfew implemented May 30 during the protests over the death of George Floyd.

  2:10 p.m. ET, June 8, 2020 Canada relaxes some border restrictions, but 14-day quarantine is still required From CNN’s Paula Newton in Ottawa  CTV Network 
  Canada announced Monday that it would relax some border restrictions for immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents, including some who have been trying to enter from the United States. Despite the change, a 14-day mandatory quarantine for anyone entering the country remains in place.  "If you don't follow these rules, you could face serious penalties," Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa.  
  Trudeau acknowledged that this has been a hard time for some families kept apart because of the pandemic.  "This is an incredibly difficult time to be apart from a spouse, a child, or mom or dad," Trudeau said.  Nonessential travel into Canada is currently restricted, and that includes travel across the US-Canada border.  That mutual border agreement is set to expire June 21 but Trudeau has indicated that "stronger measures" to contain the virus might be needed even if the border reopens to discretionary travel.

  1:52 p.m. ET, June 8, 2020 Covid-19 has triggered the deepest recession in decades From CNN's Alison Kosik The World Bank predicts global economic growth this year will shrink the most since World War II due to the coronavirus pandemic. Economists at the World Bank say Covid-19 has  triggered the deepest recession in decades . They expect the global economy in 2020 to shrink 5.2% — nearly three times as steep as the global recession in 2009. “This is a deeply sobering outlook, with the crisis likely to leave long-lasting scars and pose major global challenges,” said World Bank Group vice president Ceyla Pazarbasioglu. 
  In its more than 200-page report on the global economy, the World Bank said it envisions a moderate recovery of 4.2% in 2021. However, it also said an “even worst scenario is possible” if the health crisis takes longer than expected to bring under control. The World Bank also said the pandemic is taking a heavy human and economic toll on the poorest countries, and that “those already in extreme poverty could descend further into destitution.”

  1:48 p.m. ET, June 8, 2020 The US coronavirus recession began in February From CNN’s Matt Egan  Joe Raedle/Getty Images 
  The National Bureau of Economic Research  declared  Monday that the coronavirus recession began in February. The economy collapsed so rapidly that NBER wasted no time in announcing a recession, a stark contrast to previous downturns when the body took a year to declare what most people already knew. Social distancing requirements imposed to fight the pandemic have crushed broad swaths of the US economy, from airlines and cruise ships to restaurants and Broadway shows. "The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions," NBER  wrote . 
  More than 42 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. Major companies including JCPenney, J.Crew and Hertz have filed for bankruptcy. And economists are predicting GDP imploded at an annualized rate of 40% during the second quarter. The pandemic marked an end to the mediocre but long recovery from the Great Recession. In July 2019, that expansion officially became the longest period of uninterrupted growth in US history dating back to 1854. It spanned 128 months, easily breaking the prior record of 120 months set between March 1991 and March 2001 during the dotcom boom.

  1:05 p.m. ET, June 8, 2020 Coronavirus is in retreat across the UK, health secretary says From CNN’s Sarah Dean in London Coronavirus is in retreat across the United Kingdom, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday. He said the government's scientific advisers estimate the virus reproductive rate is currently below one in all regions. However, Hancock warned that where there are individual “flare ups and outbreaks” the government will take local action. "The good news is that while this is clearly not over there is progress," Hancock said at a daily Downing Street news conference. "We are taking a safety first approach," he added. 
  "The epidemic in care homes is coming under control... the latest figures shows an almost 50% fall in the number of new care homes reporting an outbreak," Hancock said. No Covid-19-related deaths were recorded in London hospitals or across Scotland on Sunday, he said.  However, although Sunday's official UK death toll of 55 was the lowest daily rise since lockdown began on March 23, the figures do tend to be lower at weekends because of delays in reporting, Hancock cautioned.

  12:36 p.m. ET, June 8, 2020 24 children test positive for coronavirus in new Vermont outbreak  From CNN's Carma Hassan Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said more than 1,000 people have turned out for testing after they first reported an outbreak in Winooski Friday. As of last night, there are a total of 62 cases that are believed to be associated with the outbreak — 48 Winooski residents, nine Burlington residents, and five people from other towns in Chittendon County tested positive for coronavirus, Levine said. Of the cases, 38 are adults and 24 are children, Levine said. “The age range is from 1 to 64 with a median age of 21,” Levine said, adding that there have no reports of hospitalizations and no deaths associated with this outbreak. The state is experiencing an overall uptick in cases but the positivity rate remains low, Levine said. There are 1,075 cases of coronavirus in Vermont, at least 895 people have recovered, and the death total, which hasn’t changed in several weeks, is 55.  The health department epidemiology team is working to determine whether the cases in Burlington are linked to the Winooski cases, or if there is the possibility of unrelated transmission in Burlington. They will continue to offer testing every day in Winooski and Burlington and Levine says he expects the number of cases to rise over the coming days. Levine said that many of the people who tested positive did not know they were affected and about one in five people reported they have symptoms. This could be because they were told very early on and haven’t had symptoms yet or it could mean they are asymptomatic, Levine said.  “Let me now reassure everyone, no matter who you are or where you live, you can still walk the streets of Winooski and Burlington, or any other community in Vermont, but please continue to take the same precautions we have been advising all along,” Levine said. “Wear a facial covering, keep a six-foot distance from others, wash your hands a lot, and of course if you are feeling ill, stay home.”
