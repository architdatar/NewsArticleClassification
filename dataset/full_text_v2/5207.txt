  Paris's Eiffel Tower, one of the most iconic landmarks on the planet, will reopen to the public on June 25.
  "At first, only visits by stairs will be available and masks will be mandatory for all our visitors from 11 years old," officials said in a news release Tuesday.
  "As the situation evolves, the lifts taking our visitors to the second floor can be quickly put back into service under appropriate conditions, with a very limited number of persons on-board," officials added.
  "The top level remains closed for now to avoid promiscuity situations, since the lifts taking visitors from second to top floor are small. It might re-open during the summer."
