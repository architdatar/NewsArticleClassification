  Former  President Barack Obama  tweeted Wednesday that current social distancing policies need to stay in place until testing for the novel coronavirus is more widespread.
  Obama's tweet comes as President Donald Trump has pushed in recent days for the U.S. economy to begin ramping up by Easter.
  These are the burdens our medical heroes already face in NYC. It's only going to get harder across the country. Another reason to maintain social distancing policies at least until we have comprehensive testing in place. Not just for our sake—for theirs.  https://t.co/bwNXhOPMYs 
  "These are the burdens our medical heroes already face in NYC," Obama  tweeted , linking to a New Yorker magazine story detailing the struggles from inside New York City's stressed hospitals. "It's only going to get harder across the country. Another reason to maintain social distancing policies at least until we have comprehensive testing in place. Not just for our sake — for theirs."
  In recent weeks,  Obama has made use of his large social media platforms  to address the coronavirus pandemic, posting like never before since leaving office. The former president has posted messages promoting safety measures, explained the reasoning behind strong new restrictions to combat the virus and shared stories he finds inspiring of individuals and organizations taking action during the crisis.
