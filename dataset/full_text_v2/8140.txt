  A heartwarming  video  shows employees at a New Jersey hospital cheering on a colleague after he recovered from COVID-19.
  The  video , recorded Wednesday inside  St. Joseph Regional Medical Center  in Paterson, shows hospital staffers clapping and holding signs for Dr. James Pruden, the hospital's director of emergency preparedness, with the theme song from the movie “Rocky,” "Gonna Fly Now," playing in the background.
  In a statement to NBC News released by the hospital, Dr. Pruden thanked his colleagues and healthcare workers for their support. 
  “Your care made the difference for me and enabled me to beat this virus,” Dr. Pruden said. “I implore every healthcare worker across New Jersey to keep the faith and stay strong. You are giving everything – for people just like me. You are truly our heroes.”
