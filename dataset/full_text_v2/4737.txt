  Nevadans could return to bars as soon as Friday, the governor said Tuesday in announcing the state's move into the next phase of reopening its economy.
  Casinos, gaming operations, brothels, adult entertainment businesses and nightclubs will still be closed. Gov. Steve Sisolak said in prepared remarks that reopening of gambling is eyed for July 4, although there will be restrictions.
  "Our collective actions have helped bring us to where we are today," Sisolak said.
  Restaurants and bars will generally be limited to 50 percent occupancy or less with strict social distancing. Patrons won't be able to walk up to bars and order, but can be served while seated at bar tops if spaced apart.Â Places like pools, art galleries, museums, gyms and movie theaters also have occupancy limits.
  Houses of worship can have in-person services of up to 50 people. But the governor "strongly" urged residents to use virtual services.
  Sisolak had planned to announce the changes at a press conference, but he is quarantined after  possibly being exposed  to COVID-19. He said he has no symptoms and will be tested Wednesday.
  So, please, put on your face covering when you leave your house. Help protect your fellow Nevadans. Wear your face covering like a badge of honor.  Thank you!
