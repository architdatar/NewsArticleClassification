  Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II will head to Windsor Castle on Thursday, a week earlier than planned, Buckingham Palace said Tuesday.
  She will, however, still meet with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and has two other planned "audiences" at Buckingham Palace, as planned before her departure.
  “In consultation with the Medical Household and Government, a number of public events with large numbers of people due to have been attended by The Queen, and other Members of the Royal Family, in the coming months will be cancelled or postponed,” the palace said in the statement.
  Three garden parties scheduled to take place in May were also canceled, along with Maundy Service at St George’s Chapel. It’s likely that the queen will stay at Windsor Castle beyond Easter, the palace said.
