  The Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman — which is under  federal investigation  over alleged civil rights abuses — has reported its first death of an inmate who had the coronavirus.
  The results of his test did not come in until after his death, state corrections officials said Monday. Other details were not immediately available, but the officials added that he had been exhibiting symptoms and was medically isolated before he died. The exact cause of death was unavailable.
  Tommy Taylor, the interim commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, said in a statement that the state's prisons have been under quarantine since the coronavirus outbreak began. "With this first positive case, we have further isolated all the affected areas and increased screenings for all the inmates who came in contact with the individual," Taylor added.
  It's unclear if other prisoners are now being tested. Prisoner rights advocates have  asked for more transparency  from the state and say the poor conditions at Parchman make it susceptible to the virus' spread.
