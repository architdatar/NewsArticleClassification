  Virginians will soon be required to wear face coverings "inside at a public place," Gov. Ralph Northam said Tuesday. 
  The new rule goes into effect on Friday and includes a "store, a barbershop, a restaurant, on public transportation, at a government building or anywhere where people can congregate in groups."
  The only exception will be for people with a health condition that prevents them from wearing a mask, children under the age of 10, or if a person is eating or exercising. 
  Northam also addressed photos that showed him not wearing a mask while visiting Virginia Beach over the weekend. The governor said he was there to speak to the mayor, thank first responders and answer media questions. 
  He said he was caught off guard when people asked to take photos with him. "In the future, when I'm out in the public, I will be better prepared," Northam said. "We're all forming new habits and routines and we're all adjusting to this new normal.”
