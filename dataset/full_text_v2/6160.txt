  A Texas zoo is giving families an opportunity to see animals while also practicing social distancing. 
  Beginning May 1st, visitors to the San Antonio Zoo will be able to enjoy the sights and sounds, all from the comfort and safety of their vehicles. The  drive-thru zoo  experience is expected to last between 30 minutes and an hour and includes an  audio tour , which is posted on the zoo’s website.
  "This is a very unique and safe way for families to see the zoo while we are closed from the comfort of their own car," said Tim Morrow, President & CEO San Antonio Zoo, according to  NBC affiliate WOAI . 
  The zoo has been closed since March 14 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Proceeds from the drive-thru experience will help the zoo to continue to care for the animals until it is safe to reopen, according to Murrow.
  This weekend  @SanAntonioZoo  will launch Drive-Thru Zoo, a one-of-a-kind experience where families can get the chance to see the zoo while we are closed from the comfort, safety, and security of their own vehicle.  #DriveThruZoo   #SAZoo   https://t.co/1VelXlKssw   pic.twitter.com/HNwneUm85w
