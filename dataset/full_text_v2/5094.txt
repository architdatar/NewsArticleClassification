At one point during yesterday's White House press conference, a reporter asked Donald Trump for his expectations on the U.S. death toll by the summer. For a moment, I thought the president might add yet another prediction to  his unfortunate series .
  Fortunately, he did not. "You know what?" Trump  replied . "I don't want to think about it, even."
  But the president has given U.S. fatalities at least  some  thought. In fact, at the same event, Trump  boasted , "I think one of the things we're most proud of is -- this just came out -- deaths per 100,000 people, death -- so deaths per 100,000 people: Germany and the United States are at the lowest rung of that ladder.... Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people, which, frankly, to me, that's perhaps the most important number there is."
  This was not a slip of the tongue: Trump made the identical claim twice yesterday, suggesting it's become a key White House talking point.
  It is, however, spectacularly wrong. A  Washington Post   analysis  said this might be the single "wrongest thing Trump has said about coronavirus."
  As the  Post 's report  added , putting the United States next to Germany "is ridiculous; Germany has about nine deaths per 100,000 people, as compared with about 24 per 100,000 people in the United States."
  All things considered, this represents either the latest instance in which the president had no idea what he was talking about, or the latest instance in which Trump peddled demonstrable nonsense with the hopes that the public wouldn't know the difference.
