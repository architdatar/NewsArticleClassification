President Donald Trump said Monday that Americans could be hunkered down and practicing social distancing at least until July or August to confront the coronavirus pandemic. Trump  announced a list of new guidelines.  
  During a White House briefing, Trump was asked whether the administration had any estimate of how quickly the country would “turn this corner.” Many Americans have been working from home, and states are increasingly closing schools, businesses and prohibiting large gatherings of people.
  “People are talking about July, August – or something like that,” Trump told reporters, who were spaced in every other seat in the White House briefing room to practice distancing.
