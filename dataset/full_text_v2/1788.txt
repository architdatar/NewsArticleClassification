  1:06 p.m. ET, March 12, 2020 Coronavirus cases in 30 states have been linked to Europe, CDC says Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said cases in 30 or more states were linked to cases in Europe. During a House Oversight Committee hearing Thursday discussing the coronavirus response, Redfield said the "real risk in general right now, and this is why the President took the action he did last night, within the world now, over 70% of the new cases are linked to Europe. In the United States … 30 states or more were linked actually to cases in Europe."  Redfield reiterated, “Europe is the new China.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said as the CDC recently investigated the 35 states that were reporting cases, 30 of them “who were more recently getting infections ... That was predominately from Italy and from France and from Germany.”

  12:56 p.m. ET, March 12, 2020 These federal agencies want blood donations to continue From CNN's Mallory Simon Two federal agencies are urging people in the United States to continue donating blood during the coronavirus pandemic. The US Department of Health and Human Services, the US Food and Drug Administration and US blood banks are urging blood donations and trying to calm fears. They said in a statement that coronavirus does not pose any known risks to blood donors during the donation process. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Americans need to “start turning out in force to give blood.” The push comes as blood centers are seeing cancellation of drives and significant drops in donations. The American Red Cross said 300 Red Cross blood drives in the United States have been canceled because of coronavirus concerns. That translates to about 8,000 uncollected blood donations, the group said.   The FDA and HHS said the cancellation of blood drives means they are unable to keep the blood supply adequately replenished. “We need people to prevent the blood supply from getting depleted. We need it not to get to the point that surgeries are having to get canceled,” Marks said. “That’s something we absolutely do not want to have happen. To ensure an adequate blood supply we need people to come out and donate blood.” 
  The FDA said there “have been no reported or suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus and the virus poses no known risk to patients receiving blood transfusions.” “It is safe to donate blood,” said Admiral Dr. Brett P. Giroir, assistant secretary for HHS. “Part of preparedness includes a robust blood supply. Healthy individuals should schedule an appointment to donate today to ensure that blood is available for those patients who need it.” Kate Fry, chief executive of America’s Blood Centers, which collects close to 60% of the nation’s blood supply, urged people to donate before things get worse. “Blood donors are needed now more than ever. We cannot wait for the situation to intensify further before taking action,” Fry said. “The blood supply cannot be taken for granted and the coronavirus only heightens the need for a ready blood supply.”

  Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the cost of testing and treatment will be covered. During Thursday’s House Oversight committee hearing on novel coronavirus, Rep. Ayanna Pressley asked Redfield, "will the cost of testing be covered,” Redfield responded, "the cost of testing will be covered.” Following up, Pressley asked, "and what about treatment?" Redfield said, "cost of treatment will be covered." Redfield said the White House Coronavirus Task Force is working hard to make sure everyone is financially able to stay home if necessary during the coronavirus outbreak.   He said the task force has "addressed this as a critical public health component,” adding the United States needs to ensure those under a 14-day quarantine “not have to sneak out for an hourly job so they have to pay for their cost of living."

Follow all the rules, stay home and everything will work out.” The news comes after 25-year-old Juventus defender Daniele Rugani announced on Wednesday that he had contracted the virus – the first player in Serie A to do so.
