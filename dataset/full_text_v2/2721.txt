  One of the largest independent domain marketplaces announced Thursday it would remove coronavirus-related domain names and no longer allow sellers to list them for sale.
  “We’re seeing astronomical high prices being asked for these domains and find that unethical and unacceptable,” the company,  DAN.com , said in  a series of tweets  Thursday morning. 
  The number of coronavirus-related domains have grown astronomically to more than 68,000 this year,  according to DomainTools , a cyber intelligence company that tracks such registrations. Many of those carry spam, phishing attempts or malware, DomainTools’ vice president of product Jackie Abrams wrote in a blog post this week. 
  DAN encouraged their clients that own coronavirus domains to donate them to charities, government agencies or non-profits.
