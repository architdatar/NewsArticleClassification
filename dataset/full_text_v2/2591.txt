  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that in May, the city will begin producing 50,000 of its own tests kits each week. 
  That will be in addition to the 50,000 test kits supplied to the city on a weekly basis by Aria Diagnostics in Indiana, he said. 
  "For the first time, we're going to have a truly, reliable, major supply of testing," de Blasio said. 
  He called on the federal government to provide more tests kits and personal protective equipment.
  "This does not let the federal government off the hook," he said.
