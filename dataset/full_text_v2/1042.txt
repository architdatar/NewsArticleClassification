  California Gov. Gavin Newsom has temporarily suspended parts of a state law that bans single-use carryout bags at places like grocery stores, citing the coronavirus epidemic.
  The law  says that retailers can give out thicker, reusable plastic bags or recycled paper bags with a 10-cent fee. Proponents said the law would reduce plastic pollution.
  But Newsom wrote in  the executive order  signed Thursday that handling reusable bags from customers' homes could place workers at greater risk of contracting the coronavirus.
  The order suspends parts of the law for 60 days and allows retailers to give out reusable bags for free or to give out single-use bags. It doesn't affect cities that have their own plastic-bag bans in effect before 2015.
  Some grocery stores have already required that people who bring reusable bags fill them themselves, and some have banned reusable bags, according to the California Grocers Association's  website  about the virus and stores' responses.
  Maine in March  delayed implementation  of that state's plastic-bag ban until January of 2021 in a package of measures designed to respond to the coronavirus epidemic. New Hampshire's governor in  a March 21 order  required grocers to provide single-use paper or plastic bags, citing the potential risk of transmission from reusable bags brought from home.
