  Joe Biden called President Donald Trump "an absolute fool" for criticizing the former vice president for  wearing a face mask  during a Memorial Day remembrance. 
  "He's a fool, an absolute fool to talk that way. Every leading doc in the world is saying you should wear a mask when you're in a crowd," Biden said in a CNN appearance on Tuesday, adding that Trump is trying to act "macho."
  Biden also changed his profile picture on Twitter to one of him wearing the same mask he donned during the services. 
  Trump, who did not wear a mask during Memorial Day services, retweeted Fox News commentator Brit Hume's Monday night tweet criticizing Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, for wearing one. Monday’s appearance was Biden’s first public one since mid-March. He appeared wearing a black mask covering most of his face and a pair of aviator sunglasses with his wife, Jill Biden, who also wore a mask.
  Trump denied mocking Biden at a Tuesday news conference. 
  "Biden can wear a mask," Trump added, saying it was "unusual" since Biden does not wear one indoors. However, the administration's guidelines recommend wearing a mask outdoors.
