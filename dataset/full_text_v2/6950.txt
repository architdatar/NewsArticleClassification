  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday asked President Donald Trump if  the Comfort, a 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship  now docked in New York City, could be shifted to take patients suffering from COVID-19, the disease associated with coronavirus.
  The ship, brought to New York City to free up much-needed hospital space for infected patients, had  previously been reserved  for non-virus patients. The Comfort had only 20 patients as of Thursday night. 
  "As it turned out, there's not a lot of non-COVID people in the hospital system, which is a separate story," Cuomo said. "A byproduct of shutting everything down is you have fewer car accidents, crime rate is way down, fewer trauma cases, so there is not a large non-COVID population in the hospitals." 
  Cuomo said later Monday on MSNBC that Trump agreed to the request. The governor said the move adds 1,000 beds to the fight against the disease, which will hopefully alleviate some of the stress on the state's healthcare system.
  Cuomo also said schools and non-essential businesses would remain closed through at least April 29 and that the fine for those who violated restrictions on social distancing would increase, from $500 to $1,000.
