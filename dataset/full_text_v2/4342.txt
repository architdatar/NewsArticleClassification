Lysol warned people not to inject or ingest its products as a coronavirus treatment a day after  President Donald Trump speculated  on disinfectants when discussing possible cures for COVID-19. 
  Lysol issued a statement on its website Friday titled "Improper Use of Disinfectants." The notice said parent company Reckitt Benckiser Group was asked whether disinfectants are safe to use as a treatment for the respiratory virus. 
  "We must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route)," Lysol said in a statement. "As with all products, our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines."
  If you have any questions on how to best use the company's products, you can refer to the label and safety information on the bottle.

  At a White House coronavirus briefing Thursday, Trump raised the possibility of a cure after discussing ultraviolet light treatment options for people who contract the respiratory illness. 
  The president questioned whether people could be treated with "a very powerful light." Then he brought up disinfectants but didn't specify a particular brand. 
  "I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute," Trump said. "And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs, it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that."
  In response, Bill Bryan, an undersecretary of science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, said Trump's suggestions weren't possible. "We don't do that within that lab, at our labs," Bryan said.
  Trump replied, "Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't work."
