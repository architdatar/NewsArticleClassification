  Haircuts, massages and shopping for garden supplies topped the agenda for Swiss on Monday as the country slowly started easing restrictions on public life imposed in March to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
  Queues formed in front of garden centers as people battling cabin fever emerged from six weeks of staying at home at the government's urging.
  More than 1,300 people in Switzerland have died from the coronavirus so far, with the number of confirmed cases now over 29,000.
