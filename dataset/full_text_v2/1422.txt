  A cruise on the Nile river has been quarantined by Egyptian health authorities after 12 people tested positive for coronavirus. 
  A Taiwanese-American tourist likely caused the spread on board the ship, as she tested positive for the virus after returning to Taiwan late in February, officials said.
  They added that American, French and Indian nationals were among the 150 passengers and crew on board. 
  Those confirmed to be infected with the respiratory had been isolated on board, officials said, adding that the remaining passengers and crew were awaiting their test results.
