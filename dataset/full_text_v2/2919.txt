  Deaths from  coronavirus  in England and Wales in nursing homes and hospices may be higher than previous figures have suggested, data from the  Office for National Statistics  showed on Tuesday. 
  England and Wales reported 16,387 deaths in the week ending April 3, according to official data, 15 percent higher than previously recorded. Although 90 percent of coronavirus deaths occurred in hospitals, about 10 percent of people died in nursing homes and hospices, the report found.
  Data collected from other European countries including Spain, France and Belgium, by the  London School of Economics , also appeared to show that around half of coronavirus deaths were happening in nursing homes, sparking concern that such deaths are being left out of official death tolls.
