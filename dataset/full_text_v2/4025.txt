  What you need to know Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading infectious disease expert in the US, has  warned  that if the country allows coronavirus infections to run rampant to achieve possible herd immunity, the death toll would be massive, especially among vulnerable people.

  An advisor to President Donald Trump on coronavirus has said that “young people are not at risk for serious disease” from Covid-19.   Dr. Scott Atlas made the comments to Martha MacCallum Thursday night on Fox News. Fact check:  Adults are more likely to become seriously ill from Covid-19, but children can get sick, and have serious complications.  Rare complications:  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported at least 570 cases of children with MIS-C, a rare but serious coronavirus complication in children that has been associated with fever, rash, inflammation and shock. Ten of those children died. Increased virus rates in kids : There has been a 90% increase in the number of Covid-19 cases among children in the United States over the last four weeks, according to an analysis by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association released this week.  “It's not fair to say that this virus is completely benign in children," said Dr. Sean O'Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, noting that about 90 children have died in the US from coronavirus.

  11:38 p.m. ET, August 13, 2020 Fauci says consequences could be "devastating" if the country reopens without the virus under control From CNN’s Lauren Mascarenhas Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on July 31, in Washington, DC.

  America needs to get control of Covid-19 and carefully reopen the country, or the consequences could be devastating, Dr. Anthony Fauci told actor Matthew McConaughey in an interview on Instagram Thursday. “To think that you can ignore the biologic and get the economy back, it's not gonna happen,” said Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious diseases expert. “It's just not gonna happen. You gotta do both. You gotta get control of the biologic as you carefully, open the country.”  
  Fauci emphasized the importance of acting in a measured, prudent way. He noted that we have seen the consequences of jumping over the guideposts that have been established for safe reopening. “It goes beyond the economics,” said Fauci. “If you shut down, even if there was no economic issue, what happens is that psychologically, it could be devastating."  “If you're really shut down, children may not get their vaccinations. People don't go to hospitals when they get chest pain,” he added. “There's a lot of different things that could go wrong, beyond the economy.” Fauci gave another grim warning. “In fact, there's projections that if you stay shut down, the number of deaths unrelated to Covid will go up,” he said. “The number of suicides, overdoses, family issues, such as child abuse and things like that, they all go up.” Fauci said that he believes the country can come together to overcome the virus. “I'm old enough to have been a baby during World War II, but I remember how the country absolutely pulled together. We pulled together after 9/11. This is equivalent to that,” he said. “We've got to pull together.”
