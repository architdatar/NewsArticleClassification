  President Donald Trump on Thursday once again urged governors to purchase critical medical supplies needed to help combat the coronavirus pandemic — like face masks — themselves, instead of only relying on the federal government to supply them.
  On a lengthy conference call with multiple U.S. governors at the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington, D.C., Trump was told by Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker that his state had tried to put in “three big orders” of masks “but lost” them to the federal government. Baker asked how states could best take advantage of the Defense Production Act —  a 1950 law the president invoked on Wednesday  that allows him to force American businesses to produce materials in the national defense, such as ventilators and medical supplies for health care workers.
  Trump replied that “we like you going out and seeing if you can get it faster.” The president has in recent days repeatedly advised governors  to try to acquire medical supplies themselves .
  Vice President Mike Pence added that he would advise governors to “reach out to construction companies” for the masks, because “they’re in possession of a lot.”
