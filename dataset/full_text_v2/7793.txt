  Three states are holding Democratic primaries Tuesday -— the first since the  coronavirus  was declared a  pandemic  and a  national emergency , paralyzing much of the country with shutdowns.
  There were initially four states slated to vote, but Ohio's primary was called off Monday night after Gov. Mike DeWine  filed suit to block it , citing concerns that poll workers could be exposed to the virus.
  The St. Patrick's Day primaries are also the first since Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders faced off in a  stripped down, one-on-one debate  in Washington, D.C., on Sunday night.
  Sanders faces an uphill battle in Tuesday's states — Hillary Clinton  won all three  while running against him in 2016, and won Ohio as well.  Polling shows a possible Biden sweep. 
  Here's a look at  what you need to know.
