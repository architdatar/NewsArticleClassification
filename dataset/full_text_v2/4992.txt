  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday responded to criticism he singled out the Orthodox Jewish community on Tuesday after personally overseeing the dispersal of a crowd of hundreds of mourners at a Hasidic funeral in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.
  "I spoke out of real distress that people's lives were in danger before my eyes and I was not going to tolerate it. So I regret if the way I said it in any way gave people a feeling of being treated the wrong way. That was not my intention," de Blasio said at a news briefing. "It was said with love, but it was tough love. It was anger and frustration.
  He also dismissed comparisons of the funeral Tuesday night, which he and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said drew thousands of people, to crowds that gathered earlier Tuesday to watch a flyover by the Navy's Blue Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds to honor health care workers.
  "What I saw, no, it has not happened other places. Let's be honest," de Blasio said. "This kind of gathering has happened in only a few places. And it cannot continue. It's endangering the lives of people in the community. It cannot happen."
  The mayor said he loves and has worked closely with New York's Orthodox Hasidic communities.
  De Blasio  lashed out at mourners late Tuesday night  who had gathered for the funeral of a rabbi who died of the coronavirus.
  The mayor faced swift backlash for a series of tweets in which he denounced the gathering.
  "My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed," he  tweeted . "I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about stopping this disease and saving lives. Period."
  Images  posted on social media  show hundreds of people — some wearing face coverings — tightly packed on the street.
