  The state of Indiana has recorded its first coronavirus-related death on Monday, according to the state's health department. 
  An adult over the age of 60 died Monday morning at a Community Health Network hospital after being hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease associated with coronavirus. The unidentified patient had an underlying medical condition, though the health department did not say what that was.
  Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb encouraged state residents to stay home and follow the precautionary measures laid out by the state. 
  “A family today is suffering the ultimate loss due to COVID-19, and this sadly underscores how severe the virus can be — especially for some high-risk Hoosiers," Holcomb said on Monday. 
  The death of the Indiana patient brings the U.S. death toll to 71.
