  Britain’s coronavirus death toll rose by 888 to 15,464 on Saturday, the U.K.’s health ministry said.
  Of the more than 350,000 people in the country who've been tested for COVID-19, 114,217 tested positive.
  Britain recently extended its nationwide lockdown measures for at least three more weeks due to concerns that relaxing the rules could cause a "second peak" which could "substantially" increase the number of deaths, Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Thursday.
