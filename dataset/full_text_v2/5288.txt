  Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary Katie Miller returned to work Tuesday after three negative coronavirus tests, Miller announced on Twitter.
  Miller was the  second White House staff member  known to have tested positive for the coronavirus earlier this month. 
  "Thank you to all my amazing doctors and everyone who reached out with support," Miller said. "I couldn't have done it without my amazing husband who took great care of his pregnant wife."
