  America’s ambassador to Albania warned U.S. citizens in the country on Tuesday that the last chartered flight out of the capital, Tirana, would leave the next day on April 1. 
  “If you wish to be on that flight, if you are not prepared to remain in Albania for the indefinite future, please contact us immediately so we can help you,” Ambassador Yuri Kim said in  a video message posted on the embassy’s official Twitter account.  
  Kim said there were no more commercial flights departing Tirana.
  It was not immediately clear who had chartered the flight or its exact destination.
