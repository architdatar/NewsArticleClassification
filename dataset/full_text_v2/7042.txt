  What you need to know The  novel coronavirus  may have circulated in the US  as early as December , about a month earlier than believed by the CDC, according to researchers with UCLA. India has topped 5 million Covid-19 cases after reporting 1 million new infections in just 11 days. Only  the US  has recorded more cases. It might not be until 2022 when the world can begin thinking about returning to "pre-Covid" life, WHO's chief scientist said.

  6:45 p.m. ET, September 16, 2020 Trump claims Redfield was "confused" in earlier vaccine testimony From CNN's Allie Malloy and Jason Hoffman  President Donald Trump speaks to the press during a news conference in the White House on Wednesday in Washington. Alex Wong/Getty Images 
  President Trump told reporters that he believes Dr, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was “confused” when he said a Covid-19 vaccine wouldn’t be widely available in the US until the third quarter or second quarter of 2021.  “I think he made a mistake when he said that. It’s just incorrect information,” Trump said when asked about Redfield’s comments to the Senate earlier today.  Redfield told Congress earlier Wednesday on a vaccine: "If you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we're probably looking at late 2nd quarter/3rd quarter 2021." 
  Trump added on Redfield: “I believe he was confused” and continued to claim that a vaccine will be distributed “very soon” despite his public health officials testimony. Trump also said the release of a coronavirus vaccine could happen by mid-October which is quicker than the vaccine distribution materials released today by the CDC outlined. Trump said distribution of a vaccine will begin as soon as a vaccine is approved, which he said could be “sometime in October.” “We think we can start sometime in October. So as soon as it is announced, we’ll be able to start. That will be from mid-October on. It may be a little later than that,” Trump said at a news conference at the White House on Wednesday. “We will be all set. As soon as it's given the go ahead and they are doing trials as you know and as soon as it's given the go ahead we will get it out, defeat the virus.” The  CDC’s vaccine distribution playbook  says that for planning purposes, state and local health agencies should assume “limited COVID-19 vaccine doses may be available by early November 2020” if a vaccine is authorized or licensed by the FDA, but the supply may increase substantially in 2021. Later in his briefing, Trump said a vaccine could be announced “fairly soon, regardless this month, next month, in a level of time nobody thought was possible.” Today, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said he still anticipates a vaccine would take until November or December before it’s proven safe and effective.  ‘‘I would still put my money on November/December,” Fauci said, during a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute panel on global pandemics. On Tuesday, Trump said he thinks a vaccine could be ready in three to four weeks. Chief of staff Mark Meadows echoed that claim on Wednesday. "I have been on phone calls with individuals who have said that personally to me," Meadows said in response to a question from CNN, but said he would not give specific names because "it would affect markets and I'm not going to do that."

  6:26 p.m. ET, September 16, 2020 University of Georgia reports a 70% drop in Covid-19 cases From CNN’s Maria Cartaya The University of Georgia released its weekly Covid-19 report today showing that cases have declined “more than 70% over the course of a week.”  The university reported a total of 421 positive tests between Sept. 7 to 13.  “Of those, 404 were students, 16 were staff, and one was a faculty member,” according to the report.   On Wednesday, the school also announced that there will be no on-campus voting in the fall.    “These data give us some cautious optimism that cases might have plateaued on our campus,” said Dr. Garth Russo, executive director of the University Health Center and chair of UGA’s Medical Oversight Task Force. “However, we are by no means out of the woods yet. We know that we had a short week due to the Labor Day holiday, and we hope that we will not see a spike in positive cases from activities that weekend. Each member of our campus community must remain diligent in our individual efforts to curb the spread of the virus if we want to keep these numbers on a downward trend." 
  The University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, has “nearly 50,000 students, faculty and staff,” according to the university.

  6:21 p.m. ET, September 16, 2020 Dr. Tom Frieden: US nearing 200,000 Covid-19 deaths is a "reflection of a failing national response" From CNN's Leinz Vales Former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Tom Frieden testifies during a hearing on Covid-19 Response before the Subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies of the House Appropriations Committee May 6 on Capitol Hill in Washington.

  As the United States approaches 200,000 coronavirus deaths, Dr. Tom Frieden, a former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, said Wednesday that the number of reported deaths are a "reflection of a failing national response." "The actual number is higher because not all deaths have been identified and this is just a horrifying number," Frieden told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "It's more people than die from suicide or overdose or homicide or HIV. In fact, Covid is on track to be the number three leading cause of death in all of the US for this year." The former CDC director said he's concerned that Americans will get "hardened" to the number of coronavirus deaths.  As of Wednesday afternoon, the US has reported at least 196,465 coronavirus deaths, according to  Johns Hopkins University . According to Johns Hopkins, 1,293 deaths were reported Tuesday, which is the  highest one-day total  since Aug. 19. "If you look at Germany, one fifth are death rate," Frieden said. "If you look at South Korea, 80 times fewer deaths than we've had. These are lives that have been lost and jobs that have been lost because we haven't had an organized, consistent, coherent federal response."

  5:55 p.m. ET, September 16, 2020 Mistrust in government is hindering Covid-19 surveillance efforts, expert says From CNN's Lauren Mascarenhas Mistrust in government agencies is hindering Covid-19 surveillance efforts, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said Wednesday. “It is very challenging in many areas today, where we're seeing people who do not want to participate in any kind of follow up with regard to surveillance, because of their distrust of government and the public health system,” Osterholm said during an American Public Health Association webinar. 
  Osterholm said that challenges in agencies, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Food and Drug Administration, have eroded trust in the whole public health system.  “There has been more than enough public discussion of challenges about the validity of the information coming from those areas, that then often will translate into the public's trust of even state and local health departments and the compliance with contact tracers,” Osterholm said.

  Public health experts have long warned that the Covid-19 pandemic could worsen the world's hunger crises. Now it appears that the number of people who face acute food insecurity has doubled, said Valerie Guarnieri, the World Food Program's assistant executive director.  "Last year, we had anticipated — based on all of the assessments and all of the projections — that the number of people in a state of severe food insecurity this year would be 135 million," Guarnieri told reporters during a virtual meeting hosted by the United Nations Foundation on Wednesday. "As a result of Covid, we are now anticipating that that number will be 270 million — so basically a doubling of acute food insecurity as a result of Covid and the Covid compounding impact on pre-existing crises." 
  She said the World Food Program is looking to scale up its efforts to reach 138 million people who are food insecure this year.  The Global Network Against Food Crises — launched by the European Union, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program — released a report on Tuesday detailing how the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are driving up acute hunger in vulnerable countries that were already facing food crises. More details:  The report notes that while currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo has the largest food crisis in absolute numbers, there has been a nearly 300% increase in acute food insecurity in Burkina Faso, a 73% increase in northern Nigeria, a 67% increase in Somalia and a 64% increase in Sudan.

  5:09 p.m. ET, September 16, 2020 Illinois governor extends eviction moratorium due to the pandemic From CNN’s Hira Humayun Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. Source: Pool 
  Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker spoke about the financial impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and impacts on housing in the state, saying he would extend the state’s eviction moratorium for an additional 30 days. Pritzker said at a news conference on Wednesday that he would continue to work with leaders in the general assembly and Congress to advocate for more federal assistance to keep people in their homes. “Over 100,000 Illinois tenants and homeowners applied for our assistance program. But we only have enough funds to support approximately 40,000 of them. And ours is the largest pandemic housing stability program in the nation. It is for that reason that I will be extending out eviction moratorium for an additional 30 days,” he said. 
  The governor also said there have been outbreaks of Covid-19 over the summer, tied to youth sports across the state and across the world. “Over the summer we saw outbreaks across Illinois and around the world, tied to a variety of youth sports leagues. Those continue today even among the lowest risk youth sports,” Pritzker said. Over the past two weeks, the governor said, nearly every region in the state has seen a stable or declining positivity rate.  He said the Illinois Department of Public Health will continue to monitor the positivity over the next few says and that if the trend holds for three days, “we will remove the resurgence mitigations and return the entire region to phase four of the Restore Illinois Plan.”

  4:31 p.m. ET, September 16, 2020 The wide spectrum of Covid-19 disease still puzzles Fauci From CNN's Andrea Kane Of all the viral diseases and emerging infections that he's encountered throughout his career, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he has “never seen anything with a range” like the novel coronavirus, which he said suggests factors other than underlying medical conditions affect disease severity.  At least 40% of patients have no symptoms, while some stay ill for months on end, Fauci said.  “It's just completely unique to see that degree of variability of a single microbe, which means there are things that are determining that, that we still at this point don't understand,” Fauci said. 
  “It isn't just whether you have an underlying disease or not – it's just not the case. It's something more than that,” he added during a virtual panel on the global pandemic sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.  He said one of those factors may be “the rate of expression of ACE2 receptors.”  These are molecular doorways into cells that the novel coronavirus appears to favor. Some cells have more of these receptors than others do. Fauci said this variability has created confusion. It’s helped fuel misunderstandings about who can spread the virus and when.  "One of the things we're dealing with in this country is a real lack of understanding of the importance of everybody trying to prevent getting infected rather than inadvertently… propagating the outbreak," he said. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post incorrectly described the number of patients who lack coronavirus symptoms. It is at least 40%.

  During a Covid-19 briefing Wednesday, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy   addressed the party organized by YouTubers that authorities broke up Monday evening, calling it an “egregious display of knucklehead behavior” and “irresponsible from top to bottom in every respect.” Murphy said that it took a “substantial” amount of law enforcement resources from neighboring towns to break up the party and urged attendees to get tested.  “We are continuing to see case numbers climb among young people. Many of these cases and clusters are a result of parties and social gatherings,” state health commissioner Judy Persichilli added.  
  Since mid-August, the percent positivity rate among 14-18 year-olds has grown from 3% to 7%, while for 19-24 year olds it’s risen from 2.7% to 7.1%, she said.  Murphy said that “the system is working inside the walls” of schools, while the state’s greater concern is what is happening outside of them. He went on to clarify that the state does not have any clear evidence of in-school transmission of the virus, and that proper protocol has been followed thus far if a case does arise.  What the latest numbers are:  Murphy reported 447 new positive Covid-19 cases, bringing the state’s total to 197,792. As of Sept. 12, New Jersey’s daily positivity rate is 2.06%, said Murphy, while the statewide rate of transmission remains at 1.06.  There were nine new fatalities reported, bringing state's total to 14,263 virus-related deaths.  One thing to note:  These numbers released by the New Jersey Department of Health may not line up exactly in real time with CNN’s database drawn from Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project.
