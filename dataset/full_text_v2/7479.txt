  2:19 p.m. ET, March 28, 2020 Trump says he'll make decision “very shortly” on possible quarantines for New York, surrounding area From CNN's Nicky Robertson  Patrick Semansky/AP 
  During a ceremony to see off the Naval hospital ship USNS Comfort from Norfolk, Virginia, President Donald Trump reiterated he will make a decision “very quickly, very shortly” on whether to place a quarantine on parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to help battle coronavirus.  In his various comments Saturday on the possibility of quarantines, Trump has not detailed exactly which areas would be covered.  The President did say in a tweet that he is considering putting a quarantine on “hot spots” in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut; seeming to indicate it would be the portions of the states seeing the largest outbreaks.  In his speech in Norfolk, Trump said that “this does not apply to people such as truckers from outside the New York area who are making deliveries or simply transiting through. It won't affect trade in any way.”

  New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center physicians have developed and implemented a strategy to enable a single mechanical ventilator to fully support two patients simultaneously in carefully selected patients under the right conditions, according to a statement from a spokesperson. "The rigorous, detailed protocol for this strategy has been shared with other hospital systems, the state of New York, and our hospital associations. The aim of developing and openly sharing this information is to help hospitals address a critical shortage of these life-saving machines by increasing the number of patients who can be supported with existing supply," a statement from the medical center said.

  1:46 p.m. ET, March 28, 2020 Rhode Island governor confirms first coronavirus-related deaths, issues stay-at-home order From CNN’s Mirna Alsharif Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo announced the state's first two coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday in a press conference. "These were the first two deaths and will certainly not be the last two," Raimondo said at the press conference. "I will say that this is, for me and for all of us, a reminder of the stakes that we face." 
  The governor also issued a stay-at-home order state-wide on Saturday. Raimondo's decision comes after she announced that only 50% of residents are complying to social distancing restrictions already in place. The governor said that half of the state’s population is gathering in parks, hosting and attending house parties and not complying to social distancing in grocery stores. "I've said it last week, I'm going to say it again, knock it off. You're risking the lives of everyone in this state," warned Raimondo. 
  Raimondo also said that the state now has a total of 239 coronavirus cases, a 39 case increase from Friday.

  Some Instacart shoppers are  planning to strike on Monday, accusing  the company of not providing them enough protections during the coronavirus pandemic. The strike is being called for by Instacart shoppers and a newly formed non-profit called Gig Workers Collective. It was first reported Friday by Vice. "Instacart has still not provided essential protections to Shoppers on the front lines that could prevent them from becoming carriers, falling ill themselves, or worse," Instacart Shoppers and Gig Workers Collective wrote in a Medium blog post. 
  Some context:  Instacart is one of  several companies delivering essentials  to households and now expanding rapidly at a time when much of the American economy is at risk of contracting.  Amazon and Walmart each recently announced they plan to hire at least 100,000 workers due to increased customer demand. Yet, there are concerns about whether companies are doing enough for workers, who are the backbone of the services they offer, during this unprecedented public health crisis.

  Gov. Laura Kelly has issued a stay at home order for the state Kansas beginning March 30 at 12:01 p.m. in order to contain the spread of Covid-19. At a press conference this afternoon, Kelly said the order would provide more consistency and stability across the state.  “As we speak, well over half of Kansas’ population falls under a local stay at home order of some kind. Even without the executive order I'm issuing today, Kansas’ most populous counties have already issued local state orders to their communities," Kelly said. “As governor, I left these decisions to local health departments for as long as possible. But the reality is that a patchwork approach is a recipe for confusion in our statewide fight to slow the spread of coronavirus that statewide uniformity will ensure. We're all playing by the same rules, and it would help prevent an influx of new cases for local health departments, many of which are already stretched to max.” 
  Kelly said the step is also being taken now to continue to slow the spread of Covid-19 in Kansas, as hospitals are preparing their facilities for the inevitable surge of patients, “But we're simply not ready for what we anticipate will be the peak of this pandemic.” By the numbers:  Kansas currently has  202 people  who have tested positive for coronavirus; four people have died from it.

  1:01 p.m. ET, March 28, 2020 Cuomo says he did not speak to Trump about a quarantine for New York  Darren McGee/Office of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo via AP 
  Following news that President Trump is mulling a short term quarantine for New York and surrounding areas, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he "didn't speak to him about any quarantine." "I spoke to the president about the ship coming up and the four sites. I didn't speak to him about any quarantine," Cuomo said Saturday during a press conference. "No, I haven't had those conversations. I don't even know what that means." 
  Earlier today:  Trump said he is thinking about a possible “short term, two week” quarantine for "New York, probably New Jersey and certain parts of Connecticut." Speaking at the White House, Trump said "we might not have to do it, but there’s a possibility sometime today" he will enact a quarantine. Trump said that this would be an “enforceable quarantine,” one that would restrict travel because New Yorkers have been traveling to Florida and “we don’t want that.” Trump said he would rather not do it, “but we may need it."
