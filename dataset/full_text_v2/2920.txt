  The White House announced Saturday that they would expand the European travel ban to include the United Kingdom and Ireland beginning midnight on Monday.
  "Again, Americans in the U.K. or Ireland can come home," Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday. "Legal residents can come home."
  Trump had initially said during his  Oval Office address  on Monday night that Ireland and the U.K. were exempt from the ban, although it was unclear why the exception was made because the virus is also present in Britain.
