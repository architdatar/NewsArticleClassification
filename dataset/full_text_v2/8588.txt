  Zoom CEO Eric Yuan announced Wednesday that his rapidly-growing videoconferencing company is creating a  new advisory board  to help address the security issues that have made it the target of lawsuits and political pressure.
  Alex Stamos, a former chief security officer at Facebook and current NBC News contributor, has  joined the company  as an outside consultant. The move comes one day after  Yuan told NBC News  that he had to “double down on privacy, double down on security."
  Many non-Zoom users have recently become aware of the distasteful practice of “Zoombombing,” or crashing an unintentionally public Zoom call for the purposes of harassing people.
