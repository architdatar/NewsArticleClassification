  For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, only 1 percent of people in New York City tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced at a news briefing Tuesday.
  De Blasio called it "an extraordinary day for New York City." He said more and more tests are being conducted every day, making the number even more impressive. 
  "It doesn’t mean we don't need to keep fighting, because we do. But I am so proud of New Yorkers — you have earned this one," de Blasio said. "Every time you keep that face mask on, every time you stay home when you can, every time you practice social distancing, you’re beating back this disease."
