  Connecticut on Thursday joined a growing list of states that have  asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency  for a disaster declaration to cope with the "severity and magnitude" of the coronavirus outbreak.
  The state has seen at least 875 cases of the virus and 19 deaths, although officials said they believe there are "many more cases" that have not yet been confirmed. Gov. Ned Lamont said federal assistance could help residents gain additional resources, including for childcare and crisis counseling.
  President Donald Trump in recent days has  also declared  disasters in New York, California, Washington, Louisiana, Iowa, Florida and Texas.
