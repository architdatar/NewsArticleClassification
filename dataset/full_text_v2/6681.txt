  US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn will self quarantine for the next 14 days after coming in contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus, FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum told CNN. “As Dr. Hahn wrote in a note to staff today, he recently came into contact with an individual who has tested positive for Covid-19," Felderbaum's statement said. "Per CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines, he is now in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He immediately took a diagnostic test and tested negative for the virus.” 
  While the FDA would not name the person Hahn came into contact with, President Donald Trump announced earlier Friday that Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary Katie Price had tested positive. An official familiar with situation inside the White House Coronavirus Task Force told CNN that it’s unclear whether some on the panel will go into quarantine.

  12:56 a.m. ET, May 9, 2020 Allies despair as Trump abandons America's leadership role at a time of global crisis From CNN's Nicole Gaouette, Jennifer Hansler, Kylie Atwood and Angela Dewan US President Donald Trump attends a coronavirus response meeting in the White House on May 7 in Washington, DC.

  The United States has scaled back its role on the world stage, taken actions that are undermining efforts to battle the  coronavirus pandemic  and left the international community without a traditional global leader, according to experts, diplomats and analysts. The US -- usually at the head of the table helping to coordinate in global crises -- has declined to take a seat at virtual international meetings convened by the World Health Organization and the European Union to coordinate work on potentially lifesaving vaccines. Former world leaders warn that the Trump administration risks alienating allies by politicizing the deadly pandemic with its push to punish China and have other nations choose sides. The administration's decision to  halt funding for the WHO , the world body best positioned to coordinate the global response to the raging pandemic, has appalled global health officials. Incredulity and sadness:  And where US presidents have in the past offered a steadying voice, observers from the Asia Pacific to Europe expressed incredulity, amusement and sadness at President Donald Trump's briefings on the virus, saying they are deeply damaging to the US image abroad.  US officials push back, touting both funding to fight Covid-19 as well as work Trump is doing through the Group of Seven and bilaterally -- leading more than 50 calls with world leaders. But experts say funding without full global coordination can slow overall progress.  At a time when nearly 4 million people worldwide have been infected with the virus, diplomats say many countries are yearning for the firm US leadership they've seen at historic moments and in prior epidemics, citing President Barack Obama's response to Ebola and President George W. Bush's work on HIV/AIDS. "They want the US to lean in more," said one European diplomat. "We know they're doing a great deal with countries, including developing countries, bilaterally ... but a lot of countries hanker after the decisive US effort that we saw when the Berlin Wall came down. A lot of countries believe this is one of those pivotal moments in history and the US has always led at those times."

  12:36 a.m. ET, May 9, 2020 20.5 million American jobs were lost in April, the largest decline since records began ... by far From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe A store remains closed near Wall Street on May 8, in New York City.  Spencer Platt/Getty Images 
  With much of the American economy in self-imposed shutdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus, April's colossal surge in unemployment delivered a historic blow to workers. The US economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the  Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday  — by far the most sudden and largest decline since the government began tracking the data in 1939. Those losses follow steep cutbacks in March as well, when employers slashed 870,000 jobs. Those two months amount to layoffs so severe, they more than double the 8.7 million jobs lost during the financial crisis. For many Americans who lost their jobs and their homes in the 2008 financial crisis, this moment reopens old wounds. It took years to rebound from those setbacks. When the economy eventually did crawl back, US employers added 22.8 million jobs over 10 years — a victory for all those who had weathered the Great Recession. Now, the coronavirus pandemic stings not only because of the public health crisis it has inflicted — but also because it wiped out nearly that whole decade of job gains in just two months.

  12:16 a.m. ET, May 9, 2020 FDA authorizes first at-home Covid-19 saliva test From CNN's Jacqueline Howard The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued an emergency use authorization for the first at-home Covid-19 test that uses saliva samples,  the agency said in a news release . Rutgers University's RUCDR Infinite Biologics lab received an amended emergency authorization late Thursday. With the test, people can collect their own saliva at home and send samples to a lab for results. Testing for Covid-19 so far has usually involved nose or throat swab samples. In April, Rutgers University announced the  FDA authorized the saliva test  that it developed with other groups for "emergency use" for diagnosing Covid-19. "What's new and next is expanding access to testing for people," Andrew Brooks, chief operating officer and director of technology development at the RUCDR Infinite Biologics lab, told CNN. "If people are committed to do self-collection and can facilitate that collection at home, certainly with a prescription under medical care, we can get to those that are quarantined, don't have the means for transportation or are too scared to go outside. So they get the test in the mail or from a distribution center."

  The unemployment rate in Los Angeles rose from 4.7% in February to more than 24% in April according to city estimates, Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a press conference on Friday. "Those aren't just numbers, those are lives and livelihoods," Garcetti said, while addressing the economic impact of the coronavirus. "These are our neighbors and they're hurting." 
  Los Angeles county has reported 30,296 coronavirus cases and 1,468 deaths. Garcetti said that this week’s data was “less deadly than last week.”  Testing in Los Angeles:  Garcetti encouraged residents to get tested, as asymptomatic cases have been found. This is important for contact tracing and prevention of the disease, he added. Los Angeles has capacity to test 20,000 people per day, and has met the basic minimum thresholds established by experts for acceptable levels of daily testing needed to consider steps to reopen, according to Garcetti.

  Roy Horn, half of the popular Las Vegas animal and magic act Siegfried and Roy, died Friday of complications from the coronavirus, according to his publicist. He was 75 years old. Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn and Siegfried Fischbacher began their upbeat performances in Europe, later becoming regulars in Las Vegas, where they would perform for four decades.  Their revue ended after Horn was attacked on stage by a tiger named  Mantecore in 2003 , severing Horn’s spine. Horn was eventually able to walk again, but he and Siegfried would only perform together one more time -- for a benefit -- before retiring in 2010. “Today, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend,” Fischbacher said in a written statement. “From the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried.”
