  A New York City man in his 60s who was experiencing homelessness died at a hospital from the coronavirus, a spokesperson for the city's Department of Homeless Services said. His death is believed to be the first COVID-19 fatality among the city's homeless.
  The person, who has not been identified, was hospitalized days prior to his death after testing positive for the virus. 
  As of Tuesday, there were 39 confirmed coronavirus cases among New York City's sheltered homeless population, including the man who died, the Homeless Services spokesperson said. Eleven of those individuals are hospitalized, and nine are in the agency's isolation units.
  Others who are homeless and have tested positive are either self-isolating on their own or have made other arrangements, including staying with family members.
