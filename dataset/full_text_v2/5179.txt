It's generally known as a business truism: under-promise and over-deliver. The idea behind the maxim is simple: it's far better to show some humility, set modest expectations, and produce impressive results than the alternative.
  As the coronavirus crisis intensifies, however, Donald Trump is over-promising and under-delivering -- which in a situation like this, is a toxic combination.
  I was reviewing the Rose Garden  press conference  the president held a week ago today, which was filled with all kinds of exciting announcements. Americans heard Trump say we'd see 1.4 million coronavirus tests this week, which did not happen. We heard him talk up a Google resource that's  still in the development stage . He even  overstated  the details surrounding plans for drive-through virus testing.
  Those who took the president's words at face value last Friday were left wanting.
  And it wasn't an isolated incident. On Wednesday, the Republican bragged about dispatching two Navy hospital ships to New York, which  wasn't quite right . Yesterday, Trump  announced  that there are promising COVID-19 treatments, which officials are "going to be able to make ... available almost immediately." It fell to the FDA to make clear soon after that this assessment  wasn't exactly true , either.
  A  Washington Post   analysis  added yesterday:
  Maybe the president believes exaggerations and hype will instill a sense of hope. Maybe he sees misplaced boasts as part of a self-aggrandizing strategy that will improve his political standing. Maybe he's confused about the relevant details and doesn't realize that his promises are wrong.
  But just once, I'd love to see Trump under-promise and over-deliver, because he's doing a whole lot of the opposite.
