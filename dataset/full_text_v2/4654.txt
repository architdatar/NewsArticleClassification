  A New Jersey woman who organized a protest of Gov. Phil Murphy's stay-at-home order was charged with violating that same order. 
  The protest took place on Friday outside the Statehouse and at other locations in Trenton, the state's Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said in his daily briefing, calling it a "prohibited event." 
  The woman who organized the protest, Kim Pagan, was charged by New Jersey State Police with violating the governor's emergency orders, which prohibits all gatherings.
