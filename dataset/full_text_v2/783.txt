  Beyoncé’s BeyGood foundation is teaming up with the singer's mother, Tina Knowles Lawson, to provide free mobile testing to their home city of Houston. 
  The initiative will kick off on Friday and continue Saturday with 1,000 available test kits. 
  "The virus is wreaking havoc on the Black community so we need a movement to prioritize our health," Knowles Lawson said in a statement. "We are all in this together. But we have to look at what is happening in our Black and Brown communities and how they are being decimated by COVID-19." 
  BeyGood and Knowles Lawson will provide face masks, gloves, essential vitamins and household supplies, according to a  press release . Participants will also receive a grocery gift card, a hot meal voucher for two local restaurants and information on how to stay safe during the pandemic. Medical staff administering the tests will also get the meal voucher.  
  Actor and producer Tyler Perry will be hosting a similar initiative in Atlanta.
