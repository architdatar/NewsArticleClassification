  The head of New York City’s Emergency Medical Services department described the five boroughs as a war zone amid the coronavirus pandemic.
  "Our EMTs and our paramedics, all our first responders in fact including all our healthcare providers, are really on the front lines of this thing and they are doing a tremendous job, but they’re fighting,” EMS chief Lillian Bonsignore told NBC News. “This is a war. We consider this a war, and they're our soldiers and unfortunately they're not immune to this virus and many of them are getting sick."
  Bonsignore said the coronavirus outbreak triggered an unprecedented volume of 911 calls.
  “I'll tell you I've been in this profession for about 30 years, so three decades, and I've never seen anything like this in my whole career or in my life for that matter,” she said.
