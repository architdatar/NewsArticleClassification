  Brits need to stop nonessential social contact and avoid clubs, pubs, theaters and all unnecessary travel as the coronavirus outbreak accelerates, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday.
  "Now is the time for everyone to stop nonessential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel," Johnson said at a news conference from Downing Street.
  He said anyone with symptoms of the coronavirus should isolate themselves along with their entire household for 14 days. Working at home, he said, should begin in earnest. "We need people to start working from home where they possibly can," Johnson said. 
  "It looks as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve, and without drastic action cases could double every five or six days," Johnson said.
