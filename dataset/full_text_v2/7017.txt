  President Donald Trump will not travel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Friday, as had originally planned to do, a White House official said, citing the fact that Trump "does not want to interfere" with the organization's work in combatting coronavirus.
  "The President is no longer traveling to Atlanta today. The CDC has been proactive and prepared since the very beginning and the President does not want to interfere with the CDCâ€™s mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency," a White House official said Friday.
  On Thursday night, Vice President Mike Pence had said that Trump would visit the CDC in Atlanta.
