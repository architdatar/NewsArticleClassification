Big retailers have made strong statements recently about their new rules requiring customers to  wear face masks  when shopping, saying that the health of their workers and customers is paramount.
  But when it comes to enforcing those mandates, the companies are taking a decidedly hands-off approach,  writes Michael Corkery :
  Some shoppers say the retailers are taking the easy way out by announcing mask policies that are not true mandates. But retailers are likely on solid legal ground if they decline service to someone refusing to wear a mask, especially if they offer alternative ways for customers to shop, such as home delivery and curbside pickup.
