  Asked about a White House-touted coronavirus model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) that had been revised to dramatically hike the likely death toll, President Donald Trump claimed the model doesn’t account for mitigation efforts.
  “That assumes no mitigation and we're going to have mitigation,” Trump told reporters. 
  That’s false. The  researchers said they upped the death toll  because states are reopening and relaxing social distancing restrictions, and cell phone data had indicated that many people were moving around more. The initial model  planned  for longer stay-at-home orders, lasting through the end of May.
