  Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., who’s up for re-election in November, said Thursday that congressional leaders should cancel recess until the House and Senate address the outbreak. 
  “Americans all over the country are looking to us to lead on mitigating the impact of this virus,” McSally said in a statement. “It is totally unacceptable for us to leave Washington, D.C., and recess without further acting to support our constituents.”
  The House and Senate are on recess next week and there’s no guarantee Congress will pass an aid package before leaving for the break, although the House was scheduled to vote on a sweeping aid package Thursday.
