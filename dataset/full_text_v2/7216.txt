  President Donald Trump's  incoming chief of staff, U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows , said Monday that he is under self-quarantine after possibly "coming into contact" with a person who tested positive for COVID-19.
  Meadows, R-North Carolina, has tested negative for the disease but will remain at home until Wednesday "out of an abundance of caution," Meadows' chief of staff, Ben Williamson, said in a statement Monday.
  Trump named Meadows as his next chief of staff last week. 
  The possible encounter occurred at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month. The statement provided no additional details about the potential exposure.
  Williamson said Meadows is not experiencing symptoms but is following precautionary recommendations.
  Several other Republican members of  Congress are also under self-quarantine , including  Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. Rep. Julia Brownley, a Democrat from California, is also self-quarantining.  
  Rep. Louis Gohmert, R-Texas, has said he is not self-quarantining despite possibly being exposed as well.
