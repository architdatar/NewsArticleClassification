  The U.K.'s National Health Service Saturday announced that 888 people have died from COVID-19-related issues since Friday.
  The number came even as Stephen Powis, NHS England's medical director, said that the number of virus-related hospitalizations was starting to level off or even go down in places like London and the Midlands.
  "It is now becoming clear that we are beginning to see reductions in the number of people with COVID-19 in hospitals," he said.
  A total of 15,464 coronavirus patients have died in U.K hospitals, health officials said Saturday. British Housing Minister Robert Jenrick said 114,217 people in the United Kingdom have tested positive so far.
