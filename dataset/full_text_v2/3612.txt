  Hearst Castle will essentially be off limits to the general public starting Monday, California State Parks officials announced Saturday. The move was described as temporary, but no end date was given.
  "In an effort to protect public health and the safety of our visitors, volunteers and staff as the state responds to the continuing outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), California State Parks is temporarily suspending all tours at Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument," the department said in a statement.
  The 165-room castle founded by newspaper publisher William Randolph Hears was not a known site of coronavirus carriers, officials said. The suspension is in line with state guidelines on preventing spread of the disease by prohibiting big social gatherings, the department said.
