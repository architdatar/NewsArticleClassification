  Gooood morning. It's Friday. We made it. “ Keep wearing the damn mask, " and see you on Monday.  
  🚨: “President Trump’s campaign has temporarily paused its television advertising with less than 100 days to go before the election, a move that comes amid a broader shake-up in his faltering bid for a second term,” our colleagues  Toluse  Olorunnipa  and  Josh Dawsey  report.  
  ‘NEVER IN THE HISTORY’:  The unquestioning fealty Republican members of Congress have paid President Trump wobbled this week after Trump floated the prospect of delaying the November election — a power he does not have. 
  A  morning tweet  that also baselessly alleged there will be mail-in voter fraud prompted Republican leaders who usually prefer to feign ignorance of Trump's Twitter feed to rebuff him. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the date of the Nov. 3 election is  set in stone  and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) also rejected the idea.
  Trump's constant push to undermine public faith in U.S. elections has intensified as he's sunk in the polls during the the coronavirus pandemic that's killed at least  148,000 Americans . The idea of delaying the election, however, was a red line for some who were previously tolerant of Trump and his allies' view of  expansive presidential power . 
  Trump appeared undaunted by the incoming criticism and later tweeted he was simply trying to get the media to  “ finally start talking about the RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Universal Mail-In-Voting (not Absentee Voting, which I totally support!).”  
  Republican governors and secretaries of state across the country quickly dismissed the president's proposal and sought to hastily clarify any confusion. And the increasingly vocal anti-Trump contingency may have gained a few new members: 
  Another problem for local and state officials:  Trump's escalating attacks on mail balloting coincided with “new procedures described as cost cutting efforts” that have taken effect at the U.S. Postal Service, our colleagues  Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Jacob Bogage scooped.  
  New Hampshire's Republican governor: 
  Trump's threat came on the heels of some of the worst economic news of the pandemic yet. 
  Even as Trump has urged schools, restaurants and the economy to reopen as  coronavirus  deaths mount, fears he might try to move the election date have persisted.  The Constitution gives Congress the power to fix the date of general elections and the 20th Amendment makes plain that Trump's four-year term would end on Jan. 20 if he loses — whether an election is held or not, our colleagues  Amy Gardner, Josh Dawsey and John Wagner report.  
  The Constitution has not stopped other members of the Trump administration from teasing a delay, either. 
  And his  blitzkrieg against  mail voting is raising red flags among some Republican pollsters who believe Trump's campaign is working against the party  —  and that GOP voters have internalized the message not to vote by mail:  
  ECONOMY CONTRACTS AT RECORD RATE:  “The U.S. economy shrank by a stunning 9.5 percent from April through June, a historic contraction and a stinging reminder of how much was lost in such a short period,”  Rachel Siegel and Andrew Van Dam report .  Negotiations over a new coronavirus stimulus package were stalled yesterday as emergency unemployment benefits were set to expire for millions of Americans. 
  Economists say this is another warning:  “While Congress clashes over another stimulus bill and the virus forces more states to shut down bars and restaurants again, there is mounting fear that the economy could be held back even more, making a true recovery much more fraught,” our colleagues write.
  WHITE HOUSE WILLING TO CUT LIABILITY SHIELD:  “The White House is willing to cut a deal with Democrats that leaves out Senate Republican legislation aimed at protecting employers, hospitals and schools from coronavirus-related lawsuits, according to two people with knowledge of internal White House planning,” Jeff Stein and Erica Werner  report  this morning.
  This would jettison McConnell's ‘red line’:  “McConnell controls the Senate floor and could shoot down any deal that leaves out what he has said is a necessary component of any stimulus package,” our colleagues caution.
  DHS ASSEMBLED INTEL REPORTS ON JOURNALISTS IN PORTLAND:  “The Department of Homeland Security has compiled ‘intelligence reports’ about the work of American journalists covering protests in Portland, Ore., in what current and former officials called an alarming use of a government system meant to share information about suspected terrorists and violent actors,”  Shane Harris reports .
  OBAMA ISSUES CALL TO ACTION IN EULOGY FOR LEWIS:  “Former president Barack Obama delivered a call to action in his eulogy of late congressman John Lewis, urging Congress to pass new voting rights laws and likening tactics by [Trump] and his administration to those used by racist Southern leaders who fought the civil rights movement in the 1960s,”  Paul Kane and John Wagner report .
  The split-screen of the day was striking: “ Three presidents spoke in poetry, paying tribute to a fallen hero who believed — often against evidence to the contrary, including the cracking of his skull by state troopers — that America was good, its people driven by love to do right by one another. One president, the current commander in chief, did not attend the funeral of Rep. John Lewis but instead spoke of dark forces in the country and suggested that the United States not hold its next presidential election on time,”  Marc Fisher writes .
  ROBERT DRAPER ON HIS NEW BOOK ABOUT THE IRAQ WAR:  The Iraq War will forever be a defining moment in American history. The quagmire that came out of the conflict overshadowed one presidency while opening the door to another. U.S. troops returned home — some steadfast in the support of their mission, others questioning decisions that got them there — while the political battle over the war  continues to reverberate  in Washington. 
  For the nation at large, the war offered yet another inflection point where its most powerful institutions,  including the one we work for , are left with its  collective legacy . All the while, thousands of families bear the grief of the nearly 5,000 Americans lives lost — along with many more Iraqis —  and tens of thousands who returned home with huge mental and physical wounds.
  With this in mind, Power Up asked Draper about his book that published this week, “ To Start a War: How the Bush Administration Took America into Iraq .” (We've edited our conversation for clarity and length.)
  WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW: 
  Former GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain died of covid-19:  “Although it is unclear where Cain, who was 74, contracted the disease, he was among several thousand people, most of whom did not wear masks, who attended a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa on June 20. Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, was photographed maskless and not socially distancing at the event,”  John Wagner, Robert Costa and Annie Gowen report .
  Basketball is back. Tributes to the Black Lives Matter movement abound:  “As the NBA resumed its season Thursday at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex outside Orlando, the absence of fans inside the league’s bubble was far from the only noticeable difference. Changes were made to the courts as well, with ‘Black Lives Matter’ printed in block lettering near the center of the floor. But perhaps the most significant aesthetic differences for this experimental conclusion of the season were the jerseys on players’ backs,”  Ava Wallace reports . Her story includes a full list of what messages each player has chosen, if any, from an agreed-upon list.
  Both games went down to the wire:
