  New York City is ramping up its  antibody testing  and plans to test roughly 70,000 people over the next two weeks, Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference Thursday. 
  The city is " launching an antibody survey to understand COVID-19 spread  and provide New Yorkers with more clarity," the mayor's press secretary, Freddi Goldstein, said in a tweet.
  There initially will be a testing site in each of the city's five boroughs, with each site providing tests free to 1,000 people a day. The initiative starts next week and is by appointment only. 
  Results will take 24 to 48 hours.
  Antibody tests  are intended to show whether a person's immune system has developed antibodies, which would indicate they were exposed to the coronavirus at some point. There have been questions about the accuracy of some antibody tests.
