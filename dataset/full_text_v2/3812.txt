  The furniture company IKEA will temporarily close all 50 of its U.S. store locations beginning Wednesday as a precautionary measure due to the coronavirus outbreak.
  “Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures,” IKEA Retail U.S. president Javier Quiñones said in a statement.
  The company told NBC News that workers will receive pay for the hours they were scheduled to work. The store's customers can still shop online and use the company’s home delivery (or store pick-up) in select locations.
