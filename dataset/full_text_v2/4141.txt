  Can a vaccine stop the [novel] coronavirus, and how long might one take? 
  — Sammie R., 8, and Zeshawn R., 10, Alexandria, Virginia 
  The good news is that, yes, because covid-19 is caused by a virus, scientists should be able to create a vaccine that protects us against it. Successful vaccines already exist for the viruses that cause measles, polio and smallpox, for instance.
  As for how long it will take to develop and distribute a coronavirus vaccine, that part is a bit trickier. Typically this process requires several years before a vaccine can be designed, tested and given to the public. But because this is not a normal situation, early versions of a coronavirus vaccine are being given to volunteers in Seattle, Washington, and Atlanta, Georgia.
  In the best-case scenario, a vaccine could be ready for the world in 12 to 18 months, said Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a recent news conference with President Trump. But only time will tell.
