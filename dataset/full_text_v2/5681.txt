  Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, introduced a plan Friday to give hazard pay to workers on the front lines of the coronavirus fight. 
  The 2012 presidential nominee’s  “Patriot Pay” plan  would provide temporary bonus pay of up to $12 an hour from May through July. A quarter of that pay would be given by employers and and three-quarters by the federal government and funded through a refundable payroll tax credit, the announcement said. 
  “Health care professionals, grocery store workers, food processors, and many others — the unsung patriots on the frontline of this pandemic — every day risk their safety for the health and well-being of our country, and they deserve our unwavering support,” Romney said.
  Romney, who was the only Republican senator to  vote to convict Trump  during the president's impeachment trial earlier this year, was also the only Republican  not invited  earlier this month to serve on the president’s task force to reopen the U.S. economy. Senate Democrats also  unveiled a plan  this month to support frontline workers, giving them up to $13 an hour in extra pay.
