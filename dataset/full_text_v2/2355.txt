President Donald Trump announced late Monday he was suspending immigration into the U.S., saying  he would sign an executive order  that would help "protect jobs" impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. 
  Earlier in Washington, a deal appeared close to provide an  additional $300 billion for small businesses  crushed by the lockdowns. The agreement would also provide more funding for hospitals and for testing. In New York, the state most impacted by the virus, public health officials kicked off  the most extensive antibody testing campaign  in the nation. Governor Andrew Cuomo will visit Tuesday with Trump at the White House.
  In other news, the nation's leaders  wrangled over bailouts  while governors  chipped away at lockdowns  and hundreds of people gathered to protest the stay-at-home restrictions.
  Stocks  struggled and oil prices took another nosedive  under the weight of the sagging economy. In Pennsylvania's capital city of Harrisburg, protesters opposed to  Gov. Tom Wolf's restrictive stay-at-home order gathered  at the Capitol building. 
  Similar protests have been  springing up across the nation  as jobless numbers rise and patience thins.
  The U.S. coronavirus death toll rose to surpass 42,000; there are more than 786,000 confirmed cases, according to  John Hopkins University data . The number of worldwide cases was nearing 2.5 million; there are over 170,000 deaths.

  President Trump announced  he was temporarily suspending immigration  to the U.S., citing the need to protect jobs as the country is dealing with coronavirus pandemic.
  "In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” Trump tweeted.
  The move by the president comes after immigration bans from China and Europe were put in place to deal with the spread of the COVID-19. 
  New York governor Andrew Cuomo, a frequent sparring partner of President Trump during the coronavirus crisis, will visit the White House Tuesday, Trump said during his daily pandemic press briefing Monday.
  New York has been the hardest hit by COVID-19 with more than 250,000 cases and 18,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins database tracking the virus, but numbers have been improving.
  "They're really getting it together in New York, a lot of good things are happening in New York," Trump said. "And I think the governor is coming to see us tomorrow. He's coming to the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon. Andrew is going to be coming in with some of his people, so we're looking forward to that."
  The meeting comes on the heels of a testy exchange Friday between the two politicians. After Cuomo chastised the president for asking governors to take on coronavirus challenges without federal resources, Trump tweeted that the governor should "spend more time 'doing' and less time 'complaining.'" Cuomo responded that all the president seemed to be doing was "walking in front of the parade."
  On Monday, Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina and Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia moved forward with separate measures that ease restrictions on the temporary closures of certain businesses in their states.
  McMaster  announced a plan called "Accelerate South Carolina"  that will allow clothing, department, furniture, jewelry and sporting goods stores, as well as florists and flea markets to reopen at reduced capacity. The closure on beaches will be lifted, though it will be up to local officials to decide on the reopening of specific beaches.
  The order will go into effect Tuesday and still encourages social distancing directives to be followed. Barbershops, beauty salons, bingo halls, gyms and nightclubs must remain closed for now.
  Kemp said he was allowing certain businesses to reopen on Friday, including gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, barbers, cosmetologists and massage therapists. They must also adhere to social distancing measures.
  Bars, nightclubs and entertainment operations will remain closed, but restaurants and theaters will be able to reopen April, 27.
  New York City's Pride Parade, which would have marked its 50th anniversary, and the Puerto Rican Day Parade were among all major events canceled Monday in June by Mayor Bill de Blasio. City hospitalizations and deaths appear to be in a modest decline, but De Blasio has said the city can't ease its tight stay-at-home restrictions until extensive daily testing can be worked out.
  “That march is such an important part of life in this city, but this year in particular was going to be something that was a historical moment,” de Blasio said of the Pride Parade. “They will be back, and we will find the right way to do it.”
  Hundreds of protesters, many ignoring social distancing rules, rallied at the Pennsylvania Capitol in Harrisburg on Monday in opposition of the state's shutdown of schools and businesses. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, released a phase-in plan last week aimed at reopening the state but provided few details and no timeline. Limitations on mass gatherings will remain in place for the duration of the reopening process, and a “strong testing regime” must be in place in areas that are permitted to reopen, according to the plan.
  In Denver a day earlier, health care workers  blocked a parade of protesters  who gathered outside of Colorado’s Capitol in opposition of the state’s stay-at-home orders. Viral photos show counter-protesters in teal scrubs and matching masks with crossed arms standing in front of motorists lined up for several blocks  leading to the Capitol building.
  Iconic baseball bat brand Louisville Slugger is hoping the coronavirus doesn’t strike it out. With the start of Major League Baseball on indefinite hold and no revenue coming in, fifth-generation company Hillerich & Bradsby  has been forced to furlough 171 employees , which is most of its workforce. They will receive benefits and health insurance, but no pay. Those still employed got a 25% pay cut.
  “We’re not doing any advertising. We’ve cut all our expenses we can. We’re just hoping we get back to normal before we run out of cash,” CEO John Hillerich IV told the Louisville Courier Journal. H&B was sold to sporting goods manufacturer Wilson in 2015 for $70 million. It typically makes around 50,000 bats a year, the long-time weapons of choice for everyone from Babe Ruth to Derek Jeter.
  H&B tried to access federal aid through its bank, but later found out that Wells Fargo was only applying on behalf of much smaller companies. By the time H&B reapplied for Small Business Administration loans, funds had run out. Adding to the bat-maker’s concerns is the fragile nature of its raw material. If not turned into bats soon, the logs currently sitting in the company’s warehouses could soon become worthless due to rot.

  The head of the World Health Organization warned that “the worst is yet ahead of us” in the coronavirus outbreak, a dire prediction coming as many countries and U.S. states are beginning to ease restrictive measures. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus didn’t detail his warning, but global health officials have previously warned that the coronavirus could prove brutal as it sweeps through Africa, where health systems are far less developed.
  President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused WHO of failing to provide accurate, up-to-date information on the coronavirus outbreak and has frozen U.S. funding to the agency.
  U.S. stocks were  traded lower and oil prices plummeted  Monday despite indications the nation's slumbering economy could soon begin to awaken. The Dow Industrials and broader Standard and Poor's averages were down more than 2% and 1%, respectively, although tech stocks were higher. The economic upheaval caused by coronavirus layoffs and stay-at-home orders has softened oil demand to where there is little space left in U.S. storage facilities for what is being pumped from the ground.
  Several states, however, have announced plans to begin easing lockdown restrictions. National companies were also beginning to stir – Boeing was set to begin ramping up production in Washington state, where approximately 27,000 people could return to work this week, the planemaker said.
  New research suggests that many people have had the coronavirus without symptoms, fueling hope that it will turn out to be much less lethal than feared. But without widespread antibody testing it would also make it difficult to know who around you may be contagious, complicating decisions about returning to work, school and normal life.
  In the last week, reports of "silent infections" have come from a homeless shelter in Boston, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, pregnant women at a New York hospital, several European countries and California. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 25% of infected people might not have symptoms. Pentagon officials say it may be as high as 60% to 70% among military personnel.
  New York state kicked off  a large-scale antibody testing program  to determine what percentage of the population has contracted the coronavirus in advance of reviving the state's economy. A total of 3,000 people will be randomly selected for testing this week to determine if their bodies have built up an immunity. 
  Gov. Andrew Cuomo said data metrics of coronavirus cases, deaths, hospitalizations and intubations “would suggest we’re seeing a descent” of the outbreak in the state. There were 478 coronavirus deaths Sunday, which was down from 507 the day before. The decline has been fairly steady for several days. Cuomo did say that emergency rooms “are still at or over capacity, but it’s better than it was” and that new hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 “were basically flat.”

  Many marijuana stores shuttered by lockdowns are embracing the change,  allowing customers to order online and pick up curbside . That's a major shift from when each buyer had to be personally verified by a licensed store worker. In California, stores have largely switched to an all-delivery model. Regulators in many states have declare cannabis shops essential business on par with groceries, gas and liquor. Some cannabis advocates are optimistic the outbreak is providing an opportunity to move further into the mainstream. 
  "In a sea of chaos, this was one of the biggest moments in our industry's history," investor Morgan Paxhia said.

  President Donald Trump said he's "OK" with Nevada's closure of nonessential businesses, which has shuttered Las Vegas casinos, days after the  city's mayor called the shutdown "total insanity."  Trump gave qualified support Sunday to Nevada's Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak's closure amid the coronavirus pandemic. Nevada has 3,728 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 155 deaths. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, who identifies as an independent, called on Sisolak to allow businesses to reopen.
  "They closed a big hotel down in Nevada that I have in Las Vegas. It’s a very severe step he took. I’m OK with it," Trump said. "But you could call that one either way."

  The White House and Congressional leaders were nearing a deal to replenish a program geared to  keeping small businesses from shuttering  and their employees from going on unemployment. The agreement would provide another $300 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, which has burned through its initial $349 billion for loans to small businesses. The deal would also provide $75 billion to help overwhelmed hospitals and $25 billion to increase the capacity to test for the virus. But a number of disagreements remain over details, including how those funds will be divided and spent.

  Several horror stories have emerged in recent weeks from cruise ships struggling to find welcoming ports while battling sometimes deadly waves of coronavirus. Not so the Costa Deliziosa, whose  passengers began disembarking in Barcelona  on Monday after traveling  the globe for 15 weeks while the new coronavirus spread on land.
  Owner Costa Crociere, an Italian company, says the ship has no cases of the COVID-19 virus on board. The boat sailed the last five weeks with virtually no human contact with the outside world. Hundreds of the boat’s 1,831 passengers, including 168 Spaniards, were expected to get off the boat in Spain and the rest were expected to do so in the next and last stop, in Genoa, Italy.
  Queen Elizabeth II’s husband issued a rare public statement,  praising those tackling the new coronavirus pandemic and keeping essential services running . Prince Philip, who turns 99 in June, applauded the “vital and urgent” work of medical and science professionals as well as people working in food production, garbage collection and postal and delivery services.
  The shoutout comes as hospital organizations are slamming Britain’s government for its failure to give medical staff appropriate clothing and equipment to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. With so many promises dashed, Chris Hopson of the NHS Providers told the BBC there is “relatively low confidence” that a shipment of 400,000 surgical gowns overdue from Turkey will arrive Monday. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden says he’s hopeful “that later today that flight will take off and we will get those gowns.’’
  Shake Shack i s sending back the $10 million  it received from the government's stimulus loans program aimed at saving small businesses ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti and founder Danny Meyer said the company sought the loan because it was supposed to be open to all businesses with 500 or fewer employees. The criteria applies to the chain’s individual franchise locations. The company secured separate funding last week through a public stock transaction.
  "The 'PPP' came with no user manual and it was extremely confusing," the executives said in a joint statement.
