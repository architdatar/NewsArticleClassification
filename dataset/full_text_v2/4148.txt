  Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican in leadership, said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin   and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows   told senators that  stimulus negotiations  are slow going and Democrats still aren’t serious about negotiating an outcome. “We are prepared to be in session until we get one,” Cornyn said. “We will be in session next week if we don’t get a resolution this week.” 
  Asked if senators would be in session all of August, he said he couldn’t predict that. “How do you think it looks for us to go back home if this is unresolved? This is the most important thing we need to be doing.”

  1:46 p.m. ET, August 4, 2020 Brazil's health ministry says it is seeking alternatives if Oxford vaccine delayed From Marcia Reverdosa in São Paulo Brazil is seeking alternatives with other producers if there is a delay in the development and delivery of the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, Brazil’s Deputy Secretary of Health Élcio Franco said. "Because it is a purchase based on (unproven) technology, there is a degree of uncertainty. Although it seems remote to us, there is a possibility of a delay in the vaccine development. Even being in the most advanced (stage), we have been looking for alternatives," Franco said during a news conference on Monday evening. In late July, Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello announced his government had the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine "on the radar," after Anvisa (the country's National Health Surveillance Agency) approved the trial in Brazil.  Pazuello had also confirmed negotiations with the biotechnology company Moderna for a possible priority purchase of their vaccine.

  Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Indianapolis 500 officials talked about attendance levels of some 300,000 for the 2020 version of America's iconic open-wheel event. That number is now zero.  Indianapolis Motor Speedway tweeted Tuesday, "It is with great regret that we announce the Indianapolis 500 will take place on Aug. 23 without fans. This tough decision was made following careful consideration and extensive consultation with state and city leadership." Just two weeks ago, track officials announced they would allow 25% capacity at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, with a mandatory face mask protocol in place. That statement was preceded by a late-June announcement indicating a 50% cap on attendance. The race was originally scheduled to run May 24, but was postponed by Covid-19.

  More than two dozen House Democrats sent a letter Tuesday urging congressional leaders to include provisions to boost mask use in the United States in the next round of coronavirus stimulus. In a letter led by Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Adam Schiff, the lawmakers requested that Congress provide free masks to all Americans, funding for a CDC public service announcement campaign about masks, and provisions for research into "mask efficacy and optimal design.” "Masks are one of the most effective and least disruptive interventions that we have against COVID-19, and the upcoming legislative package is a perfect opportunity to send a clear message to the American people that masks work,” the lawmakers wrote. 
  They said the masks could be distributed by the US Postal Service and made accessible at convenient pick-up locations around the country. "While nothing short of a vaccine or a cure can truly end the threat of this virus, we must aggressively pursue simple and affordable courses of action that can mitigate infections and save tens of thousands of lives,” they argued.

  12:58 p.m. ET, August 4, 2020 Buying Covid-19 vaccines ahead of time easier than purchasing treatments, federal official says From CNN's Maggie Fox  The federal government may be buying up possible coronavirus vaccines ahead of time, but buying treatments such as drugs and antibodies is a different matter, a top official said Tuesday. Dr. Janet Woodcock, a Food and Drug Administration official who leads therapeutics development for  Operation Warp Speed , said advanced purchasing of potential Covid-19 therapeutics is much different than the advanced purchase of vaccines. “The therapeutic landscape is much wider,” Woodcock told a media briefing, adding there are multiple different modalities of therapy. With vaccines “it's very clear what you're going to do,” Woodcock said. “The primary goal is to vaccinate people and protect them… with therapeutics it's a little more complicated.” Woodcock said that advanced purchasing of therapeutics is going to be slower, because, “out of these vast inventories of potential candidates, we have to select the most promising ones. We can't just buy advanced purchases of 600 different agents.” Remember:  Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's Covid-19 vaccine program, has contracts to buy hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines from several different companies, including Moderna, AstraZeneca, Pfizer and others.  If any are shown to work safely to protect people against coronavirus, the advanced purchases mean the vaccines could be rolled out immediately without a wait time for their manufacture.

  12:48 p.m. ET, August 4, 2020 5 people test positive after event attended by Florida governor  From CNN’s Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tweeted this photo of himself speaking at a conference hosted by the Florida Sheriffs Association on July 27.  Gov. Ron DeSantis from Twitter 
  Five people at an event attended by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last week have tested positive for coronavirus, according to Nanette Schimpf, vice president of the Florida Sheriff’s Association. DeSantis  tweeted  a photo of himself speaking at the July 27 event hosted by the Florida Sheriff’s Association. One day after the gathering, an attendee told the association they had tested positive for Covid-19, according to Schimpf. All the participants were notified of the development, Schimpf said. “There is no indication that Governor DeSantis came in close contact with the individuals who have since tested positive for COVID-19. As the Governor noted during a press conference yesterday, he is tested regularly and does not have nor has had any symptoms,” the governor’s press office said in a statement. According to Schimpf, two sheriffs deputies, including Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood, and two department of corrections leaders issued statements about positive tests. About 60 people, mostly sheriffs deputies, attended the event. Schimpf said the group was following guidelines from the county, state and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of participants was reduced by 75% for the event, the trade show was eliminated and participants were required to wear masks in common areas of the hotel.
