  Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte plans to declare a nationwide public health emergency following confirmation of the country's first community transmission of the disease, the country's health minister said Saturday. 
  Francisco Duque told a news conference that the decision was a preemptive measure to prepare for a possible increase of cases.
  His comments came after health officials said the first case of the disease being transmitted locally had been recorded when a 62-year-old Filipino man who had not traveled abroad recently was diagnosed with the respiratory illness.
  His 59-year-old wife has also been infected, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the Southeast Asian nation to six.
