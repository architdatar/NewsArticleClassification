  Greece has quarantined a migrant camp after 20 asylum seekers tested positive for coronavirus, the migration ministry said on Thursday — its first such facility to be hit since the outbreak of the disease.
  Tests were conducted after a 19-year-old female migrant living in the camp in central Greece was found infected after giving birth at an Athens hospital last week. She was the first recorded case among thousands of asylum seekers living in overcrowded camps across Greece.
  None of the confirmed cases showed any symptoms, the ministry said, adding that it was continuing its tests.
  The country — often seen as  the gateway to Europe for people fleeing conflicts and poverty  in the Middle East and beyond — has reported 1,415 cases so far, and 50 deaths.
