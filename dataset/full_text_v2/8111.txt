  USA Swimming published  an open letter  Friday calling for the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics until next year. 
  "Our world class swimmers are always willing to race anyone, anytime and anywhere; however, pressing forward amidst the global health crisis this summer is not the answer," it said in the letter.
  Other national athletic bodies have also started raising concerns about holding the Olympics as scheduled from July 24 to August 9 and the Paralympics from August 25 to September 6. They include the British Olympic Association, the  British Paralympic Association , t he Norwegian Sports Federation and the Olympic and Paralympic Committee.
