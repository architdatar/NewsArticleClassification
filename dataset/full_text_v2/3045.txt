  President Trump vowed Thursday that he “will protect Medicare and Social Security” — a promise akin to one he made as a candidate in 2016. 
  But throughout his first term, he repeatedly tried to cut these programs in his proposed budgets.
  His fiscal-year 2018 budget (proposed in 2017) did not include proposed cuts to Medicare and Social Security,  but would have made cuts to Social Security Disability Insurance , which would have affected nearly 10 million people. 
  His fiscal-year 2019 budget (proposed in 2018)  proposed massive cuts to  Medicare, while his fiscal-year  2020 budget (proposed in 2019) proposed cutting  more than $1 trillion from Medicare over a decade, and $26 billion from Social Security programs.
  His fiscal-year 2021 budget (proposed earlier this year)  would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare  over 10 years.
  The reason none of the changes went into effect is that Congress controls U.S. spending, not the president. And the budgets for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are essentially  renewed annually, even without congressional approval. A president’s budget proposals are more akin to a picture of the administration’s priorities. 
  Additionally, the holiday on the payroll tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare, that Trump  implemented  via executive order earlier this s ummer  in an attempt to stimulate a struggling economy contributes to the depletion of the accounts that fund those entitlement programs.
  And Trump has said that  he would make “permanent cuts” to the payroll tax  — action that would require congressional approval — if he wins in November. Some experts have said that move could, in theory,  totally deplete Social Security by 2023 .
