  Saudi Arabia will enforce a countrywide 24-hour curfew during the five-day Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday later this month, to help stem the spread of the  coronavirus , the interior ministry said on Tuesday.
  The curfew will apply for the festival that follows the ongoing fasting month of  Ramadan . The kingdom has so far recorded 264 deaths — the highest number in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
  Nearby Dubai, the United Arab Emirates' business and tourism hub, began easing measures on Wednesday. It re-opened public parks and will allow hotel guests to access private beaches, state media said. Mosques, cinemas and nightclubs remain closed.
