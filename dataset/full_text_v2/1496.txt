  Iran began reopening government offices and businesses Saturday after a brief nationwide lockdown to help contain the  worst virus outbreak in the Middle East , which has killed more than 4,300 people in the country.
  Government offices outside the capital, Tehran, reopened Saturday with two-thirds of employees coming in and the remainder working from home, state media reported. Women who have young children were given priority in deciding who works remotely.
  Businesses in Tehran will be allowed to reopen next Saturday, provided they register with authorities and follow guidelines on social distancing.
  For many weeks, Iran had declined to impose the kind of wide-scale lockdowns adopted by other Middle Eastern countries, even as the number of confirmed cases and fatalities steadily climbed. Authorities have defended their response, saying they have to consider the economic impact of any quarantine measures  since the country is under severe U.S. sanctions .
