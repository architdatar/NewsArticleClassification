  Patients who've endured ongoing  COVID-19 symptoms  are working to raise awareness of the long-lasting effects of the illness by petitioning public health groups. 
  A grassroots effort was published Monday on  change.org , targeting the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.K.'s National Health Service, to "revise the recovery guidelines to reflect a more accurate recovery time to ensure patients are receiving the appropriate care, attention, and respect during their difficult road to recovery."
  Some patients, even those who were never sick enough to be hospitalized, have reported  fever, fatigue  and other symptoms for as many as 10 to 12 weeks.
  Some public health groups and physicians have begun to discuss setting up registries of people who have recovered, or who are still recovering from COVID-19, to get a better sense of long-term symptoms. There is no indication yet, though, when such a registry would be established.
