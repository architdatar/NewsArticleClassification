  The coronavirus death toll in New York state has reached above 10,000, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Monday. He reported an additional 671 deaths in the state, bringing it's total to 10,056.
  But the governor shared "good news" at his Monday morning press conference as well, saying "the curve continues to flatten," and that "it appears we have a plateau."
  Cuomo also noted what he called encouraging numbers of people coming off ventilators and leaving Intensive Care Units around the state.
