As parts of the U.S. continue to suffer through surges of new confirmed COVID-19 cases, a USA TODAY study found Tuesday that almost half of all states are spiking at a faster rate than they had been in the spring.
  Idaho, for example, is adding 20 new COVID-19 cases per hour after it was adding five in early April. This comes as many states have been forced  to pause or roll back their plans  to reopen their economies in order to mitigate the transmission rate and not overburden health care capacity. 
  Also on Tuesday, the Infectious Diseases Society of America offered public support for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top expert on infectious diseases, after reports emerged over the weekend that the White House distributed opposition research against Fauci.
  On Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany denied launching a campaign to discredit Fauci.
  Florida, meanwhile, saw its four-day stretch of new single-day cases of at least 10,000 snapped Tuesday but reported a record-high of new single-day COVID-19 deaths with 132.
  Gov. Ron DeSantis has blamed increased testing for the surge of new cases. 
  "We have to address the virus with steady resolve. We can’t get swept away in fear," DeSantis said Monday at a news conference. "We have to understand what is going on, understand that we have a long road ahead.”
  Some recent developments:  
  📈 Today's stats:  The U.S. has surpassed 3.4 million cases with over 136,000 deaths, according to  Johns Hopkins University . Globally, there have been 13.2 million cases and over 575,000 deaths.
  📰 What we're reading:  Los Angeles and San Diego schools are going online-only in the fall. Will other districts' reopening plans defy President Donald Trump and  do the same ?
  A candidate vaccine against COVID-19 developed by the federal government and Moderna, Inc.,  appears to be safe and to trigger an immune response , according to data released Tuesday from an early phase trial.
  But whether that immune response is enough to protect someone from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 remains unclear, according to several experts who reviewed the results.
  Moderna's chief medical officer Dr. Tal Zaks said although the protective effect of their vaccine can't technically be known yet, all indications are that mRNA-1273 will be safe and effective.
  Zaks said the levels of protective antibodies produced by the trial participants were similar to those found in patients who had recovered from COVID-19, suggesting that the candidate vaccine provides the same protection as an infection. Animal studies also show that mRNA-1273 can protect mice against infection, he said, and trials in primates and Syrian hamsters are underway.

  The first confirmed case of a mother transmitting the coronavirus to her unborn baby  has been reported in France , according to a case study published Tuesday.
  French doctors said in the peer-reviewed journal  Nature Communications  that a 23-year-old woman was admitted to the Antoine Béclère hospital in Paris with a fever and a cough when she was more than 35 weeks pregnant.
  She tested positive for COVID-19 and gave birth to her baby by cesarean section. Presence of the virus also was found in the boy.
  After testing positive, the newborn recovered and was discharged from the hospital 18 days later.

  Some of Philadelphia's most iconic events, including the 2020 Thanksgiving Day and 2021 New Year's Day Mummers parades, as well as the Philadelphia Marathon and Broad Street Run  are among the latest events to be canceled  because of COVID-19.
  Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced Tuesday the cancellation of all large events on public property for six months due to coronavirus concerns.
  The moratorium on publicly-advertised events on public property lasts until Feb. 28, 2021, the mayor said. 
  Indoor events are capped at 25 people and outdoor events are capped at 50, Kenney said.

  President Donald Trump's administration agreed on Tuesday  to rescind its controversial rule  barring international students from living in the U.S. while taking classes online, a sharp reversal that came after the White House faced a slew of lawsuits challenging the policy.  
  A Massachusetts judge announced the decision during a federal court hearing in a case filed last week by Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Judge Allison D. Burroughs said the universities' request for a preliminary injunction blocking the rule was moot because the government had agreed to rescind the policy. 
  "The Government has agreed to rescind the July 6, 2020" policy, the clerk's notes from Tuesday's session say. 
  The Trump administration's about-face came a day after 18 state attorneys general sued the Department of Homeland Security over the rule, which would have forced foreign students to leave or face deportation if they were only enrolled in online classes this fall.

  About half of American states are adding COVID-19 cases significantly faster than they did in the spring as many states were shutting down, a USA TODAY study found.
  Idaho added about five COVID-19 cases per hour in early April. By the middle of May, it was adding less than one case per hour; now it’s adding about 20.
  Other states and territories adding cases at rates far above their spring peaks: Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.
  Individual states and even parts of states have had dramatically different progressions with the coronavirus, as outbreaks that ravaged the Northeast have lulled as Sunbelt states surged.
  Arkansas and Wisconsin never had much in the way of peaks or lulls; instead, they’ve been steadily increasing. About six states and Puerto Rico are marking levels above spring’s peak, but not dramatically so.
  Most states in the Northeast are far below their spring peaks.

  Florida  reported a record 132 additional COVID-19-related deaths Tuesday , surpassing the previous high of 120 set July 9. The seven-day average for deaths statewide increased to 81.14, more than double the average on July 1 (38.43).
  According to the Department of Health, the state added 9,194 novel coronavirus cases Tuesday, snapping a streak of four consecutive days with more than 10,000 new cases reported. That brings Florida's cumulative number of cases to 291,629. The state had reached a record high for new confirmed COVID-19 cases Sunday with 15,300, the most any state has reported in a single day since the pandemic started.
  Tuesday was the 21st consecutive day with at least 5,000 positive cases. 
  The record-breaking daily death total increased the overall toll to 4,409 resident deaths statewide.

  After reports emerged over the weekend of the White House conducting a campaign to discredit Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Infectious Diseases Society of America issued a statement Tuesday offering public support for Fauci.
  “The only way out of this pandemic is by following the science, and developing evidence-based prevention practices and treatment protocols as new scientifically rigorous data become available," said Dr. Thomas File, president of the IDSA. "Knowledge changes over time. That is to be expected. If we have any hope of ending this crisis, all of America must support public health experts, including Dr. Fauci, and stand with science.”
  Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the country's top expert on infectious diseases,  said he hasn't briefed President Donald Trump  in two months.
  In response to accusations of a campaign intended to discredit Fauci with opposition research, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Monday "it couldn’t be further from the truth" and that Fauci and Trump "have always had a very good working relationship."
  France marked Bastille Day with a relatively quiet ceremony at the eastern end of the Champs-Élysées. For the first time in 75 years, the annual military parade down the hallowed boulevard to mark the storming of the Bastille fortress in 1789 was canceled. More than 30,000 have died in France, and the country is experiencing a surge in new cases. President Emmanuel Macron said he wants masks to be required in all indoor public places starting Aug. 1.
  "We will be ready in the event of a second wave," Macron said.
  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian, in a stark contrast to most of his rivals, says the airline  might not have to lay off any workers  despite the crushing coronavirus pandemic. Bastian said more than 17,000 employees, or almost 20% of Delta's 90,000 employees, have accepted early retirement offers and thousands more have agreed to voluntary unpaid leave in the fall. Last week, United warned that up to 36,000 of its employees face layoffs, though its ultimate number will depend on voluntary programs, too. Other airlines are also bracing for heavy fall layoffs as the payroll protections from the CARES Act end.
  "I’m optimistic if we do have a furlough, it’s going to be relatively minimal numbers,'' Bastian said Tuesday on CNBC.

  Four of the first group of cadet candidates who arrived on campus at the United States Military Academy to begin basic training  tested positive for COVID-19  and will spend their first weeks either in isolation or quarantine on campus. Lt. Col. Robert Kinney said the four were screened as part of their reception day Sunday. The 1,200-member class has been brought to campus on three reception days, called "R Day." Cadets began arriving Sunday and the entire class begins military training Wednesday.

  A 42-year-old Tennessee physician who was infected with the coronavirus at a meeting about how to keep the coronavirus from spreading has a  passionate message for all to hear  –  wear a mask, avoid crowds and protect yourself and those around you. Dr. Daniel Lewis was hospitalized in isolation and spent 10 days unconscious while hooked to a breathing machine. When he finally awoke, he was plagued by hallucinations, blood clots and muscle atrophy that left him unable to walk, eat or go home.
  "You don’t have to be elderly,” Lewis said. “It’s an apolitical virus that can strike anyone. While there are certain risk factors that may predispose some people to being more ill than others, it can strike people like myself that otherwise were healthy.”

  Just when many shopping malls had finally figured out how to adapt to the era of digital retail, the  coronavirus pandemic is upending everything . Malls had turned to dining, entertainment, fitness and personal services – a pivot that was supposed to help them survive the Amazon age. But now they face mall anchor J.C. Penney struggling to avoid liquidation, smaller retailers closing or requesting rent relief, and venues such as theaters still temporarily shut down. The result: One in four malls to one in two could go out of business altogether, analysts projected.
  Half the nation's malls could be shut down “if we can’t stop the bleeding,” Coresight  Research CEO Deborah Weinswig told USA TODAY. “That ends up changing the face of America.”

  The coronavirus pandemic has tacked on hundreds of millions of dollars  in unexpected costs to this year’s election . Dozens of interviews with local election clerks, state officials and advocates by USA TODAY Network, Columbia Journalism Investigations and the PBS series FRONTLINE reveal the country’s patchwork election system is fraying. And a proposal to provide states an additional $3.6 billion in federal money to support cratering election budgets has yet to be voted on by the U.S. Senate. One Chicago nonprofit donated $6.3 million to five Wisconsin cities to help with their elections costs.
  "Local jurisdictions are literally relying on philanthropy to help pull off this election," said Nathaniel Persily, an election law professor with Stanford Law School. "It's like we are holding a bake sale for our democracy."

  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo defended a state Health Department report that declined to blame thousands of nursing home deaths on a controversial Cuomo administration directive requiring facilities to take in COVID-19 patients. The report instead suggested workers and possibly visitors unwittingly spread the virus.
  Cuomo said “ugly politics” were behind “this political conspiracy that the deaths in nursing homes were preventable.” Some experts are less certain. Charlene Harrington, a professor emerita of nursing and sociology at the University of California at San Francisco, said it appeared the "Department of Health is trying to justify what was an untenable policy."
  The Health Department, early in the crisis, had ordered nursing homes to admit “medically stable” coronavirus patients discharged from hospitals that were overwhelmed by patients. More than 6,000 nursing home residents died. ProPublica reported that New York’s nursing homes suffered a larger percentage of deaths relative to its total nursing home population than several states that did not have such a policy.
  A Mexican man being held in U.S. immigration custody in Florida died shortly after testing positive for the coronavirus,  officials said Monday . 
  Onoval Perez-Montufa, 51, died Sunday afternoon at a Palm Beach County hospital, according to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement news release. He had tested positive for COVID-19 on July 2 at the Glades County Detention Center in Moore Haven, which is west of Lake Okeechobee. Medical staff at the facility began treating him a day earlier after he complained of shortness of breath.
  Perez-Montufa initially entered ICE custody June 15 following his release from federal prison in Massachusetts, where he had served 12 years for cocaine distribution. He was in ICE custody pending his removal to Mexico.
  A Salvadoran man died in May after testing positive for coronavirus at a San Diego, California, ICE facility. A Guatemalan man died later that month at a Lumpkin, Georgia, facility.
  Will Florida schools reopen?  COVID-19 separated this school board member from her preemie. She plans to vote against reopening. 
  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the state will send testing and contact tracing teams to Atlanta as the city's COVID-19 cases continue to rise.
  "Mayor Bottoms, we've been watching you and what you've been going through," Cuomo told Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms in a  joint video conference  Monday. "Anything we can do for you, for the city, we stand ready."
  Bottoms responded: "Thank you Governor, and that's exactly what we need assistance with. Testing that gets people results very quickly, and also the contact tracing because we know that's extremely important for us to help slow the spread."
  New York was once the nation's epicenter of the pandemic. On Sunday, New York City health officials reported that no one died from the virus in the city on July 11. Cuomo said Monday that air travelers from states with high rates of COVID-19 must provide their local contact information or face a penalty of up to $2,000.
  Hawaii extends its quarantine until Sept. 1 
  Hawaii is  delaying its plan to allow out-of-state visitors to return  to the vacation hot spot by a month because of an increase in coronavirus cases in the state and on the mainland U.S.
  In late June, the governor's office announced that travelers could visit Hawaii beginning Aug. 1, no quarantine required, by presenting a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of boarding. Without one, passengers arriving from the mainland would have to strictly quarantine for 14 days, a policy in place since March that has scared away most tourists and decimated Hawaii's tourism industry.
  Hawaii Gov. David Ige said at a news conference late Monday that the program won't begin until Sept. 1, a decision he said was not taken lightly.  "We have always said that we will make decisions based on the health and safety of our community as the highest priority,'' Ige said.
