  Dogs have been trained to detect a range of illnesses, from ovarian cancer to bacterial infections, and now scientists are hoping they can be used to sniff out COVID-19. 
  Using a process called odor imprinting, the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine is aiming to train dogs to discern the differences between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients, the school said in a  news release .
  Dr. Cynthia Otto of the  @PennVetWDC  will lead a study to see if scent detection dogs can tell the difference between  #COVID19  + and - patients. Drs. Ronald Harty and Andrew Vaughan are also conducting COVID research at Penn Vet. Read about the study at  https://t.co/VTK0RQfpLn   pic.twitter.com/0hNbbJPlET 
  "The potential impact of these dogs and their capacity to detect COVID-19 could be substantial,"  Dr. Cynthia Otto , a professor of Working Dog Sciences and Sports Medicine who is leading the study, said.
  Over a three-week period, which researchers hope to begin as early as July, eight dogs will be exposed to COVID-19 positive saliva and urine samples in a laboratory setting. Once they become familiar with the odor, scientists will see if the dogs can distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative samples in the laboratory setting. If the dogs are able to differentiate between the samples, researchers hope that means the dogs will be able to identify COVID-19 infected people.
