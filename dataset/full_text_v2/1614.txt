  Some students at the London school attended by the U.K.'s  Prince George and Princess Charlotte  have stayed home as they await test results for coronavirus, NBC News has confirmed.      
  Although the exact number of children staying home is not known, Thomas's Battersea school remains open.
  It is unclear whether the son and daughter of Prince William, Britain's second in line to the thrown, and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, have stayed home. George, 6, and Charlotte, 4, are the great grandchildren of Queen Elizabeth II.      
  Most London schools are asking students who have visited China or other areas impacted by the virus to stay home if they exhibit any flu-like symptoms.
