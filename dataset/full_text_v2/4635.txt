  Police enforced lockdowns across large parts of India on Tuesday, with curfews in place in some areas, as domestic air travel was set to end at midnight.
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepared to  address the nation on Tuesday  for a second time in a week on the risks that coronavirus poses to the country of 1.3 billion people.
  India has already severed international flight links and Indian states have imposed their own lockdowns, suspending train and bus services and ordering traffic off the roads. Health officials have warned that the coronavirus is spreading out of big cities where it first appeared and into smaller towns.
