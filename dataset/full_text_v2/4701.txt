  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said President Donald Trump has agreed to dispatch a floating hospital called the USNS Comfort to help with the coronavirus crisis.
  The Navy ship, which Cuomo said has 1,000 beds and operating rooms, will be berthed in New York harbor.
  “This is literally a floating hospital,” Cuomo said. “The president said he will dispatch that immediately.”
