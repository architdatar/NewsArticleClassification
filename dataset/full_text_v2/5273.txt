  A 10th person in the U.S. has died from the coronavirus, Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday.
  "Word this morning from the CDC is that one more American has expired and their family has our condolences," Pence said during a White House meeting. "Ten Americans have succumbed to this disease."
  "We all grieve the loss of American lives," he said.
  Pence did not say where the death occurred. All previous nine deaths were in Washington state.
