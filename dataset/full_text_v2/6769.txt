California is the most populous US state and is the country's largest state economy. US travel advisory:  The US State Department has issued a worldwide Level 4: Do Not Travel Advisory due the coronavirus pandemic. In the US, there are at least 13,133 cases of the virus, and 195 deaths. Italy death toll:  The total number of fatalities reported in the country at the new epicenter of the outbreak has now  surpassed China's  death toll.

  Mainland China reported 39 new cases of coronavirus -- all imported from overseas -- and three new deaths as of end of day Thursday, according to the country's National Health Commission. This brings the death toll in mainland China to 3,248 and total confirmed cases to 80,967. Thursday is the second day China has reported no increase in domestically transmitted coronavirus cases. It is also the second day no new confirmed cases were reported in Hubei province, the epicenter of the pandemic. Concerns over a so-called "second wave" of infections have increased in recent days as the number of imported cases -- linked to overseas travel -- have risen throughout Asia.  In China, authorities have escalated  quarantine measures on international arrivals  to avoid further outbreaks. And in the capital, Beijing, all passengers arriving from overseas are now required to go into "collective quarantine at designated facilities." Beijing residents were previously allowed to quarantine themselves in their own homes.

Gavin Newsom's announcement, 21.3 million California residents were already under a "shelter in place" order.  “There's a recognition of our interdependence, that requires of this moment that we direct a statewide order for people to stay at home,” Newsom said, speaking of those who were already told to stay home.  “We were confident, we are confident, that the people, the state of California will ... do the right thing,” he added. 
  When does the order go into place?  The order will go into effect today and will remain in place until further notice. What's closed?  Dine-in restaurants, bars, nightclubs and gyms will be shuttered. Public events are also banned  What will still be open?  Gas stations, pharmacies, banks, food stores, and laundromats will still be open. Essential state and local government functions will also remain open, including law enforcement and offices that provide government programs and services. Read more  here . And  here are more details  on what you can and can't do during a "shelter-in-place" order. Watch:

The news comes a day after the country issued fresh guidelines, banning all international commercial passenger flights from landing in India from March 22.  The directive will be in place for a week.  What other measures is India taking?  The Indian government is directing state governments to advise citizens above 65 and children below 10 to stay home. This excludes public representatives, medical professionals and government employees.  States have also been requested to enforce work from home for private sector employees, except those working in emergency or essential services. There are more than 190 confirmed cases in India and four deaths.

  9:02 p.m. ET, March 19, 2020 Mexico and Israel have evacuated citizens stranded in Peru. Americans are still waiting for help From CNN’s Taylor Barnes and Sharif Paget in Atlanta and Jennifer Hansler in Washington The Mexican and Israeli foreign ministers tweeted on Thursday that their respective nationals were on special flights exiting Peru. Peru announced a sudden border closure on Sunday that left many foreigners stranded. Peru has 234 reported coronavirus cases and one confirmed death. On Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz tweeted a video showing a cheering group of passengers, many wearing face masks, aboard a plane in Lima. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard retweeted Subsecretary Maximiliano Reyes Zúñiga, who wrote that a flight from Lima to Mexico City took off late on Thursday with 154 passengers aboard. The situation for Americans:  Meanwhile, Americans stranded in Peru have been calling on US authorities for help. A Google spreadsheet maintained by a user who says her father is among the passengers stranded in Peru currently has more than 1,600 entries for stranded Americans. Here's what President Donald Trump said about the Americans currently stuck in Peru at a news conference on Thursday:  “We're trying to get them out. And, you know, they got caught. They were late with their flights. We gave them a period of time. They didn't make it, but we're looking to get them out with military, probably through the military.” 
  Another way out?  However, information on the US Embassy in Lima’s website appears to suggest that private airline carriers could take the stranded Americans home. The Embassy published a link to an Avianca Airlines signup page for passengers in need of international flights and wrote that anyone interested in the offer “should respond immediately.” The Embassy also listed phone numbers for major airlines that operate flights between Peru and the United States. American students stranded in Cusco, Peru told CNN on Thursday that they are eager for the US State Department to assist them in returning home. “Bring us home,” student Erin Hill told CNN: “Thank you (State Department) for the work and hours you’re putting in. Everybody here wants to get home.”
