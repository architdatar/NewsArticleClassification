  Montana Gov. Steve Bullock raised the lack of supplies including both personal protective equipment and testing capabilities on a phone call with President Trump and other governors, a source familiar tells CNN. The New York Times first reported that Bullock, a Democrat, told Trump "officials in his state were attempting to do 'contact tracing' — tracking down people who have come into contact with those who have tested positive — but they were struggling because 'we don’t have adequate tests.'” According to the Times, Trump responded saying, “I haven’t heard about testing in weeks,” and told the governors “We’ve tested more now than any nation in the world. We’ve got these great tests and we’re coming out with a faster one this week.” He added, “I haven’t heard about testing being a problem.”
