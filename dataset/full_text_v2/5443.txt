  🚨: “Covid-19 is the greatest test that we have faced together since the formation of the United Nations,”   António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, said on Wednesday, according  to the New York Times .  
  ‘A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH’:  President Trump and his top public health advisers delivered grim news last night that the novel  coronavirus  could cause 100,000 to 240,000 fatalities in the U.S. — even in a best-case scenario with robust mitigation efforts. 
  Trump, along with Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, a physician coordinating the coronavirus task force, encouraged Americans to be disciplined about staying home over the next 30 days. 
  Fauci warned that domestic and international models assume full compliance with stay-at-home orders and  still  predict a death toll nearly double that of Americans  who died  during the entire Vietnam War. But they're “going to be doing everything we can to get it even significantly below that” number. 
  There was a glimmer of good news:  The modeling shows California and Washington, which implemented early aggressive efforts to curb the spread of the virus, have prevented a spike in cases. But Trump warned “a very tough two weeks” lie ahead.  “I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead.” 
  Moving the goalposts:  Trump's dire warnings stand in stark contrast  to the months in which he downplayed  the severity and risk of covid-19, the disease caused by this coronavirus.  In a two-hour news conference last night, the president tried to frame the possibly enormous loss of 100,000 to 200,000 Americans as the best possible outcome against a vicious enemy. 
  The lengthy news conference in which Fauci and Birx revealed data modeling the grim projected death toll showcased a president who has now said his top priority is saving American lives.  But the administration is still hesitating to take some steps that could help scared Americans — for instance, it won't reopen enrollment for Affordable Care Act exchanges to help Americans who may lose their health insurance along with their jobs. 
  Fact check:  The president, who yesterday claimed he “knew everything” about the virus and that “it could be horrible,” compared it to the flu saying it would “go away” as recently as the second week of March: 
  O ur colleagues Harry Stevens and Shelly Tan  traced  “the winding path of the president’s response to the virus, in his own words.” Even as the World Health Organization warned of high global risks and states starting reporting cases of community transmission, Trump ignored the severity of the spread of the disease. 
  We really recommend  taking time to scroll through the graphic itself . It can be easy to forget just how much has happened in just 70 days.
  “As cases increased and stocks tumbled, the president’s attitude toward the threat of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has evolved from casual dismissal to reluctant acknowledgment to bellicose mobilization,” Harry and Shelly report.  
  HEADLINES FROM THE HOT SPOTS:  
  NEW YORK: 
  Besieged hospitals are struggling with life-or-death decisions:  “Several hospitals have taken the unprecedented step of allowing doctors not to resuscitate people with covid-19 to avoid exposing health-care workers to the highly contagious virus,”  our colleagues Ariana Eunjung Cha, Lenny Bernstein, Frances Stead Sellers and Shane Harris report .
  New York is just trying to hang on:  “It’s impossible at this juncture to quantify the damage to an industry that generates tens of billions of dollars in revenue. The short- and medium-term prognosis for public gatherings — the veritable circulatory system of live performance — is so uncertain that arts organizations are scrambling to figure out what to salvage and what to abandon,”  our colleagues Peter Marks and Geoff Edgers report from New York .
  NEW JERSEY: 
  Deaths in the Garden State rose to 267, the largest single-day increase,  according to NJ.com. 
  LOUISIANA: 
  State sees largest spike in 24-hour period:  “Reported infections and deaths each jumping about 30 percent,”  our colleagues David Montgomery and Richard A. Webster report  from New Orleans.
  New Orleans police officers are still jailing people for minor offenses:  “This business-as-usual approach endangers the police, the community and inmates, public health experts say,”  our colleagues Richard A. Webster, Emma Brown and Kimberly Kindy report  from the city.
  MICHIGAN: 
  “On Monday, Detroit reported 1,804 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of 50 – including state representative Isaac Robinson, 44, who died from the virus on Sunday,”  reports  The Guardian.
  ILLINOIS: 
  Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) extended the stay-at-home order through the end of April, the Chicago Tribune  reports. 
  THE LATEST FROM THE DMV:  “A day after leaders in the District, Maryland and Virginia ordered residents to stay home to limit the spread of the virus, the greater capital region added 477 known coronavirus cases, bringing the regional tally to 3,411,”  our colleagues Gregory S. Schneider, Rebecca Tan, Rachel Chason and Erin Cox report .
  Other key developments: 
  Bowser doesn't expect D.C. to enforce stay-at-home order with a heavy hand:  “D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said she does not expect the city to levy criminal penalties for violating her stay-at-home order, which allows the city to jail people for up to 90 days or fine them up to $5,000,”  our colleague Fenit Nirappil reports .
  What's going on at the Kennedy Center?!:  The center received $25 million, controversially in some eyes, under the coronavirus stimulus bill. But then days later, musicians at the National Symphony Orchestra were told their paychecks would cease April 3. More furloughs were announced on Tuesday,  our colleague Peggy McGlone reports . 
  The sale of Trump's D.C. hotel is on hold:  “As of Monday, seven of the Trump Organization’s 10 top-grossing properties were closed. Those that remained open were at a fraction of their usual capacity: Trump’s hotels in Chicago, New York and Washington had all closed their bars and restaurants in response to local orders,”  our colleagues Jonathan O'Connell and David A. Fahrenthold report .
  DOJ WATCHDOG FINDS MORE ISSUES WITH FBI SURVEILLANCE:  “The Justice Department inspector general revealed that his investigators found errors in every FBI application to a secret surveillance court examined as part of an ongoing review,”  our colleagues Devlin Barrett and Ellen Nakashima report .
  This suggests the problem was much bigger than Carter Page:  “The memorandum issued by Inspector General Michael Horowitz stems from an audit launched last year after his office found 17 serious problems with the FBI’s surveillance applications targeting former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. These interim results seem to indicate that other sensitive counterintelligence and counterterrorism cases have been similarly plagued by mistakes,” our colleagues write.
