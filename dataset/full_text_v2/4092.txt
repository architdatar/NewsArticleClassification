  London could now have as few as 24 new coronavirus infections a day, according to analysis from a team of  Cambridge University researchers . Working with Public Health England, the researchers analysed current data up to May 10 to plot the progress of the virus.
  Their model shows that the British capital — England's worst impacted region — is estimated to have had 1.8 million infections since the outbreak began. However, the "R rate" in that area is now the lowest in the country at just 0.4, meaning that 10 infected people will only pass on the virus to four others. In contrast, there are still over 4,000 new cases a day in the Northeast and Yorkshire region of the country where the R is twice as high at 0.8.
  England made its first tentative steps  toward easing its seven week lockdown Wednesday, with people who can't work from home urged to return to work. Residents were also given permission to go outside as often as they would like, and to meet one other person from a separate household in a public outdoor space.
