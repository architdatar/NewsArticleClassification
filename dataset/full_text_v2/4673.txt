  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday said he tested negative for COVID-19. 
  "It is peace of mind," he said.
  Cuomo received a nasal swab test for the coronavirus during his daily press briefing Sunday. 
  "There is no reason why people shouldn't be getting tested," he said Monday. "If you have any symptoms, get a test."
