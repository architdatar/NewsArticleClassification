  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday that he's postponing his state's primary that was scheduled for April 28 to June 2. 
  "I am issuing a proclamation to postpone the April 28 primary to June 2, just as a number of  other states have done  and as other governors are expected to do later today or in the days ahead," he said at a press conference.
  "I am directing the state board of elections to develop a comprehensive plan by April 3 to conduct the primary election in a way that protects public health and preserves the integrity of the democratic process in our state," he said.
