  Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday criticized the New York Police Department and Mayor Bill de Blasio over the law enforcement response to looting and vandalism in parts of New York City on Monday night.
  "The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night," Cuomo said at a news conference. "I believe that."
  The NYPD is the largest police department in the United States, the governor said, adding, "I don't believe they have used enough police to address the situation."Â 
  The governor said multiple times that the city's police force has 38,000 members. According to the  NYPD's website , it employs about 36,000 officers.
  Cuomo said the NYPD has protected the city before in similar situations.
  "I've seen them do it before. I know they can do it because I have seen them do it," he said. "They did not do it last night, but I believe in the inherent capacity of the NYPD if managed and deployed."
  He added, "That's what I think hasn't worked and that has to be fixed and it has to be fixed today. Stop the looting. I do believe that the NYPD well-deployed would not need the National Guard."
