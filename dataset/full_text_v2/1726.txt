  Uber said in a memo Friday that it plans to compensate drivers and delivery workers who are required to self-quarantine, or if they are diagnosed with the coronavirus.
  Employees “in these situations” will receive compensation for a period of up to 14 days, Senior Vice President Andrew Macdonald said in a statement, although he did not say how much they would receive. 
  “This has already begun in some markets and we are working to implement mechanisms to do this worldwide,” he added.
