  Facebook will not participate in the annual media and music event South by Southwest because of fears of the novel coronavirus, the company said Monday.Â 
  "Due to concerns related to coronavirus, our company and employees will not be participating in SXSW this year," a Facebook Company spokesperson said in an email.
  The withdrawal  was reported by Business Insider  earlier Monday.
  Featured speaker Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey  announced Sunday  that he would be withdrawing after his company enacted a ban on non-essential travel.
  South by Southwest, known as SXSW, is scheduled to be held in Austin, Texas, in mid-March.
  Organizers  said in a statement  that they are working closely with local, state and federal agencies and that they are proceeding with the event. Organizers said that the health and safety of its attendees, staff and volunteers are a top priority.
  "At this time, there are a handful of cancellations from participants who were traveling from China and Japan and there have been a few corporate travel bans. Other than that, the cancellations are on par from past years," organizers said in a statement.
  The statement said that participants are encouraged to follow personal hygiene practices, including washing hands and covering coughs, among other measures.
