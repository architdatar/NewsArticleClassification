  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that he spoke to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Friday morning about the next piece of legislation that Congress could consider to aid struggling states in the coronavirus fight.
  Pelosi is working on boosting financial assistance to states in the next measure and Cuomo said she “fully understands” the needs of state and local governments. Cuomo said that he will work with the speaker and New York’s congressional legislation on what his state needs from federal relief legislation. 
  “She understands my position on how New York was short-changed in the last bill,” Cuomo said during his daily news conference in Albany. 
  New York's death toll hit 2,935 as of Friday, an increase of 562 deaths.
