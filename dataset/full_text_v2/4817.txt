  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Saturday that by 6,000 of the city's homeless residents, mostly single adults, will be moved out of shelters into hotels by April 20.
  "We think that is the right balance to strike to get people to stay safe" from coronavirus infection, the mayor said during a press briefing.
  Over 300 homeless people in the city have tested positive for the virus, and atÂ least 20 have died from the disease, according to city data released Friday.
