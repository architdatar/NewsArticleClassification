  Pennsylvania continues to have some of the highest totals of the coronavirus in the nation, with the state health department reporting 1,599 new cases on Friday, bringing the statewide total to 38,652.
  The number of deaths increased to 1,492, an additional 71 from the day before, health officials said.
  Meanwhile, Gov. Tom Wolf on Thursday  announced a three-phase plan  for the state's economy, with a target date of May 8 for an easing of some orders and restrictions, including allowing certain businesses to reopen. The economic toll on the key swing state has been striking, and some  political strategists have suggested  that President Donald Trump won't have it easy there in November.
