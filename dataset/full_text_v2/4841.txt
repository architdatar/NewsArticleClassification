  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he is extending the state's shutdown to May 15.
  "What happens after then? I don't know," Cuomo said at a news conference Thursday. "We will see depending on what the data shows."
  The governor said the decision to "unpause" New York "is going to be an ongoing process that we're working through with other states" in the region.
  Cuomo also said he received some complaints about his order this week requiring New Yorkers to wear masks or face coverings in public.
  "I'm sorry it makes people unhappy," the governor said. But, he said, he doesn't consider the order "a major burden, and it really is a simple measure that can save lives."
  "Remember, it's not just about you, right?," he said. Others have rights. "And you have a right for another person to take reasonable safeguards not to get infected."
