  Senior medical students at NYU received an email about the decision on Tuesday night.
  “With the growing spread of Covid-19, our hospitals (are) inundated with patients, and our colleagues on the front lines working extra-long hours, we are still short-staffed in emergency and internal medicine,” the school���s deans said in the email.  
  NYU administrators are currently gauging student interest with a survey and waiting approval from state and education boards.
  Medical schools in Italy and the United Kingdom have already given the option to fast-track students into doctors. 
  By the numbers:  New York has been hit hard by the virus, with over 30,000 cases statewide and 285 deaths.  
  
  
  With additional commercial and private labs coming online, the number of Californians getting tested for coronavirus has tripled. 
  About 66,800 tests have been completed so far, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said, about 39,000 more than Tuesday.
  Results are still pending on more than 10,000 coronavirus tests, the governor said. As officials work to procure more, one company is promising results in just 10 minutes, another in 45 minutes.
  A task force is working to vet those companies to ensure the state is not being taken advantage of, Newsom said.
  Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is asking President Trump to issue a major disaster declaration for the entire state due to coronavirus.
  Parson hopes a declaration like this would "provide federal assistance for state and local Covid-19 pandemic preparedness and emergency response efforts," the governor's office said in a news release.
  Missouri has been in a state of emergency since March 13. There are eight confirmed deaths in the state due to coronavirus.
   
  
  
  The State Department is tracking 50,000 Americans who might seek assistance in returning to the US, the head of the State Department’s repatriation task force said Wednesday. A dramatic increase from an estimated 13,500 Americans on Monday.
  The number is more than triple the figure the State Department was tracking just two days ago. On Monday, a senior State Department official said they were looking at approximately 13,500 Americans abroad who were seeking US assistance.
  Brownlee, who heads the Department’s repatriation task force, said Wednesday that they had repatriated “over 9,000 people from some 28 countries.”
  “We're planning on another 66 flights over the next nine days or so,” he said. “We have some 9.000 people scheduled – identified for those flights and we hope to move those numbers up.”
  
  
  California has distributed 24.5 million N95 masks and has placed orders for another 100 million more, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced at a news conference Wednesday. 
  Some context:  Describing the "Herculean effort" underway, the governor said it is taking shape and noted that British billionaire Richard Branson has committed to a 747 airplane, and that Elon Musk has given 1,225 ventilators.
  New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell is  asking  for "clean scrubs" because she said Tulane Hospital is running low on supplies.
  In a series of tweets, she asked the community for donations of “matched sets of green cotton surgical scrubs.” 
  Cantrell said the donations, which are going to a group called “Supplies for Saints,” will be for health care workers on the frontlines of the epidemic.
  Refuting the mayor's tweets, Tulane Hospital told CNN an attempt to sanitize scrubs may have been misinterpreted.
  "Tulane Health System currently has an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to meet patient demands, and that includes scrubs," the hospital said.
   
  CNN's Phil Mattingly is answering your questions on the Senate stimulus package. There's not a clear answer on if college students will qualify for stimulus checks. Here's why, according to Mattingly:
  The Colorado Hospital Association is warning that without social distancing, hospitals across the state may not be able to meet the demand for ICU beds.
  Lonborg points to a 2018 count of ICU beds across the state that shows Colorado has 973 ICU beds and 10,293 total hospital beds, but warns, “it should be understood that the 2018 numbers reported in this spreadsheet are the baseline, not the current level of ICU and CCU beds in the state, which will now be higher.”
  As it confronts the initial surge of Covid-19 patients, Lonborg said that CHA is currently assessing the number of ventilators across the state.
  “So when we know that number, we will have to ask: do we have a model to help us understand what the need may be so we have enough? And if we don’t have enough, how far off are we?” Lonborg said.
