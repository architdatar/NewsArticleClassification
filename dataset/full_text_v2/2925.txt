  Not even the first family of the country's largest state is safe from the public's crazed run on toilet paper.
  Jennifer Siebel Newsom, wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said on Twitter  that one "rose amidst all this" is that her husband and children have enjoyed "family dinners and no late night homework stress." 
  "And yes, unfortunately the thorn – we run out of toilet paper, paper towels, and Kleenex tomorrow," she tweeted Wednesday. "I wish people had not hoarded."
