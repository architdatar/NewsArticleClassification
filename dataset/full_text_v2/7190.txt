  6:27 p.m. ET, April 14, 2020 Trump halts US funding to World Health Organization   From CNN's Elise Hammond U.S. President Donald Trump and World Health Organization (WHO) DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom AFP and Bloomberg 
  President Trump announced Tuesday he is halting funding to the World Health Organization while a review is conducted. Trump said at a news conference the review would cover the WHO’s “role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of coronavirus.” The President said that while the US imposed travel restrictions on China during the early stages of the outbreak, WHO was "opposed to what we did," he said. "Other nations and regions who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic around the world," Trump said. 
  Trump continued: "The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days."

In a video shared by Dyson today, the company showcased its latest development, highlighting that engineering teams and manufacturers have been working “around the clock” to develop this new ventilator.  “Dyson and TTP have worked together to develop an entirely new design of ventilator in record time for the clinical needs of COVID-19 patients,” Dyson said.  
  The video continued : “The project has brought together engineers, scientists, medical device designers, clinical testing and high technology manufacturing knowledge, to achieve the NHS specification." In March, a spokesperson for Dyson told CNN that they hoped to have the ventilators ready for mass production by early April 2020.

  6:14 p.m. ET, April 14, 2020 Prosecutors ask judge to postpone Rudy Giuliani's associates' trial due to coronavirus pandemic From CNN’s Kara Scannell Prosecutors are asking a federal judge to postpone the trial of  associates of Rudy Giuliani  by at least four months until February due to the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the criminal justice system. In a letter to Judge Paul Oetken, prosecutors also said they informed lawyers for Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and two other men charged in a campaign finance scheme that their plans to bring additional charges against the men have also been impacted.  The “timeline for seeking a superseding indictment has been pushed back due to issues involving the availability of witnesses and grand jurors given the pandemic-related travel and social-distancing restrictions,” prosecutors wrote.  Parnas and Fruman had been schedule to go to trial on October 5, about one month before the presidential election. The men, who were central players in Giuliani’s effort to dig up dirt on Joseph and Hunter Biden’s activities in the Ukraine, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.  The coronavirus pandemic has ground the criminal justice system to a halt across the country with grand juries disrupted and criminal and civil trials postponed. In the Southern District of New York trials are postponed until at least June 1.   Prosecutors didn’t object to a request by lawyers for the defendants who sought to postpone the trial because of their difficulty of meeting with their clients, who are based in Florida and California, and prepare for trial. If the trial is delayed, it would remove the potential for information about Giuliani’s associates spilling into the public just weeks ahead of the presidential election. Other high profile trials have also been postponed. Michael Avenatti, the celebrity attorney, was set to go to trial this month on charges he stole more than $300,000 from his former client Stormy Daniels. A federal judge set a new trial date for August.  Paul Manafort's lawyers have also asked for the former Trump campaign chairman to be  moved out of prison  due to potential health risks from the coronavirus.

  5:53 p.m. ET, April 14, 2020 Connecticut governor says other state leaders find Trump's May 1 reopening "very premature" From CNN's Keith Allen Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont  CNN 
  Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said that he and a number of his gubernatorial counterparts think President Trump is off-base with his desire to reopen the nation’s economy by May 1.  “President Trump has put out the date of May 1, which I think most of the governors think is a very premature,” Lamont said at a news conference. “I just showed you that hospitalizations are going up and infections are going up, and this is no time to take our eye off the ball.” 
  Lamont instead reiterated the May 20 date he offered on CNN's New Day Tuesday morning as more of a realistic timeframe when he could make an informed decision about when to reopen the state.  “I said we're not gonna be reopening schools before May 20, but by May 20 we're gonna have a lot of our testing in place by then, we'll have a lot more of the PPE, the protective gear,” Lamont said. “And that will give us a lot stronger indication about who and when and how people can start getting to work.���

  5:50 p.m. ET, April 14, 2020 California health director: "We are not out of the woods yet" From CNN's Cheri Mossburg  CNN 
  California’s health director told CNN that the state is not completely ready to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic. “We are not out of the woods yet, but we are cautiously optimistic,” Dr. Sonia Angell, California’s health director, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room." 
  “This is the right time to start talking to Californians about what it might look like as we start loosening restrictions," she added. Angell noted that there are a number of quick indicators that will help leaders make decisions to proceed and that it’s time to start modifying orders in a way that's safe for Californians. "We're not sure this is the end of it, but it's a good moment to take stock and look at what it might look like as we get back to normal," Angell said. The new normal will be about creating space for people to safely leave their home but keeping those with greater risk at home, she said. Watch:

  5:41 p.m. ET, April 14, 2020 French study finds hydroxychloroquine doesn’t help patients with coronavirus From CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and Dr. Minali Nigam A pharmacist shows a bottle of the drug hydroxychloroquine on Monday, April 6, in Oakland, California. Ben Margot/AP 
  A drug that’s been touted by President Trump as a “game changer” didn’t help hospitalized patients with coronavirus, and was associated with heart complications, according to a new study.  “This provides evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not apparently treat patients with Covid-19,” said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “Even worse, there were side effects caused by the drug – heart toxicities that required it be discontinued.” The study was published Tuesday on a pre-print server and was not peer reviewed. In the study, among the 84 patients who took hydroxychloroquine, 20.2% were admitted to the ICU or died within seven days of inclusion. Among the 97 patients who did not take the drug, 22.1% went to the ICU or died.  The difference was determined to not be statistically significant. Looking just at deaths, 2.8% of the patients who took hydroxychloroquine died, and 4.6% of the patients who did not take it died. That difference was also found to not be statistically significant.
