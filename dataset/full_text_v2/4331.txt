  Louisiana, one of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic,  will allow its stay-at-home order to expire  on Friday and will loosen other lockdown restrictions this weekend, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced on Monday.
  The first phase of the state's reopening on Friday will draw back certain restrictions currently impacting churches, restaurants, salons and gyms, officials said.
  Louisiana has struggled to contain COVID-19,  the disease associated with coronavirus, which might have been inadvertently fueled by New Orleans'  annual Mardi Gras celebration . For example, as of Monday afternoon there had been at least 2,242 virus-related deaths in Louisiana, a state with 4.6 million residents. Compare that to about 2,712 fatalities in California, a state with nearly 40 million residents.
  Edwards' orders have been  in place since March 23 .
