  People waited a safe distance apart from one another on Thursday as they lined up in a supermarket in the Italian city of Florence as the nationwide lockdown continued.

  "There are very few people outside, and all walking," Francesco Corti, 49, told NBC News by phone Thursday, adding that people were "respecting" the distance between one another to try to avoid the spread of COVID-19, which killed 200 people in Italy on Wednesday alone. 
  "It’s pretty funny because you know the Italians love to stay very close to each other. It’s not happening these days," he said, adding that most people were remaining calm and trying to follow the government's advice. 
  He also said he had not seen panic-buying at the supermarket.
