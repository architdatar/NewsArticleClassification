  A Boone County, Missouri, resident who went to a bar that  was criticized  for having a crowded pool party over Memorial Day weekend has tested positive for COVID-19, health officials said.
  The resident, who was not identified, was in the Lake of the Ozarks area on Saturday and Sunday and went to several places, including Backwater Jack's, the bar that  had a pool party  where video showed little social distancing.
  The Camden County Health Department said in a statement that the person developed illness on Sunday, so they were "likely incubating illness and possibly infectious at the time of the visit."
  A  timeline was released  "due to the need to inform mass numbers of unknown people," the health department said. It shows the person went to Backwater Jack's twice on Saturday, another pool that day, and a Buffalo Wild Wings on Sunday.
  Camden County is the county where the bar is located, and Boone County where the person lives is north of Lake of the Ozarks.
  Backwater Jack's has defended the party, saying that not socially distancing is not a crime, that temperature checks were conducted and sanitizer was available, and that it is a seasonal business that has already been badly impacted by the restrictions related to the epidemic.
