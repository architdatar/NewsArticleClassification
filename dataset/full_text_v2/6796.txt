  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned again Wednesday that the national lockdown would continue for weeks to come even though the country has, so far, been spared the worst of Covid-19. "If we reopen too soon, everything we're doing now might be for nothing,” Trudeau said during his daily press conference in Ottawa. Canada reported 28,205 cases on Wednesday and 1,008 deaths. Nearly half of those deaths were related to outbreaks in long-term care facilities. Still, per capita, Canada has had fewer cases and deaths than the United States and most European countries. But Trudeau says that doesn’t mean the country is reopening anytime soon, and certainly not by May 1. "It would be terrible if we were to release restrictions too early and find out we're suddenly back in another big wave of Covid-19," he said, adding that any reopening would happen in phases.

Ned Lamont will issue new guidelines for wearing masks in public spaces which will "likely be reflected in an executive order within 48 hours," he said in a news briefing in Hartford on Wednesday.  Lamont said the decision came after consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  "It's time for us to be also really strict about the need to wear a mask, even masks you make yourself, just a bandana, a scarf, or a surgical mask," he said.

  5:00 p.m. ET, April 15, 2020 Pelosi says testing inadequacies are "almost sinful"   Source: CNN 
  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she thinks any discussions on reopening the economy must be based on health care and science.  "The numbers are staggering but each individual story is heartbreaking to hear. So as we have discussions about how we open up our economy, this or that, we understand that this is an assault on the lives and the livelihoods of the American people, and that any decision to open up would be one that should be science-based and health-care-based," she told CNN. Pelosi went on to say that's why testing is critical. She added that more than a month later, the US still doesn't have "the appropriate, adequate testing" to identify the challenge. "So really we have been delinquent. We have to have a change in that," she said. "It's one thing to say well, it wasn't done right. But there's no excuse for us to not do it right as we go forward. It's so obvious. Almost sinful."

  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday an executive order mandating face coverings in public for people in retail establishments or riding on public transportation.  The order comes on the heels of Maryland’s deadliest 48 hours of the pandemic, with 87 people reported dead so far this week. Hogan urged leaders in Washington “to put aside partisan politics” and warned that without additional federal action states could face “devastating” consequences. “We’ve asked the Trump administration to support the governors and states, and ask for their help in breaking this logjam in the US Senate so that we can continue working together to fight this pandemic and to get our states and our economies back on track,” Hogan said. 
  Maryland now has 10,032 confirmed Covid-19 cases, and 311 deaths, according to a  tally  from Johns Hopkins University.

  4:20 p.m. ET, April 15, 2020 California governor announces assistance plan for undocumented workers From CNN's Cheri Mossburg California’s undocumented workers who have been forced out of work as a result of the pandemic will be eligible for payments in a new private-public partnership announced by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The workers are not eligible for federal stimulus payments. Undocumented workers make up about 10% of California’s workforce, Newsom said. Because these workers pay approximately $2.5 billion in state and local taxes, Newsom has signed a Direct Disaster Assistance order, which will provide up to $500 for individuals and up to $1,000 for families. The state will provide $75 million to fund the program and private philanthropists will give $50 million. Some philanthropic foundations that have signed on to donate include the Emerson Collective, the Zuckerberg Chan Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, and Blue Shield Foundation.
