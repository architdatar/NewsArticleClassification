  Health officials in Santa Clara County, California, on Saturday confirmed a fourth case of coronavirus.
  The patient is an adult woman who is "not ill" and has not been hospitalized, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department said. She was described by officials as a "household contact" of the third case in Santa Clara.  
  The third case was described last week by  public health officials  as an older woman with chronic health issues. She had not traveled out of the country nor come into close contact with a known carrier of the virus.
  Santa Clara County officials said in a statement that they are bracing for more cases and are preparing for "community spread," a term used when someone is infected but the source is unknown.
