LOUISVILLE, Ky. – A United Parcel Service employee working in Kentucky died over the weekend, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday during his coronavirus briefing.
  "We are aware of a UPS employee that has died," Beshear said. "However they are an individual that resided in Clark County, Indiana, which is why they're not on our list — even though I believe they were in Kentucky."
  UPS spokesman Jim Mayer said the company "offered a statement of condolence about an employee who passed away this weekend," but declined to provide more detail.
  "We are not identifying him and are not confirming cases of coronavirus due to medical privacy concerns," Mayer said.

  Other companies, such as  GE Appliances ,  Ford  and  Brown-Forman , have confirmed cases of the coronavirus at their plants.
  Mayer added that "UPS is saving lives, saving jobs and has been deemed critical for national security by the federal government," and that the company is working with Beshear, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and President Donald Trump.
  He also said that the company has added shuttle buses to allow for social distancing, is cleaning its vehicles and spaces and is distributing cloth face masks to employees.
  With its Worldport Hub at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, UPS is the largest job provider in town — employing more than 20,000 full- and part-time workders at its facilities in the area.
