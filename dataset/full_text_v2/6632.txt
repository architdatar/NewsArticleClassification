  12:20 p.m. ET, April 30, 2020 The UK has passed its coronavirus peak, Boris Johnson says From CNN's Rob Picheta in London Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson chairs his first digital Cabinet meeting on Thursday since returning to work after contracting coronavirus and the birth of his new son.

  Boris Johnson has said the UK is "past the peak" of its coronavirus outbreak and is looking towards a lockdown exit strategy, as he led the British government's coronavirus briefing for the first time since recovering from Covid-19. "We're past the peak and we're on the downward slope," Johnson said. "We can now see the sunlight and the pasture ahead of us." He added that he would set out a "comprehensive plan" next week to outline the government's plans on restarting its economy, re-opening schools and enabling Britons to travel to work. But he cautioned against easing restrictions too early, which could cause a second peak and lift the virus's reproduction rate above 1 -- meaning the average person with Covid-19 would infect more than one person on average.  Johnson said that another 674 people had died from coronavirus in the UK in the past 24 hours. But he said more than 81,000 tests were carried out over the past day. This is by far the highest daily number to date -- and a vast increase on the country's testing rates just a few days ago. The government had set a target of carrying out 100,000 tests by the end of April, although testing figures only include tests where a result has been confirmed, so it is not yet clear whether that has been reached. The Prime Minister also admitted the UK has faced "logistical problems" in getting personal protective equipment to frontline health workers, and "frustrations" in scaling up testing. "We are throwing everything at it, heart and soul, night and day" to get it right, Johnson added.

  12:33 p.m. ET, April 30, 2020 Italy will reopen based on how the virus has spread regionally, prime minister says From CNN's Valentina di Donato  The empty streets of Rome are seen on April 2. Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images 
  The Italian government will slowly relax the coronavirus lockdown measures based on how the contagion spreads in different regions of the country, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said today. “Reopening of activities would be based on precise scientific criteria," he said during an address to Parliament. Conte's comments come as 13 out of the 20 Italian regions have asked the government to reopen certain activities, through a joint letter delivered on Wednesday. Lombardy, the region affected most by the coronavirus outbreak, is one of the signatories.  The letter, published by the governor of Veneto, asks the government “to guarantee the possibility of reopening activities to all those who respect the measures already provided" by the government decree. “It's clear that health is the first essential objective, but it can’t be the only one,” the letter read. Restaurants, bars, and shop owners around Italy are “handing over their keys" to their mayors in protest against the government. Many shop owners fear that the longer the lockdown will last, the harder it will be to reopen.  On Thursday, the Italian Health Minister is expected to publish a series of measures defining the guidelines and thresholds to evaluate the evolution of the contagion in each area of Italy.

  10:01 a.m. ET, April 30, 2020 UK won't "gamble away" coronavirus progress by easing restrictions too soon, official says from CNN's Luke McGee  Dan Kitwood/Getty Images 
  The UK government is not going to “gamble” away the sacrifices people have made by easing coronavirus restrictions too soon, the Prime Minister’s official spokesperson said. He says people need to be “realistic” about the situation given that the virus will be around for a significant time. “We don’t want to relax the social distancing measures or do anything that could cause the virus to spread again,” the spokesperson said. “People have made huge scarifies. We’re not going to gamble those sacrifices away by taking steps that could lead to a growth in the disease again,” adding that the government will continue to be guided by the scientific advice.

  9:17 a.m. ET, April 30, 2020 Swedish town dumps chicken manure in park to deter visitors From CNN's Zahid Mahmood and Henrik Pettersson  Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency/AFP via Getty Images 
  The Swedish town of Lund has “dumped” 1,000 kilograms of chicken manure — or about 2,200 pounds — in the city’s main park to deter gatherings and prevent the town from becoming an “epicenter of coronavirus,” Lund’s Mayor Philip Sandberg told CNN on Thursday. The city’s Environment Committee said on Tuesday that the Lund City Park will be closed for "maintenance measures" on Walpurgis Day, a holiday starting on Thursday in northern Europe.  Sandberg told CNN they would finish the manure "dumping" on Thursday and while the park and its surrounding area will smell for several days, it was necessary for fertilization as the manure will not only deter visitors, but also get the lawn ready for the summer.  “It will stink of chicken manure and won’t be pleasant for people to be around, but the chicken has a lot of phosphorus and nitrogen in so the park will be nice just in time for the summer,” Sandberg said. 
  While Sweden has banned gatherings of more than 50 people, Sandberg said in Lund they are trying to get people to social distance as much as possible as it is proven “parks can carry a severe risk to coronavirus.” “We don’t want to become an epicenter for coronavirus so we are doing what we can to fertilize the lawn and keep people safe," Sandberg added. “It has been proven that parks can carry a severe risk to coronavirus with the amount of people gathering in them, so this is an important measure for us to take, whilst getting the lawn ready for better weather.” He added that the public’s reaction to this has been positive because they too understand it will be “worth it.”

  9:10 a.m. ET, April 30, 2020 A third of hospitalized Covid-19 patients die in the UK, study shows  From CNN's Milena Veselinovic and Jacqueline Howard A large-scale new pre-print study has found that a third of coronavirus patients admitted to UK hospitals die, and fewer than half of those put on ventilators survive. The study, called ISARIC4C and led by researchers from the University of Edinburgh, University of Liverpool, and Imperial College London, analyzed data from 16,749 Covid-19 patients in 166 UK hospitals between February 6 and April 18. It found that 49% were discharged, 33% died and 17% continued to receive care at date of reporting. The study also showed that of patients put on a ventilator, 53% died, 20% were discharged, and 27% remained in the hospital. Researchers also found that, along with underlying issues such as lung, heart and kidney disease that are already known to worsen outcomes, being male or obese were also significant factors associated with Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals. This could be because obese people have a reduced lung function and potentially more inflammation in the fatty tissue under the skin and around internal organs, which could contribute to a possibly life-threatening overreaction of the body's immune system, researchers said. Remember:  The study, which was funded by the UK government, has not yet been peer-reviewed. Derek Hill, Professor of Medical Imaging, University College London (UCL), called the research "extremely impressive" but warned that it shows a "snapshot of outcomes" and that many patients who were included are still in hospital, so the mortality and survival rates are subject to change. "This is an especially large study so it provides helpful insights into the symptoms of Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital. As has been reported many times, this is not like flu in who gets seriously ill or in mortality: young children seem to have low risk and pregnant women do not have an increased risk of serious illness, and it is deadlier than flu," Professor Hill said in a written statement released by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Wednesday.

  A Spanish doctor was struggling to cheer up his 79-year-old coronavirus patient. Pedro had tested positive for Covid-19 five times and had symptoms for 46 days. The doctor reached out to Twitter for help, seeking encouragement from any corner for Pedro. "He is despondent and ready to throw in the towel," Dr. Carlos Hernandez Teixidó wrote on Tuesday. “Twitter, do your magic.”  The response was immediate, global and overwhelming. He received 8,100 replies to his post alone, many more direct messages, more than 29,300 likes and it had been retweeted more than 7,900 times. “I have just spoken to Pedro and his daughter," Hernandez said on his Twitter account less than 24 hours after his initial post. "You don’t know how moved both of them were (sic). I have given his daughter the first 300 messages.” The doctor added, “You are incredible!” 
  In total, Hernandez received more than 15,000 direct messages for Pedro, he told CNN on Thursday. “Not just messages, put people have sent pictures, videos, some even played music to try and cheer him up.” “We decided to post the tweet to try and get around 15 people to send him a message to lift his spirits,” Hernandez said, confessing he was very surprised at the outpouring of support. “We posted it at 3 o’clock in the afternoon and by midnight we had 300 messages, including from some celebrities in Spain.”  The messages came not just from Spain, but from neighboring Portugal and from other places in Europe as well as Latin America. For a time, the phrase “Hola Pedro” (or, "Hello Pedro,") even became a trending topic on twitter in Spain. According to Hernandez, Pedro has several underlying conditions and had spent around a month in the hospital after being diagnosed. His condition improved, but since the Covid-19 tests kept coming come back positive, he had to continue isolation at home, without seeing his wife or the rest of his family. “I spoke with him a little bit today and he is in very good spirits,” Hernandez said, explaining that for people in Pedro’s situation, this sort of support “is almost like providing treatment with a drug.” But the doctor added that while Pedro’s condition has improved his most recent test – the sixth – also came back positive for Covid-19.

  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he expects the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency-use authorization for remdesivir soon to treat Covid-19.  Speaking Tuesday during an appearance on the Today show, Fauci said that while the FDA has not made a final decision yet, he projects "it’s going to be really quickly.” Fauci said he believes Gilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, is committed to make the treatment available "as much as they can, as quickly as they can." "I'm pretty confident that will be the case because I believe they're committed to trying to get this out as quickly as possible," Fauci told NBC's Savannah Guthrie. What this is about:  A trial of the experimental drug remdesivir showed it  might help patients recover more quickly  from the infection.  Yesterday, Fauci was optimistic about the results, saying "The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery." However the World Health Organization said it's too early to comment on the remdesivir trial results released Wednesday.

  Tom Moore, a British war veteran, has raised over $38 million for public health care from his fundraising activities.  More than 1.4 million people have so far contributed to the appeal on his JustGiving page, for which Moore pledged to walk 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday to raise money for the UK’s National Health Service. On Thursday, as Moore celebrated his 100th birthday, he was promoted to an honorary Colonel of the British Army in recognition of his efforts. The veteran also received a birthday card from Queen Elizabeth II.

  12:38 p.m. ET, April 30, 2020 US goal to manufacture coronavirus vaccine by January is possible, Fauci says From CNN Health's Jacqueline Howard  Alex Brandon/AP 
  The Trump administration's program to accelerate the development of a potential coronavirus vaccine, called "Operation Warp Speed," has the goal to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses by January -- which is in the realm of possibility, according to the nation's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci. In a Thursday morning appearance on the Today Show, Fauci said that he is part of the team involved in that project. "We're in the early phases of a trial -- Phase 1. When you go into the next phase, we’re going to safely and carefully, but as quickly as we possibly can, try and get an answer as to whether it works and is safe. And if so, we’re going to start ramping up production with the companies involved," Fauci told NBC's Savannah Guthrie on Thursday. "You don’t wait until you get an answer before you start manufacturing -- you ... proactively start making it, assuming it’s going to work, and if it does, then you can scale up and hopefully get to that timeline," Fauci said. "So we want to go quickly, but we want to make sure it’s safe and it’s effective. I think that is doable." 
  Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, previously has said that a coronavirus vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop. The United States currently has the timeline of developing its vaccine by the end of the year. "Remember go back in time, I was saying in January and February that it would be a year to 18 months," Fauci said. "January is a year -- so it isn't that much from what I had originally said."
