  Governors across the country on Sunday criticized President Donald Trump's expression of solidarity with those  protesting  various state-issued stay-at-home orders, saying his comments are "dangerous" and "don't make any sense."
  "I don't know any other way to characterize it, when we have an order from governors, both Republicans and Democrats, that basically are designed to protect people's health, literally their lives, to have a president of the United States basically encourage insubordination, to encourage illegal activity," Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, told ABC's "This Week."
  He added, "To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law, I can't remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing."
  Inslee said Trump's comments were "dangerous" because they "can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives."
