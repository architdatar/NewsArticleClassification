  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday railed against President Donald Trump for  saying it would be unfair to Republicans if Congress passes coronavirus bailouts  for states because he said the states that would benefit from that funding are run by Democrats.
  "The president is playing politics while people are suffering," de Blasio said. 
  “Who cares who runs the states? The people need help! There are American that need help right now," the mayor said. "Do you not care about that firefighter, that EMT, that paramedic, that police officer, that health care worker because they live in a state run by a democrat, or a city run by a democrat? Does that make them less American in your view Mr. President?" 
  De Blasio said Trump "seems to enjoy stabbing his hometown in the back," and added that it was hypocritical that the president is against bailouts "given how much money he’s put in the hands of the corporations and the wealthy." 
  Trump said in his interview with the New York Post Monday that "Florida is doing phenomenal, Texas is doing phenomenal, the Midwest is, you know, fantastic." But de Blasio on Tuesday held up a letter signed by 111 Democrat and Republican Texas mayors asking for more federal coronavirus aid.
