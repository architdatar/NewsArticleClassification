  One third of National Health Service staff and other key workers who’ve been tested for coronavirus have returned positive results, according to data released by the British government. According to the figures released Monday,  16,888  people who fall into the category of “key workers and their households” have been tested. So far,  5,733  – or 34% -- are confirmed to have the virus. The government has been under pressure to ramp up testing for NHS workers and their families, amid concerns about a lack of appropriate personal protective equipment.  Health minister Matt Hancock has previously said that NHS staff who show symptoms -- or live with someone who does -- will be able to get tested under the government’s plan, with the ultimate goal to provide testing to all NHS staff regardless of symptoms.

Nearly another month of lockdown for India:  Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  has  extended a nationwide lockdown  until May 3 in a bid to contain the continued spread of the  coronavirus , but said that some states which have avoided outbreaks may be allowed to resume "important activities." The "complete" 21-day lockdown for India's 1.3 billion people came into force at the end of the day on March 24 and was set to expire today.

France is extending coronavirus emergency measures until May 11, President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday. Singapore's biggest spike:  The Southeast Asian city-state reported 386 new cases on Monday -- all locally transmitted. It's the largest single-day increase since the outbreak began in the country, according to the Ministry of Health. Positive signs in the United States:  Though the situation differs from state to state, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the country is "nearing the peak right now." Cases in the US have  topped 582,000 , including more than 23,000 deaths. New York preparing for what's next:  New York Gov.

  3:26 a.m. ET, April 14, 2020 Acting US intelligence chief shares Instagram post appearing to mock stay-at-home orders From CNN's Alex Marquardt and Paul LeBlanc Acting US Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell on Monday shared a meme that appeared to mock the enforcement of  stay-at-home orders  in the US despite the overwhelming consensus of public health officials that such measures are crucial to slowing the coronavirus' spread. On his  Instagram  account, Grenell posted the meme that features an image of the US Constitution with the caption "signed permission slip to leave your house." "Love this!" Grenell captioned the post. That message directly contradicts recommendations put forth by public health experts and government agencies -- including Grenell's own office.

  As the world watches and wonders when coronavirus pandemic stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures might end, some hope antibody tests might help provide a solution. Antibody tests -- also known as serology tests -- aren't meant to diagnose active infection with the coronavirus. Rather, they check for proteins in the immune system, known as antibodies, through a blood sample.  Their presence means a person was exposed to the virus and developed antibodies against it, which may mean they have at least some immunity -- although experts are not sure how strong the immunity may be or even how long it will last. In contrast, diagnostic testing, so far, has mostly used a laboratory technique known as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. These tests can diagnose active infections through a sample -- usually from a nose swab -- that is then tested for viral genetic material. Read more:

  The International Monetary Fund will provide immediate debt relief to 25 member countries that have requested financial assistance as they deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said Monday. The countries receiving the grants are among the IMF's "poorest and most vulnerable members."  They are:  Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Togo and Yemen. The funds will be used "to cover their IMF debt obligations for an initial phase over the next six months and will help them channel more of their scarce financial resources towards vital emergency medical and other relief efforts," Georgieva said. 
  The IMF trust responsible for the funds can provide $500 million in "grant-based debt service relief." In her statement, Georgieva urged donors "to help us replenish the Trust’s resources and boost further our ability to provide additional debt service relief for a full two years to our poorest member countries.”

  In a normal year, China would have sold more than 6 million new cars by now. This year, the number is closer to 3.7 million, and now the government is handing out cash to help the  world's biggest auto market  get back on its feet after the  coronavirus  pandemic. Car sales declined 42% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to last year, according to data released late last week by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  While that is largely because of a whopping 79% plunge in February -- when the country of 1.4 billion people recorded just 310,000 sales -- the market remains very weak. Only 1.43 million vehicles were sold in China last month, a 43% decline over March 2019. Crucial economic role:  More than 40 million people in China rely on the auto sector for jobs, either directly or indirectly. And the more than $1 trillion in revenue the industry generates each year contributes to nearly 10% of China's manufacturing sector. A healthy Chinese car market is also important to the rest of the world. Global automakers like Volkswagen and General Motors sell millions of cars in China -- each of those companies, for example, depend on the country for roughly 40% of their total sales.

  2:07 a.m. ET, April 14, 2020 WWE deemed an essential service, returns to live televised shows From CNN's Amanda Jackson Professional sports in Florida are getting the green light to resume production after the Florida Governor's Office deemed them "essential services." This is being added to the same list that includes services such as grocery stores, hospitals, banks, utility companies and restaurants. The  order that was signed on Thursday  states that employees at professional sports and media production with a national audience can continue only if the location is closed to the general public. This essential service was added because it is critical to Florida's economy, officials told CNN. World Wrestling Entertainment resumed live televised shows on Monday after weeks of taped matches, including their  biggest event of the year, WrestleMania.  The organization is producing new content for fans with the use of their training facility in Orlando. "We believe it is now more important than ever to provide people with a diversion from these hard times," WWE said in a statement to CNN. "We are producing content on a closed set with only essential personnel in attendance following appropriate guidelines while taking additional precautions to ensure the health and wellness of our performers and staff."

  1:48 a.m. ET, April 14, 2020 Trump rages at criticism while governors craft their own plans to reopen the economy Analysis by CNN's Stephen Collinson and Maeve Reston President Donald Trump speaks during the daily briefing on the novel coronavirus in the Brady Briefing Room at the White House on April 13.

  With 23,000 Americans dead and millions without a paycheck,  President Donald Trump  dimmed the lights in the White House briefing room,  fired up a misleading propaganda video and boiled over . In one of the most unchained presidential tantrums ever captured on television, Trump's Monday display flouted every notion of calm leadership by the commander in chief in a crisis. He claimed powers never envisioned by the Constitution and insisted his "authority is total" to order states and cities to get moving again to break out of the frozen economy. His warning came as two blocs of Eastern and Western hot-spot states banded together in an implied challenge to his vow to get people back to work soon, setting off a brewing confrontation over the power of the federal government. During the news conference, Trump moaned that the press was not giving him credit because "everything we did was right" in the  coronavirus pandemic . Raging at reporters, the President used the campaign-style video to mislead the nation about his sluggish recognition of the threat from the virus, after once predicting a "miracle" that would make it go away. He called up his top medical adviser,  Dr. Anthony Fauci , to publicly repudiate his own words Sunday on CNN, which had been interpreted as criticism of early administration actions. When the Category Five presidential storm had blown out, Trump had offered no new guidance on the key issues -- for instance, the continued inadequacy of testing, which will hamper the nation's economic opening. He vowed that the economy would fire up "ahead of schedule" but did not explain how, when many states are at or are approaching their peak infection rates. And he appeared to warn he would try to force open state economies, including shops, schools and restaurants closed by governors and mayors. He did not explain, either, how he would convince the public to get back to normal if people did not feel confident they were safe. "The President of the United States calls the shots," Trump said.
