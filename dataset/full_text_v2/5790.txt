  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY, applauded the  Trump administration’s response  to the coronavirus, saying, “There seems to be little question that COVID-19 will eventually cause some degree of disruption here.” 
  And McConnell criticized Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, for criticizing the funding request by President Trump, calling it “a strange and clumsy effort to override normal, bipartisan appropriations talks before they even happen and replace them with top-down partisan posturing.”
  McConnell said that the bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are working on a funding package in response to the WH request, and is hoping to pass it through Congress in the next two weeks.
