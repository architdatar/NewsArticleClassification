  Pope Francis said on Saturday to a small audience at his Vatican morning mass that he was praying for health care workers helping disabled COVID-19 patients.
  He said that he had received a letter from a nun detailing the difficult situation facing nurses and doctors treating disabled people.
  "We pray for those who are always at the service of people with with different abilities, who don't have the abilities we have," he said.
  Italy's healthcare system has been hit particularly hard by the outbreak, but the country, along with others in Europe are now consider lifting lockdown measures.
