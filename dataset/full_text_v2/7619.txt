President Trump 's  coronavirus  test came back negative, meaning he does not have the virus, according to the White House physician.
  "Last night after an in-depth discussion with the President regrading COVID-19 testing, he elected to proceed," Dr. Sean Conley said in a release. "This evening I received confirmation that the test is negative."
  "One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom-free," he added. "I have been in daily contact with the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are encouraging the implementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation."
  Trump  had revealed  earlier Saturday  that he took the  coronavirus  test and was awaiting the results.
  The New York Times was first to  report  that the president tested negative for COVID-19 on Saturday night.

  "I also took the test," Trump had said in the White House briefing room. "I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday. People were asking that I take the test."
  Trump has been in contact with individuals who have later tested positive with COVID-19, sparking questions on whether the president should be hand-shaking, quarantined and tested.
