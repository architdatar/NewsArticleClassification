  Tokyo’s Olympic 2020 contract allows it to postpone the Games until the end of the year, Japan’s Olympics minister said Tuesday, amid concern the coronavirus could disrupt the event.
  “The contract calls for the Games to be held within 2020. That could be interpreted as allowing a postponement,” Seiko Hashimoto said in response to a lawmaker’s question in parliament.
  However, she added that the governments of Japan and Tokyo were still committed to keeping to the scheduled start date of July 24. And under the hosting agreement, the right to cancel the Games belongs to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
  Thomas Bach, head of the IOC, reiterated Tuesday that preparations were still underway for a “successful” Games in Tokyo.
