  President Donald Trump on Sunday approved a major disaster declaration in Washington State in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the White House said.
  In a statement, the White House said the approval frees up extra federal funding  for the hard-hit state , where nearly 1,800 cases of the disease have been confirmed and 94 people have died.
  The funding will be available for virus-related crisis counseling, the White House said.
  The statement added that funding is also available for emergency protective measures like direct federal assistance.
