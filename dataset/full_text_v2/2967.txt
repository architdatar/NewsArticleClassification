  Facebook has canceled its yearly F8 developer conference, one of the company's signature events.
  “This was a tough call to make -- F8 is an incredibly important event for Facebook and it’s one of our favorite ways to celebrate all of you from around the world -- but we need to prioritize the health and safety of our developer partners, employees and everyone who helps put F8 on,” Facebook's director of platform partnerships,  Konstantinos Papamiltiadis , wrote in a blog post.
  Papamiltiadis wrote that the company is planning to host a series of local events and livestreams in place of the event.
