  President Donald Trump threatened to adjourn both chambers of Congress on Wednesday, lashing out at lawmakers for holding up nominees to federal judgeships and key administration roles amid the pandemic.  
  "The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony Pro Forma sessions is a dereliction of duty," Trump said. 
  Trump said that hundreds of nominations have been stalled in the Senate, which is not slated to meet until April 20 and has been holding pro form sessions, which are generally brief meetings in the chamber.
  The House is not expected to meet until May 4. Both chambers have managed to hold sessions and pass legislation related to the pandemic.
