  Jazz patriarch Ellis Marsalis died in New Orleans after contracting coronavirus, his son told the Associated Press on Wednesday.
  The 85-year-old developed pneumonia and ultimately succumbed to that pulmonary infection, which was triggered by the virus, Ellis Marsalis III said.Â 
  Marsalis was a jazz pianist and educator whose sons includeÂ trumpeter Wynton, saxophonist Branford, trombonist Delfeayo and drummer Jason.
  In 2006, after Hurricane Katrina tore through his hometown, Marsalis joined the effort toÂ  build Musicians' Village , a community of 72 homes in the Upper Ninth Ward neighborhood.Â The nonprofitÂ Ellis Marsalis Center for Music, a performance and education space, is now a centerpiece of the community.

  Ellis Marsalis was a legend. He was the prototype of what we mean when we talk about New Orleans jazz. The love and the prayers of all of our people go out to his family, and to all of those whose lives he touched. ðŸ“¸: Chris Granger/New Orleans Advocate  pic.twitter.com/yQTMk62wIm
