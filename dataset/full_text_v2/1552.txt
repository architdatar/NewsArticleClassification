  Almost half of doctors in the U.K. have relied upon donated or self-bought personal protective equipment and two-thirds still don’t feel fully protected from coronavirus, a new survey by the British Medical Association showed on Sunday.  
  More than 16,000 doctors answered the poll from the labor union which represents doctors in the U.K. It is believed to be the largest review of frontline National Health Service workers since the crisis began. As of Jan. 2020 there are a total of 125,308 doctors working for the country's National Health Service, according to its latest  workforce statistics .  
  “On the one-hand it shows how resourceful they have been and how much support there has been from the general public in providing kit; but far more importantly, it is a damning indictment of the government’s abject failure to make sure healthcare workers across the country are being supplied with the life-saving kit they should be,” Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA council chair said as the data was released.  
  The U.K. government has faced continued criticism from health workers over a  lack of sufficient protective gear , as well as complaints surrounding low levels of virus testing. Britain has so far reported more than 180,000 cases.
  Perhaps most distressingly, we heard that 65% of doctors felt only partly, or not at all protected from  #COVID19  at work. And 1 in 4 report worsening mental distress during the pandemic.  Read more on these results here  https://t.co/v5OzyvVGDZ  3/4
