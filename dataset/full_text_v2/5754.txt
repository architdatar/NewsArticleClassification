  Scotland reported its first case of coronavirus on Sunday after a resident in the country’s Tayside region tested positive, officials said.
  In a statement, Scotland's government said the patient had recently traveled to Northern Italy, a region that has been hit hard by the virus.  The country has reported  more than 1,100 confirmed cases and 29 deaths.
  The Scottish resident was isolated and began receiving treatment while investigators worked to trace their contacts, the statement said. Additional information about the patient's condition wasn't immediately available.
  Sunday’s test result was sent to a public health lab in England for additional confirmation.
