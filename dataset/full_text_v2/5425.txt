Pope Francis  tested negative for the  coronavirus  after falling  ill  last week, according to the Roman newspaper  Il Messaggero .
  After spending last Wednesday primarily outdoors, Francis came down with a cough, chills and other flu-like symptoms. He was tested for the disease which has spread from China throughout the world, including to Italy, but the results were negative.
