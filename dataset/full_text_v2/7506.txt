  5:54 p.m. ET, March 31, 2020 Trump says the federal government is holding back almost 10,000 ventilators From CNN's Matthew Hoye  Alex Brandon/AP 
  President Trump said that there are almost 10,000 ventilators being “held back” from distribution because “the surge is coming.” “We also are holding back quite a bit. We have almost 10,000 ventilators that we have ready to go. We have to hold them back, because the surge is coming and it's coming pretty strong and we want to be able to immediately move it into place without going and taking it, so we're ready to go," Trump said. 
  Trump previously said he thinks it would be difficult to get equipment back from states and redistributed once they have been issued to hospitals.

  Mark Anthony Spell, pastor of Life Tabernacle Church in Central, Louisiana, told CNN the doors to his church will be open on Sunday, despite charges Tuesday for violating the governor's executive order. Spell said that opening the church is no more risk than the hundreds of people going and shopping at stores. When asked why he will not follow the governor's mandate, Spell said: "We have a mandate from the word of the Lord to assemble together. The first amendment says that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the exercise of religion." 
  Spell said that officers came to him today and read him his rights. They did not arrest him. He said he was asked to stop having services and he told them that he would not stop. "We aren't breaking any laws," Spell said. "The doors to the church will be open on Sunday."

  Small business owners will be able to apply for loans to weather the economic downturn set off by Covid-19 on a first-come, first-serve basis beginning Friday as part of the newly-passed stimulus package. The Payroll Protection Program aims to provide $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses, to help them maintain employee payroll, make rent or interest payments on their mortgages, pay utilities or cover other overhead costs, according to administration officials. Businesses are expected to receive their checks within three weeks of applying, administration officials said.  Borrowers will be charged 0.5% interest as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to offer funding to small businesses so they continue operating during the current slowdown, according to the Treasury Department.  The new legislation also provides a “generous” processing fee that’s paid by the government for facilitating these loans to incentivized banks and other lenders to issue the loans, administration officials said Tuesday. Administration officials hope that the loans will help small businesses meet payroll and cover overhead, provide incentives for larger businesses to keep employees on the payroll, provide enhanced unemployment insurance for workers who are laid off and protect distressed industries that are critical for the country’s national and economic security.  All loan payments will be deferred for six months and receive a 100% guarantee from the Small Business Administration.

  5:19 p.m. ET, March 31, 2020 Planned Parenthood will comply with Indiana's order to cancel all elective or non-urgent procedures, including abortions From CNN's Rob Frehse Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky said they would comply with Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb’s  executive order  to postpone or cancel all elective or non-urgent procedures, including abortions, to conserve medical equipment. Holcomb said Tuesday that he would leave it up to a doctor to determine if postponing or cancelling any of those procedures would cause harm to the patient. “Any and all medical expertise and PPE first needs to go toward defeating Covid-19 in this window and the sooner the better for all of us,” he said.  Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky CEO Chris Charbonneau said they would comply with the governor’s directive but noted that their top priority is “ensuring that every person can continue accessing essential health care, including abortions.” “As Hoosiers do their part during this COVID-19 pandemic, Planned Parenthood is doing our part to conserve needed resources and protect the health and safety of our patients and staff. Together, we’ll meet this challenge, no matter what,” Charbonneau said in a statement to CNN.
