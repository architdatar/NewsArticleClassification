  6:35 p.m. ET, August 6, 2020 People should not wear masks with valves or vents, CDC says From CNN's Jen Christensen The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend people use masks with valves or vents during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to new mask recommendations on the agency’s “About Masks” section of its website. The one-way valves may provide the wearer more comfort, since the valves allow air to escape from the mask and can keep people cooler, but the valves also allow the virus to escape from the mask. The CDC encourages people to wear masks so they don’t infect others. Covid-19 spreads mainly through respiratory droplets when a person talks, sneezes, sings or coughs. Masks can help stop those respiratory droplets. Some context:  The CDC had recommended against using these masks in health care settings on its website earlier in the pandemic. Delta airlines’ mask policy spells out that the ventilated versions are not approved as an acceptable face mask for customers traveling on any Delta operated flight.

  6:34 p.m. ET, August 6, 2020 Former surgeon general says it's "very dangerous" to give specific dates on a potential Covid-19 vaccine From CNN's Shelby Lin Erdman It’s “very dangerous” to give specific dates on when a coronavirus vaccine may be available, former US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Thursday. President Trump said Thursday he was “optimistic” a potential coronavirus vaccine could be ready by Election Day on Nov. 3. “When it comes to a vaccine, all of us are hoping that we will get a vaccine that's safe and effective as soon as possible, but I think it's very dangerous at this point to give specific dates because, while there are reasons to be hopeful, we do have, for example, multiple vaccine candidates that are in advanced stages of human trials and we do have collaborators who are working together around the world,” Murthy said.  
  The former surgeon general cautioned that there are two critical requirements for a successful vaccine. “One is that it is safe and the other is that it is effective and we cannot cut corners in getting there,” he said. “We can’t sacrifice our standards because if we do, it not only hurts people, but it’s going to damage people’s faith in vaccine efforts,” Murthy added.  Murthy said he’s bothered by polls showing nearly 50% of people said they had either decided against getting a Covid-19 vaccine or were uncertain about it. And that makes it all the more important that any vaccine that is approved or authorized has to be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration's external vaccine advisory committee and it has to be deliberated upon in a public forum, he said.   “That’s also why we have to be very clear with people about what the distribution plan is for this vaccine because it will take months to get this vaccine out, even under optimal circumstances, which is why the vaccination campaign we develop has got to be top-notch and executed well.”

Texas is currently reporting 8,302 hospitalizations, down 153 from the day before, and 7,598 new positive cases, which is down 1,108 from the day before and 1,202 from the week before.  The positivity rate continues to climb, as it's done all week, with the rate at 17.05% as of Aug. 5. (Texas testing data lags one day behind.) That's the second highest rate reported by Texas during the pandemic, with the peak being 17.43% in mid-July.  The positivity rate was just 12.09% one week ago.

  5:50 p.m. ET, August 6, 2020 Kentucky governor extends mask mandate for another 30 days From CNN’s James Froio Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear speaks during a press conference on August 6. Governor Andy Beshear 
  Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has extended the state's mask mandate for another 30 days.  "We're going to extend that facial covering mandate for another 30 days...it's working. And since we made it mandatory, more people are wearing them. We are ahead this week, we have fewer cases this week through Thursday," the governor said today. 
  Beshear reported 516 new Covid-19 cases, which he said is 247 less cases compared to Monday through Thursday of last week.  The governor attributed this decline in cases to the assumption that more people are wearing face coverings due to the statewide mandate. “If these numbers continue they are further evidence that wearing that facial covering, wearing that mask is truly helping Kentucky in so many different ways. Our people, our economy, our kids," he said. 
  Beshear said he believes that the mask mandate will pave the way for safer reopenings of businesses, and for schools as well.    “This is saving lives, saving our economy, and we hope it will get us in a position to get our kids back in school. It is a small thing to do for such an important reward," the governor added. By the numbers:  Kentucky now has a total of 33,254 Covid-19 cases.
