  More than 80 inmates have tested positive for cornavirus at an Indiana prison, according to NBC South Bend affiliate WNDU. 
  Indiana State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box discussed the growing outbreak at the Westville Correctional Facility in northwest Indiana, saying people in the prison who have tested positive are being isolated.
  A man  incarcerated in the Indiana prison died of the virus this week , renewing a push by civil liberties groups to release those incarcerated who are at-risk, a move  the governor opposes.
