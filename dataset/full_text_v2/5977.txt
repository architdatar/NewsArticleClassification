  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared a state of emergency on Saturday, stating the coronavirus pandemic required "extraordinary decisions."
  The government, he said, had agreed to a number of economic measures aimed to help workers and companies during the period. The state of emergency is to last for all of Spain for 15 days.
  Sanchez also confirmed that the country would be under partial lockdown, as the nation coped with the spread of the disease.
