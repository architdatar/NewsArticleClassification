  Princess Cruises announced Thursday it will voluntarily pause global operations of its 18 cruise ships for two months, affecting voyages departing March 12 to May 10, according to a news release.
  “Princess Cruises is a global vacation company that serves more than 50,000 guests daily from 70 countries as part of our diverse business, and it is widely known that we have been managing the implications of COVID-19 on two continents,” said Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises. 
  The company owns the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had passengers  quarantined for two weeks off the coast of Japan  in February, many of them becoming infected with coronavirus aboard the ship. 
  Viking Cruises also announced on Wednesday they plan to suspend their cruise operations until May 1. "I am sure you recognize that COVID-19 has made travel exceedingly complicated," Viking Chairman Torstein Hagen said.
