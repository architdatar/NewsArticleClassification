  A  new coronavirus patient from Santa Clara County, California , had not traveled to China, was not related to two other cases in the region and had not been to Solano County, about 70 miles away, where  the country's only other patient without a known source of infection  resides, health officials said Friday.
  “What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” said Dr. Sara Cody, director of Santa Clara County's public health department, in a news conference Friday.
  The two cases of possible "community spread" of the virus could mean that more people may have to stay home from work and school and follow essential hygiene practices, she said.
  Santa Clara County officials are working to reconstruct the woman's recent contacts and travels in an attempt to determine where she picked up the virus. 
  Dr. Charity Dean of the  California Department of Public Health announced the state has enabled eight public health labs capable of testing for the virus with faster results.
