  Testifying by videoconference before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said "of course" the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. is unacceptable.
  His comments came in response to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.,Â who also asked Fauci if he would say "the U.S. has to do better."
  "Of course, you always have to do better," Fauci said, but urged officials not to compare the U.S. with countries like South Korea.
