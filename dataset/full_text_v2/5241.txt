  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Anthony Fauci called her the night earlier to brief her on the  travel ban  that was announced by President Donald Trump in his Oval Office address.
  Pelosi said that Fauci said it was a "scientific medical decision."
  "It’s just strange because they’re saying it’s easy to travel among these countries but they’re separate from the U.K. Well you can just get on the Chunnel and you’ll be in the U.K.," she said.
