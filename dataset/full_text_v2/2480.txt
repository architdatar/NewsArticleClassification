  A person who attended the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C., has tested positive for  coronavirus , the event's organizer said Saturday.
  The American Conservative Union said in a statement the patient was exposed to the virus before attending the  four-day CPAC  in National Harbor, Maryland, last week.
  "The individual is under the care of medical professionals in the state of New Jersey and has been quarantined," the union said. "This attendee had no interaction with the President or the Vice President and never attended the events in the main hall."
  President Donald Trump spoke at the conference Feb. 29 and Vice President Mike Pence on Feb. 27.
