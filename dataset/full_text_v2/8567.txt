  The UK will open the doors this week on what could soon be the biggest intensive care unit in the country -- and it was built in about a week.  As the number of Covid-19 cases in the UK began to rise, the National Health Service (NHS) realized it might be short many thousands of ICU beds.  It hopes the solution is at a massive convention space in London’s East End.  The ExCel Center is more accustomed to showcasing the latest ventilator technology than actually using it.  The coronavirus field hospital will be called NHS Nightingale, after the pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale.  “Oh my goodness, there is no comparison,” says Natalie Forrest when asked about the hospital’s scale.  
  She is the operational guru responsible for transforming empty halls into a functioning hospital.  When fully running, it will have 4,000 beds. At the moment, just a few dozen that CNN saw were ready.  “Obviously we don’t want to use those beds,” Forrest says.  It’s staff, rather than equipment, that medical director Dr. Alan McGlennan says he’s most nervous about running out of.  “Critical care nurses are in very short supply,” he said.  It won’t be a hospital in a traditional sense. There will be no front door, no waiting rooms. “We will be receiving patients from ICUs across London,” Forrest says.  “So not all types of patients -- just patients who are sedated and ventilated, and need to be cared for in an ICU.” Britain has more than 25,400 coronavirus cases, with nearly 1,800 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

  Carnival Corporation is seeking at least $6 billion to weather an  unprecedented crisis  that has decimated business, after  coronavirus outbreaks  aboard its cruise ships killed several passengers and sickened hundreds more.  The cruise operator announced on Tuesday that it intends to raise $3 billion of secured notes and $1.75 billion of convertible notes -- both due in three years -- and $1.25 billion of new shares.  Carnival is suffering "a monthly cash burn of approximately $500 million" and the fresh injection of cash should keep the company afloat for the next 12 to 13 months, Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said on Tuesday. Carnival is the world's largest cruise operator:  It runs flagship line Carnival Cruise, Costa Cruises, the Holland America Line and the Princess Cruises brand, whose fleet includes the Diamond Princess --  a ship that became a floating quarantine zone  off the coast of Yokohama in February. More than 700 people contracted the virus onboard the ship, 10 of whom died. Read more on this  here.

  Hong Kong is currently seeing a second wave of infections from imported coronavirus cases, after an initial outbreak was mostly brought under control in the city. As of Tuesday afternoon, Hong Kong has reported 714 cases, up from 407 a week ago on March 25. To date, 50,000 mandatory quarantine orders have been issued for travelers returning to the city, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced during a regular news briefing on Tuesday. The city has also conducted 90,000 laboratory tests for the virus -- a rate of 12,000 tests per million people -- making it one of the highest test rates in the world, according to Dr. Wong Ka-hing, director of the Centre for Health Protection.  The government has identified at least 70 people who have breached their mandatory self-isolation orders, Lam said, forcing the government to adopt a "zero-tolerance" policy.  Offenders risk being sent to a mandatory government quarantine center. They could also face fines of up to 25,000 Hong Kong dollars ($3,225) and six months in prison.

  The coronavirus pandemic is the "greatest test" the world has faced since the United Nations was formed in the wake of World War II, said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.  "COVID-19 is the greatest test that we have faced together since the formation of the United Nations," Guterres said  in a new report released Tuesday.   "This human crisis demands coordinated, decisive, inclusive and innovative policy action from the world’s leading economies – and maximum financial and technical support for the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries. "But this is much more than a health crisis. It is a human crisis. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is attacking societies at their core."  
  Guterres said the world must work together if it is going to reduce the social and economic impact of the coronavirus on the global population. In response to the crisis, the secretary-general said in a statement that he has established a dedicated Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund to support the efforts of low- and middle-income countries to stop local epidemics. The United Nations was founded in 1945 in the immediate aftermath of World War II by more than 50 countries with an aim of increasing cooperation between states and preventing conflict. It now has  193 member states.
