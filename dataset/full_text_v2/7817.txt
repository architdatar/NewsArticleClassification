  Two health care workers in Northern California have tested positive for the coronavirus: one each in Alameda and Solano counties.
  Both individuals had exposure to a woman who tested positive Wednesday and is currently hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center. That woman was the first reported case of community spread in the U.S.
  The two health care workers are from NorthBay VacaValley Hospital. Both are in isolation at home. 
  The two cases are presumptive positives, meaning they are waiting on confirmatory testing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
