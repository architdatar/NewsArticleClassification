  Countries that have been under stringent lockdowns to stop the spread of the coronavirus have experienced an unintended benefit. The outbreak has, at least in part, contributed to a noticeable drop in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in some nations.
  Pollution-monitoring satellites operated by NASA and the European Space Agency observed drastic decreases in air pollution over China over a two-week period in February when parts of the country were under strict quarantine orders. Similar emissions drop-offs have been observed in recent weeks over Italy, where roughly 60 million people are under lockdown to contain the coronavirus’ rate of infection.
  Though grim, scientists said these trends could offer tough lessons for how to prepare — and ideally avoid — the most destructive impacts of climate change.
