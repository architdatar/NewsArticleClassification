  Utah Gov. Gary Herbert issued a  statewide stay-at-home order  Friday in effect for at least two weeks. 
  Residents should leave home only to perform essential duties such as visiting the grocery store or a doctor's office. He encouraged people to work from home.
  In a series of tweets, Herbert urged people to exercise outside but cautioned against congregating at trailheads or parks. He also instructed employers not to require sick notes for employees who call out from work as a result of coronavirus.
  We are in the throes of a very challenging time. All of us are making difficult adjustments, some big, and some small, to our daily lives. Today I'm issuing a "Stay Safe, Stay Home" directive to all Utahns.
