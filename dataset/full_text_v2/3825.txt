  Illinois reported a  new daily high in coronavirus cases  on Wednesday as experts project the state has yet to even hit its peak. 
  There were a total of 2,049 new cases in the last day, pushing the state's total number of positive tests above 35,000. Officials say the peak in Illinois is now projected to hit in mid-May, later than initially expected. 
  The state is under a stay-at-home order until April 30, but Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he may extend the order. 
  UPDATE: We are reporting 2,049 new cases from yesterday, including 98 individuals who have lost their lives.   Our statewide totals included 35,018 cases and 1,565 deaths.
