  Police in Sunnyvale, California, on Thursday reported the death of a 72-year-old person who officials later learned had been on a cruise ship with two passengers suspected of having the coronavirus illness COVID-19.
  It is unknown if the man actually had the coronavirus,Â Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety Chief Phan Ngo said.
  Officers were dispatched to the medical call Thursday morning, and as a precaution, all officers involved were quarantined for several hours and have returned home. They will not return to work until health officials say it is safe to do so, Ngo said. CPR was performed on the patient but it was not mouth-to-mouth.
  There has been one death in California, in Placer County, involving someone who tested positive for the illness, and that elderly person was likely exposed during international travel on a cruise ship that traveled from San Francisco to Mexico in mid-February, officials have said. Sunnyvale is in Santa Clara County, where there have  been 20 confirmed cases  so far.
