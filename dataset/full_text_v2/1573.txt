  Art lovers were locked out of Paris's famous Louvre on Sunday as staff at the world’s most-visited museum held a meeting about the coronavirus outbreak.
  Long lines of disgruntled tourists snaked outside the museum which is home to Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa portrait and the Venus de Milo sculpture.
  A spokeswoman said the museum in central Paris was expected to open after the meeting between management, personnel and the staff doctor.
  She added museums were not covered by government orders to cancel and until further notice, all public gatherings indoors or in confined spaces with more than 5,000 people.

  The government issued the orders on Saturday in a bid to contain the spread of the virus,  which has been confirmed in 100 cases in the country so far.
