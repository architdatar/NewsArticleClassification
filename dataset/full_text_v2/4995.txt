  Mayor Bill de Blasio, in touting the success of the shutdown of the New York City subway early Wednesday morning for overnight cleaning, said 139 homeless individuals out of 252 agreed to accept support and come off the streets.
  "This number is extraordinary," de Blasio said at a news conference. "More than half of the people encountered agreed to come in.Â We have never, ever seen so much success in a single night before."
  De Blasio said the city will "obviously need to see how things play out over a longer period of time."
