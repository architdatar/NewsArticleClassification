  The British government will announce travel agreements with countries, such as France, Greece and Spain, next week as it reviews its policy of imposing a 14-day quarantine for travelers arriving in Britain, the UK government said in a statement on Friday. “Countries have been classified as green, amber and red depending on their risk assessment, informed by factors including the prevalence of coronavirus within the country, our confidence in the reliability of their data, and crucially the trajectory of the disease in the country,” the statement read. “Low risk countries in the green and amber categories will be exempt from public health measures at the border.” A full list of the low risk countries will be published next week and travel to those destinations will be able to resume the following week. “Our new risk-assessment system will enable us to carefully open a number of safe travel routes around the world — giving people the opportunity for a summer holiday abroad and boosting the UK economy through tourism and business,” a government spokesperson said. “But we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if any risks re-emerge, and this system will enable us to take swift action to re-introduce self-isolation measures if new outbreaks occur overseas."

  6:55 p.m. ET, June 26, 2020 Vice President Pence and airline executives agree to move forward with contact tracing of passengers From CNN's Pete Muntean Vice President Mike Pence speaks at a news conference on Friday. Susan Walsh/AP 
  Vice President Mike Pence has told major airlines to move forward with an industry-led solution for the contact tracing of passengers.  A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Pence gave his blessing to a “compromise solution” for contact tracing during a Friday meeting with airline executives. Airlines initially balked at the government's demand that they collect detailed contact information on all passengers and distribute it to public health officials if requested.  The airlines said it would be impossible to quickly overhaul the massive legacy computer systems that handle the industry's vast booking networks The source told CNN that Pence now supports the airlines' proposal for a third-party app and website that would require passengers to input five points of data. The industry group, Airlines for America, said in a statement after the meeting that it looked forward to implement some initiatives to help relaunch the airline industry. “We appreciate the collaboration and interest of the Administration since the onset of the pandemic. We had a constructive conversation today with the Vice President and remain grateful for his leadership through this health crisis. We look forward to working with the Administration to identify and implement initiatives that help relaunch the U.S. airline industry, get people moving again and rebuild the American economy," the statement said. 
  The 45-minute, closed-door meeting also covered temperature checks and expected European Union restrictions on Americans traveling abroad, but the source underscores the most substantive talks centered on contact tracing.

  Palm Beach County Mayor Dave Kerner announced at a news conference that the county board approved a mask mandate by a unanimous vote of 7-0.  The mandate went into effect Thursday night. It requires that masks be worn by “all persons when obtaining any service from any establishment and by all persons working in those establishments.”  These rules apply “to all businesses including but not limited to restaurants, retail establishments, hotels, grocery stores, gyms, pharmacies, recreational facilities and vehicles for hire” such as Uber, the mandate added. People who are excluded from the wearing a mask include “individuals while actively engaged in exercising while maintaining social distancing in accordance to (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) guidelines” as well as children under the age of two and children of any age “while in the custody of a licensed child care facility." The exclusion also applies to people with medical conditions like asthma. People for “whom wearing a facial covering conflicts with their religious beliefs or practices” are also exempt from wearing a mask, the mandate said. More details:  With reported cases on the rise, Kerner pointed out that the “vast majority of spread is occurring” within the 25-34 age group. To help ensure that all residents of Palm Beach County have facial coverings, Kerner said that “1.5 million reusable masks have been purchased by the county and will be distributed by direct mail to all 660,000 homes."

  6:36 p.m. ET, June 26, 2020 San Francisco delays reopening as coronavirus cases rise From CNN's Cheri Mossburg and Alexandra Meeks A man wears a face mask while cleaning an outdoor dining table at The Hook at San Francisco's Pier 39 on June 18. Jeff Chiu/AP 
  San Francisco is delaying its reopening as coronavirus cases rise, according to Mayor London Breed. Noting that San Francisco has seen a rise in cases, from 20 on June 15 to 103 on Thursday, Breed said in a series of tweets that at the current rate cases could double rapidly.  “If that continues and we don’t intervene, we’ll be at such a high number that our only option would be to shut down,” Breed said. 
  San Francisco had planned to continue reopening the city on Monday. The mayor urged residents to wear face coverings, maintain social distance, and practice good hygiene. Breed also encouraged essential workers and those with symptoms to get tested. “I know people are anxious to reopen, I am too. But we can't jeopardize the progress we've made,” Breed said. “Let’s protect each other so that we can safely reopen San Francisco.” Despite San Francisco's stay-at-home orders and various programs to flatten the curve of Covid-19 cases, the curve in the city is getting "quite steep," Public Health Director Dr. Grant Colfax said at a news conference Friday. "We've talked about flattening that curve but that curve is not flat right now," Colfax said. "In fact, that curve is getting more and more vertical." In the last couple of weeks, San Francisco has seen a near doubling in the rate of diagnosed infections, Colfax said.  There have been no indications that the rise in cases are tied to a specific facility or event, but health officials say the data within the next few days in particular will be critical to see whether the pattern is sustained.  "We're taking a pause here, we're not reversing, and I think we're just going to have to watch the data," Colfax said.

  6:28 p.m. ET, June 26, 2020 FDA sends warning letter to company over Covid-19 skin spray claims From CNN's Jen Christensen The US Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to Curativa Bay Corporation over its claims one of its products could protect against the novel coronavirus. The FDA said Friday the Clearwater, Florida, based company advertised its Advanced Hypochlorous Skin Spray on its Facebook page as something that could “provide a good extra line of protection against many things that we all fear today… #Kill bacteria and viruses… #Coronavirus.” The spray is a topical hypochlorous acid, an inorganic substance that can kill bacteria, but to sell a product in the US as a prevention or treatment for disease requires scientific evidence and well-controlled human clinical studies. The FDA says there is no such support.  The FDA said the company needs to take corrective actions immediately to ensure that it is not misleadingly representing its products as safe and effective for a Covid-19 related use, or it will face legal action. The FDA also said it was going to include the company on its list of firms that have received these warning letters for selling Covid-19-related products that are in violation of regulations. If the company takes corrective action, the FDA said it will remove it from its list.

  6:33 p.m. ET, June 26, 2020 Travelers from the US "unlikely" to be allowed to travel to the European Union From CNN’s Vasco Cotovio and James Frater in London  Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images 
  Travelers from the United States are “unlikely” to be allowed into the European Union as ambassadors of the 27 members states have agreed "in principle"   to the criteria they will apply as the bloc begins to opens up, several EU officials told CNN on Friday The agreement is not final as the ambassadors will still need to consult with their respective governments.  Under the current criteria — which takes into account the number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the past 14 days — the US would likely be excluded. An EU diplomat told CNN that it was very “unlikely” travelers from the US would be allowed in, adding that even though the list had not been finalized “the US’s chances are close to zero.” The diplomat also said, “with their infection rates... not even they can believe in that possibility.”  Asked if the US was on a draft list of countries whose citizens would not be allowed to travel to the EU starting Wednesday, another EU diplomat would not confirm that list existed but said, “if you run the numbers you can create a list.”  The first point on the checklist asks whether the country can "be considered as being in a comparable or better epidemiological situation as the average in the EU+ area" with regard to number of new infections, trend of new infections and response in areas such as testing, surveillance, contact tracing, containment, treatment and reporting.

  5:42 p.m. ET, June 26, 2020 California governor says coronavirus-related death rates around the state "are lagging" From CNN's Cheri Mossburg  Pool/KCRA 
  Gov. Gavin Newsom said coronavirus death rates in California "are lagging" and thus, do not accurately reflect the toll of the virus. He warned that with the case count increasing, a rise in hospitalizations and death rates will soon follow. The governor implored people to wear masks and stay six feet apart. "Please, please, practice common sense. Practice common decency. Please take this pandemic seriously," Newsom said. “Protect yourself, but also, protect others.”  
  Newsom said the country is in "the midst of the first wave of this pandemic." “We are not out of the first wave. This disease does not take a summer vacation," the governor added.
