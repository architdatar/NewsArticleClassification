  What you need to know It's Labor Day in the US, and  events are in full swing — and many  include the large crowds health experts feared.  States should be prepared to distribute a  coronavirus  vaccine by Nov. 1 "just in case" one is ready, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said. India has surpassed Brazil as the country with the second-highest number of confirmed infections after it reported 90,802 cases today — its highest daily spike.

  3:08 p.m. ET, September 7, 2020 Trump tries and fails to get reporter to remove mask at news conference From CNN's Ali Main Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asks the President a question during Monday's news conference. Sarah Silbiger/Reuters 
  In his Monday afternoon news conference, President Trump got into an exchange with Reuters correspondent Jeff Mason after Mason would not remove his face mask at the request of the President. The President stopped Mason as he began to ask the first question, saying "you're going to have to take that off, please." He gestured to the space between the reporter and the podium, inquiring, "you're...how many feet are you away?" Mason replied that he would just speak louder to counter the effects of the mask.  Trump was not satisfied with this response, telling the reporter his voice was "very muffled" with the face covering, "so if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier." Mason raised his voice and repeated his offer to speak louder, asking "is that better?" The President sighed saying, "it's better. Yeah, it's better." Later in the news conference, Trump remarked that one reporter who did remove his mask sounded "so clear. As opposed to everybody else, where they refuse." This is not the first time that the President has requested a reporter take off his or her mask so that he could hear a question more clearly, but his disappointment with Mason's response was notable.

  2:23 p.m. ET, September 7, 2020 Trump: We could have a vaccine "before a very special date" President Trump said there could be a coronavirus vaccine "before a very special date." While Trump did not specially mention which date, he has previously suggested that a vaccine for coronavirus  could be ready before Election Day. "President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time. By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn't have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn't have it at all," Trump said today at a news conference. "So, we're going to have a vaccine very soon. Maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I'm talking about," he added. 
  Facts First:   It's possible that a vaccine could be approved by the Food and Drug Administration at some point in November, but there is obviously no firm timeline or guarantee that one will be. And even when one is approved, it will likely still be many months before it's widely available across the US.  You can  read CNN's full fact check on Trump's previous suggestion that there could be a vaccine ready before Election Day here. Watch here:

  3:46 p.m. ET, September 7, 2020 Trump: Democrats don't want a stimulus deal because it'll help me in the election President Donald Trump speaks from the North Portico of the White House on Monday. Patrick Semansky/AP 
  President Trump said congressional Democrats don't want to make a stimulus deal because such a deal would be beneficial to him in the November election.   "They think it's good for politics if they don't make a deal," Trump said at an ongoing Labor Day news conference "They don't want to make a deal because they know that's good for the economy. And if they make deal that's good for the economy — and therefore, it's good for me for the election in November, Nov. 3 — and therefore, they're not going to make a deal," he added. About the stimulus stall:  Lawmakers  don't appear any closer  to striking a deal on additional coronavirus stimulus. Democrats are pushing for a wide-ranging, multi-trillion dollar proposal with funding for schools, rental assistance, health providers and small businesses.  Senate GOP leadership, meanwhile,  has been working for weeks  behind the scenes toward building internal consensus on a scaled-back, or "skinny" proposal that would include funds for education, small business, a scaled-back enhanced federal unemployment benefit and liability protections.

  1:41 p.m. ET, September 7, 2020 Florida reports lowest number of new coronavirus cases in nearly 3 months From CNN's Artemis Moshtaghian Florida health officials reported 1,838 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, the lowest daily tally of cases in nearly three months.  The last time the state reported a low caseload was on June 15 when it recorded 1,758 coronavirus cases, according to numbers released by the Florida Department of Health. In spite of the holiday weekend, today’s new count reflects a downward trend of new coronavirus cases and does not deviate that much from the number of new cases reported on previous Mondays. Last Monday, on Aug. 31, Florida reported 1,885 new cases. The total number of positive coronavirus cases across the state is at least 648,269, and today’s death toll of 22 fatalities brings the state total to 11,871 among Florida residents.

  Despite the rising numbers of coronavirus cases in France, the French Tennis Federation announced Monday the 2020 French Open will be open to fans when play begins later this month. The Grand Slam event was originally scheduled for May but was postponed by the pandemic. Tournament officials say Roland-Garros, where the tournament is played, will be divided into three zones, with a maximum of 5,000 fans in each of two zones and a maximum of 1,500 in the third. Seats in the stands will be allocated under strict tournament protocols, with a maximum of four spectators sitting in adjacent seats indoors. Spectators over the age of 11 will be required to wear face coverings. Qualifying rounds will be played behind closed doors between Sept. 21 and 25. According to tournament director Guy Forget, all players will be tested upon arrival in Paris. They will be approved to play if they test negative when arriving and again 72 hours later. Players will also be tested every five days as long as they remain in contention and must stay in one of two hotels arranged by tournament organizers. What the numbers look like:  French officials have confirmed more than 367,000 cases and more than 30,000 deaths from Covid-19, the seventh-highest number of fatalities caused by coronavirus worldwide according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.

Employers added 1.4 million   jobs in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. Job growth at that level marks a slowdown from earlier this summer: Employers added a revised  1.7 million jobs in July  and  4.8 million jobs in June .

  12:22 p.m. ET, September 7, 2020 World needs to "celebrate the successes where we can" for Covid-19, WHO says From CNN's Amanda Watts The world needs to “celebrate the successes where we can” when it comes to Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, a World Health Organization infectious disease epidemiologist, said during a Friday news briefing. “We're not out of the woods. We do have a long way to go. The virus has plenty of room to move, but we have tools in place that really work," Van Kerkhove said. 
  “We need to highlight and support each other in sharing the stories of what has worked,” Van Kerhove added. She added that while many people may be "tired" of the pandemic, "we will get throught this." “I think many people — individuals, governments — everyone is tired. And seeing resurgence in many places can be very difficult to handle — mentally, physically — but we will get through this," she said.
