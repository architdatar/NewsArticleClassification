  New York state added at least another 337 victims to its COVID-19 death toll, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday. 
  The grim total has now reached 17,303 deaths, not including those who are presumptive COVID-19 victims. 
  It was, however, the second consecutive day that New York's daily tally came in at under 400 fatalities.
