  The Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday said it's already paid out $207 billion in  coronavirus stimulus checks . 
  "The IRS and Treasury have executed an extraordinary task by delivering more than 130 million Economic Impact Payments, totaling more than $207 billion, to Americans in less than 30 days," the agency said in a statement.
  The total number of payouts since Friday is surprising because the IRS and Treasury Department said then they had sent out  88 million payments  totaling about $158 billion since checks started going out April 11. About 150 million Americans are eligible for the checks. 
  The one-time payments were included as part of the  $2 trillion  coronavirus package Congress passed in March.
