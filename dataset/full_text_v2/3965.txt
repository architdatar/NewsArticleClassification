  The Israeli government is imposing a complete nationwide lockdown prohibiting people from leaving their homes from Wednesday evening until Thursday morning,  Prime Minister Netanyahu announced in a televised address  to the nation on Monday. 
  The lockdown coincides with the Jewish Passover holiday in which families typically gather together for a traditional dinner called the seder. 
  "We cannot become complacent. We are moving forward with preparations for the scenarios regarding the exit from the crisis," Netanyahu said, adding that "there is a real possibility that if the positive trends" continue, Israel could gradually exit the lockdown after Passover.
