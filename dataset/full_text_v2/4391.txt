  Marriott International Inc., which employs more than 175,000 people worldwide, has started to furlough what it expects will be tens of thousands of those workers as its properties close.
  The furloughs, first reported by  The Wall Street Journal , were confirmed to NBC News by Marriott, which is the world's largest hotel company. The employees won't be paid but will keep their health benefits.
  Marriott started closing some of its managed properties across its 30 brands last week and is also furloughing staff at still-open hotels.  In a statement Tuesday , the company said customers could cancel their stays at no charge through April 30. 
  "As travel restrictions and social distancing efforts around the world become more widespread, we are experiencing significant drops in demand at properties globally with an uncertain duration," the chain said in a statement. "We are adjusting global operations accordingly which has meant either reduction in hours or a temporary leave for many of our associates at our properties."
