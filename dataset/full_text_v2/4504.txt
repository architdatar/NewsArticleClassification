  Starting Wednesday, the city of Miami will allow dine-in eating to resume at restaurants, but with  restrictions  aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.
  "Restaurants are a big part of our local economy, directly employing thousands of Miamians, and we are ready to begin carefully reopening them to dine-in customers,” Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said in a statement.
  Restaurant capacity will be capped at 50 percent of maximum approved occupancy. Masks will be required unless customers are seated at a table, and no parties larger than four allowed, except household parties, which are capped at six. Restaurant bars remain closed for now.
  The city of Miami Beach also  announced Tuesday  that restaurants could reopen Wednesday.
