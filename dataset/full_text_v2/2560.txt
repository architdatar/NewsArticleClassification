  Cybercriminals, often linked with other state actors, are seeking to exploit COVID-19 with tactics such as fraud and espionage, the U.K.  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab  said Tuesday. 
  Teams from the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre and the U.S.  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  have identified campaigns targeting health care bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organizations and various different arms of local government, he said. 
  “There are various objectives and motivations that lie behind these attacks from fraud on the one hand to espionage, but they tend to be designed to steal bulk personal data, intellectual property and wider information that supports those aims, and they’re often linked with other state actors,” Raab said during Britain’s daily coronavirus briefing on Tuesday.  
  Raab warned that he expected this “predatory criminal behavior” to continue to evolve over the weeks and months ahead and added that the government would share advice to help citizens and businesses defend themselves against  cyberattacks  from “hostile states” to “criminal gangs.”
