  The IRS  launched a website  on Wednesday to help people expedite the delivery of stimulus money by providing banking details. The website also helps people track the status of their payment. 
  People will need to enter their Social Security Number, date of birth and mailing address to track payments. To speed payment, taxpayers will need to enter their adjusted gross income from either 2019 or 2018, the refund or amount owed from their most recent taxes, and their banking information.
  The website debuted the same day that many people reported that stimulus payments had hit their bank accounts. Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin  first announced  the website last week.
