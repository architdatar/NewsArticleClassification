  The Massachusetts Department of Public Health  said Monday  that the state has its first presumptive case of the illness caused by the coronavirus, COVID-19, since local testing began Friday.
  The patient in the presumptive positive case announced Monday was described as a woman in her 20s who recently traveled to Italy with a school group and is now recovering at home.
  She had symptoms and a local test came back positive Monday evening, the state health department said. A CDC test will be done to confirm the local test.
  "We are grateful this individual is recovering," Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel said in a statement. "We understand the concern this new virus is causing, and our state’s ability to quickly test for the virus is a positive development. The risk to the public from COVID-19 remains low in Massachusetts."
  Previously  another person , a Boston man who returned from Wuhan, China, was confirmed to have it by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testing.
  The person who had previously been confirmed by CDC testing to have COVID-19 was a student at the University of Massachusetts Boston who returned from Wuhan, China, in early February, and he is recovering well,  NBC Boston reported  citing officials.
  Six people have died  in the state of Washington.
