  Georgia has reported its first cases of novel coronavirus, officials said Monday.
  Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters that the cases, which were confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, involved two people in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta.
  The people live in the same home and one had recently traveled to Milan, Italy, he said. The country has  seen more cases of the virus  than any other in Europe, with more than 1,800 cases and 52 deaths.
  The person developed symptoms shortly after returning to Georgia, Kemp said.
  The pair is at home with other relatives who were showing minor symptoms of the virus, said Kathleen Toomey, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health.
  Toomey said that epidemiologists were working to trace their contacts to prevent the virus from further spreading.
  Citing privacy concerns, officials declined to provide additional details about the cases.
