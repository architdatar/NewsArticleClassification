  In testimony before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee meeting Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that there was a new coronavirus case confirmed in the U.S.
  "Coming into this hearing, I was informed that we have a 15th confirmed case, the epidemiology of which we are still discerning," Azar said.
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention breaks down U.S. cases into two main categories: Travel-related, which includes person-to-person spread, and repatriated individuals.
  A total of 45 repatriated individuals, who were evacuated from either Wuhan, China or the Diamond Princess cruise ship, have tested positive. 
  There were fourteen cases among individuals who traveled back to the U.S. on their own or individuals who were infected through close contact with one of these travelers. It is unclear how the new case mentioned by Azar was infected. 
  NBC News has reached out to the CDC for more information.
