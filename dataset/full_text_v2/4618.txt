  At least 710 crew members from the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for Covid-19 as of Tuesday, according to the US Navy. Nine sailors have been hospitalized for coronavirus. The Navy said 94% of the crew has been tested. At least 3,872 crew members tested negative for the disease.  Some background : The US Navy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have  launched an investigation  into the coronavirus outbreak aboard the  USS Theodore Roosevelt  aircraft carrier. The inquiry will look to establish the origin of the outbreak and understand how it spread rapidly on board the ship. To carry out the investigation, crew members are being asked on a voluntary basis to complete a survey and provide two new specimens — blood and nasal swabs — for laboratory testing, according to the Navy. It hopes to get 1,000 volunteers which is what it believes is needed for representative sampling.

  Since March 1, when coronavirus was first detected in Florida, hotel revenues are down by $1.6 billion dollars, compared to the same time last year. The data comes from a new resource page on the Visit Florida website that breaks down the impacts of the virus on the state’s tourism industry. The launching of the page was announced during Gov. Ron DeSantis’ task force meeting to reopen the state.  Airlines are also down:  Florida’s domestic airline capacity is down 65.8% for the period of April 20 to May 19, as compared to the same period in 2019, the website said. International airline capacity during the same period is down 78.4% as compared to the previous year. According to Visit Florida's new data, there has been a spike in visits to the “Current Travel Safety Information” page. The spike, according to Visit Florida,   is an indicator people are actively seeking information on how to safely travel to the state. Visit Florida is not a government agency, but a not-for-profit corporation made up of public and private partnership, according to the group’s website.

  2:25 p.m. ET, April 21, 2020 New study finds higher death rate in patients taking hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 From CNN Health’s Elizabeth Cohen and Minali Nigam A pharmacist shows a bottle of the drug hydroxychloroquine on Monday, April 6, in Oakland, California. Ben Margot/AP 
  Coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine, a treatment  touted by President Trump , were no less likely to need mechanical ventilation and had higher deaths rates compared to those who did not take the drug, according to a study of hundreds of patients at United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers. In the study of 368 patients, 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate.   “An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs,” wrote the authors, who work at the Columbia VA Health Care System in South Carolina, the University of South Carolina and the University of Virginia.   
  Researchers also looked at whether taking hydroxychloroquine or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, had an effect on whether a patient needed to go on a ventilator.  They found there was no difference between these groups and the patients who took neither drug.    “In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19,” the authors wrote.   Remember:  The study, which reviewed the veterans’ medical charts, was posted Tuesday on medrxiv.org, a pre-print server –– meaning it was not peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.  The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia.

  2:05 p.m. ET, April 21, 2020 New emergency business relief funds only projected to last a few days From CNN’s Julia Chatterley, Manu Raju and Clare Foran The $310 billion in new funding for the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program is only projected to last few days as businesses rush in for funds, according to a banking industry source. “Two-10 days, but our guess is on the lower end of that timeline,” the source said. Today, congressional negotiations reached a deal on a bill that includes hundreds of billions of dollars  in new funding  for small businesses hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, three sources familiar tell CNN. The text of the bill should be unveiled as soon as Tuesday afternoon as the two sides give the deal a final read.  Lawmakers will try to pass the bill in the Senate at 4 p.m. ET when the chamber convenes for a pro forma session.

  Republican leaders are pushing back on an effort to change the House rules to allow for remote voting by proxy ahead of an expected vote on the matter Thursday. "What are the details of this proposal, how will it avoid potential abuses of power, and when do you expect this proposal to be made public for the necessary scrutiny and member input that changing 200 years of House precedent would merit?” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this afternoon. 
  In the letter, he also raised questions about the 2020 House calendar and how committee business will be conducted going forward.  His comments come as Republican members are increasingly opposed to implementing proxy voting, which would allow members who are unable or unwilling to travel during the coronavirus pandemic to instruct another member how to vote on their behalf. House Democratic leaders have said they want to pass the rules change on a bipartisan basis, but as they are in the majority they could pass it without Republican support .  The language of the rules change has not been finalized yet, but it would be temporary and used only for emergencies like the pandemic, according to House Rules Chair Jim McGovern.

  Wisconsin's Department of Health Services said that they now have at least seven cases of Covid-19 tied to the  state's in-person election  on April 7, a spokesperson confirmed to CNN. "We are confirming 7 cases as of yesterday," the department's spokesperson Shawn Benjamin said in a statement. In an effort to investigate the impact of the election on the state's coronavirus cases, the department added “election activity” to its list of investigation questions in the disease registry, the statement said. "Please note that we only have 30% of the data back from new cases as of 4/7 and on," Benjamin said.  "We hope to have these fields complete by Friday and will provide a more complete report then," he added. "While we continue to monitor cases of Covid-19 linked to election activity, we know that gatherings such as [the election] are detrimental to the efforts to slow the spread of this pandemic," Dr. Ben Weston, the medical director for the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management, said in the statement.

  Mike Lanotte, the executive director for the New York State Funeral Directors Association, tells CNN that while the number of coronavirus-related deaths is decreasing, there is still a backlog of deaths in the system. Lanotte said his directors are still working through the same volume issues as earlier. The association is hopeful they will get relief as it relates to crematories which in New York City are four weeks behind on scheduling, according to Lanotte. Lanotte said they are working to expedite the process to make it easier for families. “Once the volume of death is handled, it will relieve some of the stress on the system but funeral directors lag behind the curve naturally,” Lanotte said.   
  Lanotte said New York state funeral directors are still working up to 16 hour days in order to answer all the requests for families and not turn anybody away. “We are looking to decompress the stress on downstate crematories by making the process as efficient as possible,” Lanotte said.
