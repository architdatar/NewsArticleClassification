  The Cannes Film Festival, set to be held in May, has been postponed amid the rampant spread of the coronavirus.Â 
  "Several options are considered in order to preserve its running, the main one being a simple postponement, in Cannes, until the end of June-beginning of July, 2020," organizers said on Thursday in a press release.Â 
  TheÂ team will be working with the French government and Cannes city hall to find alternative solutions to host the internationally acclaimed festival.Â 
  "In the meantime, the Festival de Cannes lends its vocal support to all of those who firmly call on everyone to respect the general lockdown, and ask to show solidarity in these difficult times for the entire world."Â 
  Due to the health crisis and the development of the French and international situation, the Festival de Cannes will no longer be able to take place on the dates planned, from May 12 to 23. More info  #Cannes2020  ðŸ‘‰  https://t.co/peLmfw0gQW   pic.twitter.com/SVWPasvU23
