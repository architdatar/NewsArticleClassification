  France’s parliament voted in favor Tuesday of the government’s plan to loosen the country’s lockdown restrictions next month. 
  French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said that as of May 11 all stores and shops will be able to open excluding cafes and restaurants. Some students within elementary schools will be able to return as of May 11, with older students and high schools slated to return later. 
  However, businesses have been encouraged to continue remote working for at least three more weeks. 
  Philippe also warned that if by May 7 the number of daily coronavirus cases recorded surpassed 3,000, then the loosening of restrictions in France would be postponed.
