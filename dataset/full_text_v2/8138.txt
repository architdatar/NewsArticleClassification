  The private equity firm buying up lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret has stepped away from the billion-dollar deal, citing store closures and other decisions the retailer made during the coronavirus pandemic. 
  Sycamore Partners said Wednesday it is backing out of an agreement made in February to acquire a 55 percent stake in Victoria’s Secret, in a deal  that valued the company at $1.1 billion. 
  L Brands, owner of the racy lingerie retailer, said in a statement it is headed to court to continue the transaction. It believes the termination is invalid.
  Shares declined more than 20 percent Wednesday, temporarily halting trading. L Brands and a representative for Sycamore Partners were not reachable for further comment.
