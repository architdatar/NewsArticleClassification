  Fox News contributor Karl Rove said on Friday that President Trump’s response to the  economic  fallout due to the  coronavirus  is going to have a “huge impact" on the election.
  “Presidents who are in recessions tend to lose, presidents who are not in recessions tend to win, but we have never been in a circumstance like this where the country has suffered economic contraction because of a virus this close to a presidential election,” the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush told “ Fox & Friends .”
  Rove said that although Americans may not hold Trump accountable for the coronavirus, they are going to judge him on his response to the pandemic and the impact on the economy in the months ahead.
  “Their question is going to be: 'Does he seem to be doing the things that are reasonable and prudent to get us back to economic health as rapidly as possible?'” Rove said.

  Rove said that Trump has faced two main challenges: the coronavirus itself as a health crisis and the aftermath of an economic contraction.
  “[American voters] are going to say, ‘How does he seem to be handling this? and, 'Does he seem to be moving us in the right direction?'” Rove said.
