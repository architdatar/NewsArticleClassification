  On Tuesday, Ryanair announced its plan for keeping passengers safe while flying during the coronavirus pandemic.
  The European budget airline said it plans to resume 40% of its scheduled flights beginning July 1, but with enhanced safety measures. The new guidelines include mandatory face coverings and temperature checks upon entering airports, rules already  implemented by other airlines . 
  Most notably, Ryanair is restricting access to bathrooms, saying passengers will need to ask permission to use the lavatory. The airline said the rule is being put in place to discourage passengers from lining up in the aisles of the aircraft. 
  “Queuing for toilets will also be prohibited on board although toilet access will be made available to individual passengers upon request,” the airline said in a  press release .
