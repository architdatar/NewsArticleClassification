  Moscow imposed a citywide quarantine starting March 30 until further notice for all residents regardless of their age, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said in a statement.  “(Since restrictions were imposed) movements in the city decreased by two-thirds, which this is very good,” Sobyanin said. "Although it is obvious that not everyone heard us." Residents will only be able to leave their houses to get urgent medical help, go to a nearby grocery store or pharmacy, and to walk their pets in the proximity of 100m from their residence. The exception will be made for essential workers. City officials will deploy a "smart monitoring" system to enforce these restrictions, Sobyanin said, and the city will develop a special pass system for people to get permission to leave their homes. Public and private transportation, as well as leaving or entering the city, is still allowed, according to the statement.

  3:44 p.m. ET, March 29, 2020 Ohio governor says state does not have enough N95 masks From CNN's Hollie Silverman Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine speaks in February. Tony Dejak/AP 
  Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his state does not have enough N95 masks to meet the demand of health care workers and first responders. Many people who need the masks are using them longer than they would normally use them, DeWine said. DeWine said he is hoping the Food and Drug Administration will give a full approval for the use of a mask-cleaning machine produced by Battelle. The governor said he called President Donald Trump Sunday morning to express how urgently the approval is needed and said the President told him he would do all he could to get the approval. Trump took to Twitter to express "hope" that the "FDA can approve Mask Sterilization equipment ASAP."  
  
  "As per Governor @MikeDeWine, there is a company in Ohio, @Batelle, which has equipment that can sterilize masks quickly," the President's tweet continued.  Battelle's machine is capable of sanitizing 80,000 N95 masks a day for reuse, DeWine said.

  2:25 p.m. ET, March 29, 2020 Canadian officials correct virus data, now say only 12% of patients hospitalized are under age 40 From CNN’s Paula Newton Canadian health officials Sunday corrected erroneous data reported widely during a press conference Saturday. In a tweet, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam apologized for the error and said: “I misspoke on the percentage of hospitalized cases.” “There was an error made. Based on a subset of case reports with age and hospitalization data, 12% (not 30%) of those hospitalized were under 40 years of age,” Health Canada wrote in an email sent to CNN. The statement attributed the error to a lag in ‘real time data’. “The case report forms lag behind the real time data, while they provide more in depth information for epidemiological analysis,” the statement said.

  1:39 p.m. ET, March 29, 2020 Travelers entering Florida should expect to be stopped and screened From CNN's Melissa Alonso Vehicle checkpoint on eastbound I-10 near the Florida-Alabama state line. Florida Highway Patrol 
  Motorists entering Florida will be directed to weigh stations by law enforcement officers who will allow travelers to either return to the interstate or to pull aside for further screening, according to a release from Florida Department of Transportation. The measure is part of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's order to limit community spread by requiring travelers on I-10 and I-95 coming from Louisiana, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to isolate for a period of 14 days. Travelers entering Florida will be required to complete a form, including each traveler’s contact information and trip details, the release said.  "Failure to complete the form and failure to follow any isolation or quarantine order from DOH are a violation of Florida law," according to the release. Florida Highway Patrol "will staff the checkpoint at I-10 at the Alabama/Florida line, 24 hours a day with approximately 16 troopers in 12-hour shifts," FDOT said. Travelers will be provided with a traveler card, "which has contact information and guidance in the event the traveler exhibits symptoms while in isolation that are attributed to" coronavirus, the release said.
