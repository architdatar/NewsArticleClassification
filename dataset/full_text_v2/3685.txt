  Christi A. Grimm, the principal deputy inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services, will testify before the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, a staffer on the committee told NBC News.
  She is expected to brief the panel on her office’s work on coronavirus and other aspects of the administration's response to the pandemic.
  In early April, Grimm presented President Donald Trump  with a report showing  that hospitals responding to the pandemic were lacking vital medical equipment including thermometers and test kits.
  Trump criticized Grimm in a  tweet  and then eventually nominated a new IG to replace her. Grimm was not fired and remains in a senior role at the IGs office.
  The committee notes this will take the form of a briefing and not a hearing. It will also take place entirely remote over video conference.
