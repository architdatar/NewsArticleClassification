  The anniversary comes as the U.K. government faces criticism from health workers over a  lack of sufficient protective gear , as well as complaints surrounding low levels of virus testing. The U.K. has reported more than 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Friday, and new  data suggests  the country has the highest death toll in Europe, with more than 30,000 dead.
