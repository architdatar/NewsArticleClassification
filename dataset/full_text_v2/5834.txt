  A U.S. senator said Tuesday that tech executives should face personal legal consequences if they don't protect the privacy of people using their smartphones to track the coronavirus. 
  Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote in a  letter  to Google and Apple about  their virus-tracing plans  that their executives should be "personally liable if you stop protecting privacy." He said the companies should not, for example, give advertising companies access once the pandemic is over. 
  "Do not hide behind a corporate shield like so many privacy offenders have before. Stake your personal finances on the security of this project," he wrote. 
  Apple and Google have said their plans would be voluntary and include  a number of privacy measures . Apple and Google declined to comment on Hawley's letter.
