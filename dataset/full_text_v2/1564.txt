  New York City now has 110 cases of  children with a rare inflammatory syndrome thought to be linked to the coronavirus , a 10 percent rise in one day, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday.
  The newly-identified condition, tentatively called  pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome , has symptoms mirroring toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease, including severe inflammation of the coronary arteries. The CDC is calling the illness "MIS-C."
  The city reported 100 cases on Thursday.
  De Blasio said Friday that all five boroughs have cases, but the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens have the most.
  He said African American children account for at least 24 percent of the known cases, while in 38 percent of the cases the race is unknown.
