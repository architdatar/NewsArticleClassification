  Burning Man, the end-of-summer music and arts festival in the Nevada desert, has been canceled for 2020 as a result of COVID-19, organizers said Friday.
  The weeklong event on federal land in the Silver State's Black Rock desert is one of several high-profile music gatherings, including  Miami's Ultra Festival; SXSW  in Austin, Texas;  Coachella  in Indio, California; and Las Vegas' Electric Daisy Carnival, to cancel or postpone in reaction to the continued spread of coronavirus.
  Marian Goodell, Burning Man project CEO,  announced  that a virtual version of the festival, which started in the 1980s in San Francisco, will take place in the stead of the  colorful antics  on the festival's famous Black Rock "playa."
  She offered refunds for the nearly $500 tickets "to those that need" them, but otherwise asked so-called burners to convert their purchases into  tax-deductible donations  as the nonprofit organization would likely face layoffs.
