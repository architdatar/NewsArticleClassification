  April retail sales sank by 16.4 percent to their lowest level on record, as stores and restaurants felt the full weight of a month of coronavirus closures.
  The monthly sales data, which measures spending at places such as gas stations, restaurants, bars, and stores, was released Friday by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.
  The number was worse than economists had been anticipating, with most having forecast a 12 percent drop.
  By comparison, March sales were down by 8.3 percent, which was at that time the worst decline since records began in 1992.
  Consumer spending drives around three-quarters of the U.S. economy, but social distancing measures have restricted business operations, limited driving, and forced the closure of most retail stores and food service locations.
