  The watchdog for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department has issued a fraud alert for coronavirus scams such as fraudulent testing kits and treatment across the country.
  A spokesperson for the HHS inspector general says telemarketers have been calling people offering fake coronavirus tests while other scammers have been looking to hire phony technicians to swab multiple people, charge them for tests, but never provide results.  The inspector general's agents have also noticed an uptick in “door to door visits and social media ads about unapproved treatments.”
  Other scams have offered fake telemedicine as part of an identity theft scheme, the inspector general warned.  The office has also found fake charities applying for grants to help people in the community who are needy.
