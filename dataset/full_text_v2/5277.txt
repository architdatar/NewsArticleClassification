  5:37 p.m. ET, June 26, 2020 Pence claims Americans are seeing "encouraging news" as cases surge From CNN's Jason Hoffman Vice President Mike Pence asserted Friday that “all 50 states and territories across this country are opening up safely and responsibly” even as cases surge in many states, and eight states across the country have paused their reopening efforts. One state, Texas, has even  scaled back  their reopening plan, closing bars after they had been a part of the states reopening plan. Pence said at the White House coronavirus task force briefing Friday that the country has “made truly remarkable progress in moving our nation forward” and that “we've all seen the encouraging news as we open up America again.” His remarks come as 32 states across the country have seen an increase in cases over the past week, according to data from John Hopkins University.  Pence also discussed the return of jobs that came with reopening America, and said that some of the original coronavirus hotspots such as the New York metro area and New Orleans have made “extraordinary progress.” He said the task force is focusing on 16 states that have been most impacted by coronavirus in recent weeks with both rising cases and rising positivity rates. Pence also repeated the President's refrain that more testing has led to more cases, however the rise in new cases has outpaced the increase in coronavirus testing. “To one extent or another, the volume of new cases coming in is a reflection of a great success in expanding testing across the country,” Pence said. Pence said that while the US has made progress, the country “still has work to do.” Watch:

  5:38 p.m. ET, June 26, 2020 Young Americans "have a particular responsibility" to not spread coronavirus to vulnerable populations Vice President Mike Pence speaks at a coronavirus task force briefing in Washington, DC, on June 26. Pool 
  Vice President Mike Pence said that while it is "encouraging news" that new cases of coronavirus are increasingly among young Americans, young people also "have a particular responsibility" to ensure they're not spreading the virus to vulnerable populations. Pence said about half of news cases among people under the age of 35, "which is at a certain level, very encouraging news, as the experts tell us." Pence said. Yesterday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the pandemic has  moved into younger populations  — a change that could mean less serious illness and lower rates of death. "As we know, so far in this pandemic, younger Americans are less susceptible to serious outcomes of the coronavirus," Pence said at an ongoing coronavirus task force briefing. However, Pence added that young Americans must be careful to not spread the virus to older or more vulnerable people. "Younger Americans have a particular responsibility to make sure that they're not carrying the coronavirus into settings where they would expose the most vulnerable," he said. 
  The risk of serious complications and death rises with age, the CDC says, although there's no clear age cutoff for higher or lower risk. People with diabetes, kidney disease, moderate to severe asthma, and obesity are also at higher risk. Watch:

  5:26 p.m. ET, June 26, 2020 Pence: Coronavirus cases starting to "rise precipitously" across the South Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged that the country is now seeing coronavirus cases "rise precipitously" across the South.  “We stand here today because with the rising cases among southern states, President Trump asked us to brief the American people, to give details on what we're seeing, what we're doing, and how it's different from two months ago,” Pence said at the opening of the coronavirus task force briefing. 
  Pence added that according to data used by the task force, there are "16 states with rising cases and rising percentages." "We want to move America forward, even while we take and continue to take the steps necessary to protect lives and the health of the American people," Pence said.  According to data from John Hopkins University, at least 32 states are reporting an  increase in new coronavirus cases  in the past week compared to the previous week. Of those, 11 states — including Florida, Texas and Arizona — have seen a 50% increase or more. New cases are declining in just seven states: Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire and South Dakota. Watch:
