  WASHINGTON — Louisiana became the first state Friday to postpone an election due to  the coronavirus outbreak , saying it will push back its April 4 primary, in which Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will face off, until June 20.
  The action comes as election officials across the country are  taking steps  to mitigate voters' exposure to the virus in upcoming votes in the Democratic presidential primary and local races.
   "The two-month delay of this election will continue to allow our office to procure necessary supplies to put our state in best possible posture for the time when this election is conducted," Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said at a press conference Friday, adding that municipal general elections, previously scheduled for May 9, will now take place on July 25.
  Ardoin said the decision was made especially with local election commissioners in mind. Over half of them are 65 or older, he said, a population that is at heightened risk for the COVID-19 disease.
