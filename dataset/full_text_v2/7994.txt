  3:08 p.m. ET, April 6, 2020 Milwaukee mayor says he supports delaying Wisconsin primary From CNN's Elise Hammond Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers just  ordered a suspension of his state's primary election  just one day before it was scheduled to take place. Evers issued an  executive order  delaying tomorrow's primary until June 9, unless he and the legislature approve of a different date. He said in the order that "no Wisconsinite should ever have to choose between exercising their constitutional right to vote and being safe, secure, and healthy." Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said he was proud of the governor and agrees that going forward with the election would put many people at risk. "I can't ask people to go in-person vote if I think they're putting their lives on the line. I can't do that," Barrett told CNN's Anderson Cooper. 
  The delay will be challenged:  Some Republican state legislative leaders say they will ask the state Supreme Court to block the order. In a joint statement, state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, both Republicans, said they were challenging Evers' executive order in the Wisconsin Supreme Court and that local clerks should "stand ready to proceed with the election." If courts allow Evers to delay the primary, his move could avert the need for the Wisconsin National Guard to man polling places Tuesday as poll workers quit due to the coronavirus pandemic. Wisconsin had been the only one of 11 states with April primaries that was moving forward with in-person voting, after the other 10 either delayed their primaries or shifted to by-mail only voting.

In lieu of live classes, Peloton will offer new, pre-recorded sessions as well as on-demand content. Peloton sells $2,000-plus indoor fitness bikes. Customers pay $39 a month in subscription fees to participate in live classes.

  2:53 p.m. ET, April 6, 2020 New York official whose mother died from coronavirus: "Trump has blood on his hands" From CNN's Elise Hammond Scott Stringer CNN 
  Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller whose mother died from coronavirus, said he is angry at the federal government's response to the pandemic. "Donald Trump has blood on his hands and my mom's blood on his hands and he sent us that hospital that's right here in the Manhattan harbor and no one will get on that hospital," Stringer said.  
  About the ship:  The USNS Comfort hospital ship docked in New York City last week. The original plan was for the the ship to treat non-coronavirus patients to ease the strain on area hospitals seeing an influx of infected patients. But today, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he believes the right move is for the ship to utilize its 1000-bed capacity to battle the coronavirus. Trump has  said the ship could be used for coronavirus patients  if needed. Stringer said his mother was a strong woman and the only way he was able to get closure was through an outpouring of texts and support from strangers. "The government is supposed to protect our people and we're supposed to be able to protect our parents and grandparents the way they protected us and we're not able to do that," Stringer said.

  2:07 p.m. ET, April 6, 2020 Georgia governor says beaches are important for residents "physical and mental health" From CNN's Natasha Chen  Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp speaks during a news conference in downtown Atlanta on April 1. Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/AP/FILE 
  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said the state's beaches are an important option for residents to "maintain their physical and mental health." He issued the statement today to reiterate his stance on  opening the state's beaches.  Kemp said state troopers and local law enforcement are working to make sure those visiting the beaches are abiding by the shelter-in-place order. Visitors are not allowed to bring chairs, umbrellas, coolers or other items that encourage group activity. “During these difficult times, it is vitally important for Georgians to have safe options to maintain their physical and mental health while also abiding by social distancing," Kemp said.  
  Kemp said most people followed the rules this weekend and patrols reminded people "to follow social distancing or disperse."  He issued a shelter-in-place order on April 2, which supersedes all local orders placed previously.  Following the order, Georgia Department of Natural Resources signed an administrative order Friday on the use of beaches in Georgia. Georgia's Tybee Island Mayor, Shirley Sessions, announced in a written statement Saturday that she and the Tybee City Council will pursue legal avenues to overturn Kemp's "reckless mandate" to reopen beaches in the state.
