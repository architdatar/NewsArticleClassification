  Maine Gov. Janet Mills on Tuesday issued a  "stay healthy at home mandate"  that requires people to stay at their residence except for essential work or needs like groceries and health care.
  The order is aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus illness COVID-19, which has been linked to five deaths in the state as of Tuesday evening. Other states and local governments have announced similar orders.
  Essential businesses that remain open must enforce social distancing and in-person instruction at schools has been stopped until at least May 1.
  "We are in the midst of one of the greatest public health crises this world has seen in more than a century," Mills said, and she implored people to stay home. There have been 303 confirmed cases in Maine, with 68 people having recovered, according  to the state health department , but the agency notes that is likely an undercount of the true number of cases.
