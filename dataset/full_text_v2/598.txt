  Around 3 million more workers filed for unemployment benefits for the first time last week, down slightly from 3.8 million the previous week.
  More than 33 million Americans have now filed for initial jobless claims since the coronavirus pandemic ripped through the economy, according to data released Thursday by the Department of Labor.
  Continuing claims, or the number of people receiving ongoing benefits,  is now at more than 22 million,  far surpassing the recessionary peak of 6.6 million.
  Thursday's jobless-claims number comes before  the closely watched monthly employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , which will be released Friday morning.
  In an interview with Savannah Guthrie on NBC's "TODAY" show Thursday morning, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, said Friday's official unemployment rate "will probably be something like 16 or 17 percent — but it will understate how bad the damage has been. I think the real number is probably around 23 or 24 percent. It's devastating."
  However, he added, "I don't think we're actually headed for another Great Depression," predicting instead a "a long, gradual recovery" whose pace will be dictated by the coronavirus.
