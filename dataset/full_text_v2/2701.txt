  A doctor in Spain is tweeting daily updates of life under quarantine with coronavirus, even sharing ultrasounds of his lungs. 
  Yale Tung Chen , 35, said over the phone that he contracted coronavirus while treating patients in his work as an emergency physician at Hospital Universitario La Paz in Madrid. 
  He was diagnosed on Sunday and has been in quarantine in his home in Madrid ever since. 
   
  Day 1 after  #COVID  diagnosis. Sore throat, headache (strong!), Dry cough but not shortness of breath. No lung US abnormalities. Will keep a  #POCUS  track of my lungs.  #coronavirus  ⁦ @TomasVillen ⁩ ⁦ @ButterflyNetInc ⁩  pic.twitter.com/wLtSc70pxQ 
  Chen said he wanted his experience to be educational, but wasn't expecting the compassionate response he received from social media users. “It meant the whole world to me to receive support from people all around the world,” he said.
