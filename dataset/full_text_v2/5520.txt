  Production of an Elvis biopic featuring Tom Hanks has been officially postponed, its makers said Friday.
  "Despite valiant efforts, due to current world events, production on the Elvis film cannot proceed at this time," a Warner Bros. spokesperson said. "We will commence principal photography once circumstances permit."
  On March 11,Â  Hanks said on social media that he and his wife had tested positive  for COVID-19 and were isolating themselves in Australia, where the movie was being shot at a Warner Bros. satellite studio.
  Filming was  reportedly  stopped around that time. Director Baz Luhrmann said on  Twitter  Friday, "We are not even taking our sets down, simply locking up the creative space over the next few days."
