  3:41 p.m. ET, June 22, 2020 Saudi Arabia says annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will have limited participants  From CNN’s Hamdi Alkhshali and Larry Register  Because of the coronavirus pandemic, this year's Hajj pilgrimage will have a very limited numbers of pilgrims, according to state run Saudi Press Agency. The Hajj is an  annual pilgrimage to Mecca  in Saudi Arabia. Islam requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. A statement from the Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah said that as Covid-19 cases continue to grow globally, it was decided the Hajj will “take place this year with a limited number of pilgrims from all nationalities residing in Saudi Arabia only who are willing to perform Hajj.” “This decision is taken to ensure Hajj is safely performed while committing to all preventive measures to protect Muslims and adhere strictly to the teachings of Islam in preserving our health and safety,” according to the statement. 
  The ministry's statement cited the Saudi Ministry of Health saying, “the risks from Coronavirus are expected to grow further, but there is no vaccine available yet for those infected by the disease." The statement noted that it is challenging to maintain a proper distance in crowded areas. More than 2 million Muslims performed Hajj last year, with more than 1.8 million pilgrims traveled to Saudi Arabia from abroad to take part. Performing the Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and it is one of the biggest religious gatherings in the world.  The Hajj is scheduled to start at the end of July this year.

  The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), which runs the New York City subway system,  has used $2.9 billion of the March  funding from the Federal CARES Act  which represents about 73% of the money, but expects to exhaust the remaining funding in early July. “The MTA is facing the most acute financial crisis in its history,” MTA Chief Financial Officer Bob Foran said in a press release.  He continued:  “With more than 70% of the CARES funding provided in the first relief package drawn down, and all CARES funding expected to be exhausted early next month, our finances are on life support."  He called on Congress to act to protect the MTA "We need the Senate to take action now and follow the House of Representatives’ leadership on continued pandemic funding. As the MTA is the lifeblood of New York and the nation’s economy – our financial health will be critical to the country’s economic recovery," he said. Foran added, "New York is also the top donor state in the nation providing $29 billion more in funding than we get back from the federal government."  "We urge the Senate to come back to Washington, do its job and provide another $3.9 billion in funding to the MTA now to cover the rest of 2020.” 
  The latest ridership numbers:  The MTA says more than 2 million people rode New York City subways and buses on Friday, the first time ridership has reached that level since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March. While it’s a significant increase in ridership, it’s a decline of 74% from normal weekday ridership levels of 7.6 million, the MTA added.

  2:53 p.m. ET, June 22, 2020 Los Angeles Health director says she is receiving death threats From CNN's Cheri Mossburg Death threats have been directed at Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the Los Angeles County Public Health director, over COVID-19 orders. “The death threats started last month during a COVID-19 Facebook Live public briefing when someone very casually suggested I should be shot,” Ferrer said in a statement. “I didn’t immediately see the message, but my husband did, my children did, and so did my colleagues.” 
  Ferrer said that health officers across the country "are being threatened with violence on a regular basis." Since March, the team at L.A. County Health has been attacked via email, public postings, and letters, she said. Orange County’s Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick resigned earlier this month after she received threats to her personal safety. Ferrer acknowledged the frustration and anger over the virus and urges the public to “follow the science in order to save lives.”

Those who tested positive have been isolated, and others who may have been exposed have been quarantined, according to the university's statement.   “While we have experienced an increase in positive tests, almost all are related to individuals who had been in quarantine due to our contact tracing and developed symptoms,” stated Dr. Andrew Peterson, UI associate professor and head team physician. “Our overall process, including testing and daily health screening, is working as expected.”

  2:05 p.m. ET, June 22, 2020 White House says Trump has not directed a slow down in testing, claims he was speaking "in jest"  From CNN's Nikki Carvajal  White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Source: Pool 
  White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said President Trump was speaking “in jest” when he said during his  rally Saturday  that he asked administration officials to slow down testing for Covid-19 in the US.  McEnany was asked if the President actually made that request during a press briefing on Monday. “He has not directed that, and in fact I would note that first we continue to test about 500,000 per day, about half a million people per day,” McEnany answered. “$1.8 billion dollars is invested in NIH to find new testing capabilities, any suggestion that testing has been curtailed is not rooted in fact.” 
  “It was a comment that he made in jest,” McEnany added. “It’s a comment that he made in passing, specifically with regard to the media coverage and pointing out the fact that the media never acknowledges that we have more cases because when you test more people you find more cases.” Asked if it was appropriate for Trump to joke about coronavirus when more than 100,000 Americans have died of the virus, McEnany denied it he was joking about the virus. “He was not joking about coronavirus. I just said he was joking about the media and their failure to understand the fact that when you test more, you also find more cases,” she said. Earlier Monday, Trump did not directly answer when asked by a Scripps reporter if he had requested to pare back testing. “If it did slow down, frankly, I think we’re way ahead of ourselves if you want to know the truth,” Trump said. “We’ve done too good a job.” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins later asked McEnany about Trump’s comments. McEnany responded that “the President instead used that opportunity to extoll the fact that we’ve done 25 million tests.”

  During a morning phone call with governors, Vice President Mike Pence was questioned by Nevada's Democratic governor about President Trump’s claims about slowing down coronavirus testing, according to a person familiar with the call. Pence said Trump made the remark as a “passing observation,” the person said. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak told Pence the comment was unhelpful. What this is about:  At his rally in Tulsa on Saturday, Trump said: "When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people, slow the testing down, please." On the call with governors, Pence repeated his assertion that more testing means more positive cases. He also called on the governors of certain states with an increase in cases to describe their response efforts.
