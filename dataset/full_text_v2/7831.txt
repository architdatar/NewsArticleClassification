  A U.K. government minister has been tested for coronavirus after appearing unwell during a speech in Parliament Wednesday. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, was seen mopping his brow several times. 
  The virus scare comes just days after many  lawmakers returned to parliament  following the end of arrangements — in place since April — that had allowed them to debate and vote online.
  MPs were highly critical of plans, with the opposition Labour Party condemning plans to force MPs with  "shielding responsibilities"  to vote in person. Opposition lawmaker Tulip Siddiq claimed the situation in parliament was  "chaos ."
  Under the U.K.'s new track and trace system, should Sharma test positive, individuals who had come into close contact with him will be asked to self-isolate for two weeks.
