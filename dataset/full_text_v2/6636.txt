  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he still hopes to reach a Senate deal on a coronavirus stimulus plan today. “I would just say we’re trying to finalize all the documents. Going through a lot of complicated issues and we’re making a lot of progress," he said as he went from one meeting to another moments ago. “Again we’re trying to get a deal as quick as we get a deal. So, I hope it’s tonight. Absolutely. Still think we can get there," he said when asked if there would be a deal tonight.  Where things stand now:  Pressure has been intensifying for days on the Senate to pass a massive stimulus package to respond to the economic fallout of the  coronavirus , but yesterday came and went  without much action. After four straight days of marathon negotiations, the Trump administration and senators again failed to secure an agreement on a roughly $2 trillion plan to provide a jolt to the economy and give aid to hard-hit workers and industries. Leaders emerged from late-night meetings in the Capitol optimistic that a deal could be struck today.

  2:32 p.m. ET, March 24, 2020 Canada's Trudeau says he may impose further border restrictions with US  From CNN’s Paula Newton  Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP 
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he and his officials will "shift our posture," if necessary, when it comes to stricter border controls with the United States.  “We are braced for a broad range of scenarios, we have put contingency plans for next steps depending on what trajectory the virus takes in Canada or indeed around the world,"  said Trudeau during his daily news conference outside his Ottawa home where he remains in quarantine.  "We are looking at a broad range of things nothing is off the table but we will respond every step of the way with the necessary actions," he said. 
  Border states including Washington and New York have become Covid-19 hotspots and Canadian officials are becoming more concerned about community spread as hundreds of thousands of Canadians return to the country from the US and beyond. The Public Health Agency of Canada says it has tested more than 120,000 Canadians to date and there’s an almost equal mix of travel-related and community spread cases across the country. Canada now has at least 2,500 cases of the virus, with cases spiking by at least 25% Tuesday alone. Canada has reported 25 deaths.

  2:24 p.m. ET, March 24, 2020 Sierra Leone declares 12-month state of "public health emergency" From CNN’s Bukola Adebayo in Lagos Sierra Leone President Julius Maada Bio declared a 12-month state of “public health emergency” starting Tuesday in the West African nation to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It has yet to report a case. Bio, in a televised address to the nation, expressed concerns about the rapid spread of the virus, warning that it could send Sierra Leone into “a state of emergency.” The country was at the center of the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak that ended with more than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. The President said the coronavirus pandemic poses “enormous” health and economic challenge to citizens and the country’s health facilities and it has become necessary for the government to take critical steps to protect its citizens. He offered no immediate details on what those steps would be during the address. Bio did say the announcement is not a lockdown and warned against hoarding and hiking of goods and services in the country. “This is not a lockdown and nobody must use this as an excuse to hoard goods, hike prices, or engage in acts of lawlessness. This public emergency is not meant to make the lives of Sierra Leoneans difficult or unbearable,” he said. 
  Bio said the government would deploy police and country’s security forces to ensure that citizens comply with public health directives in the country. “We believe that the actions that we take as a government, will have an impact on the well-being of our beloved nation,” the President said. Sierra Leone had banned overseas travel for public officials last week and prohibited gathering of more than 100 people as a precautionary measure against the virus.

  2:08 p.m. ET, March 24, 2020 Trump says that he and coronavirus task force doctor "get along very well" From CNN's Maegan Vazquez  Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images 
    President Trump said Tuesday that he still has a good relationship with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the coronavirus task force member who leads the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases.  “We get along very well,” Trump said during a Fox News virtual town hall. 
  “I think it’s very good,” he said of his relationship with Fauci. “You would have heard about it if it wasn’t.” Asked why Fauci wasn’t at the town hall today, Trump said, “You know, they have other things to do. And yesterday we weren’t really talking about what he’s an expert on. We were talking about other things.” The President complained that when a task force member isn’t seen at a briefing or meeting, the press is quick to ask why they aren’t there. “I respect all of these people. These are great people,” Trump said. He called Dr. Deborah Birx and Fauci “extraordinary.” Earlier in the town hall, Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams asserted that the President listens to his health experts, including Fauci, about the coronavirus.
