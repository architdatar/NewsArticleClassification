  Vice President Mike Pence offered his condolences as the U.S. coronavirus death toll rose to six on Monday.
  Pence spoke to reporters Monday afternoon along with a number of experts on the White House coronavirus task force, where he emphasized that people should remain calm amid the outbreak. 
  "Despite today’s sad news, let’s be clear: the risk to the American people from the coronavirus remains low, according to all of the experts that we’re working with across the government," Pence said.
  The vice president called the outbreak an "all hands on deck" situation as he recounted meetings with governors, pharmaceutical companies and medical experts in recent days.
  Pence said that while a vaccine might not be available until late this year or early next, pharmaceutical companies have been working on developing therapeutics that may be available as early as this summer. 
  "The most encouraging news from that meeting are that our pharma companies ... all have already formed a consortium to work together, to share information in the development of therapeutics and vaccines," he said. 
  The administration has worked with authorities in Italy and South Korea to implement additional screenings for all flights entering the U.S., including temperature tests for passengers.
  Pence didn't warn against domestic travel, but encouraged families to practice common sense as authorities encourage everyone to resume their normal lives.
  "This is a time to use common sense," Pence said. "It's a good time to wash your hands."
