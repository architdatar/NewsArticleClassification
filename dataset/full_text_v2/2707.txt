  The Nicaraguan Citizens' Covid-19 Observatory, an independent network that includes health care professionals who are tallying coronavirus cases, reported nearly five times more cases in the country than the government's tally, according to numbers released by the Observatory Saturday. Nicaragua's government reported 1,118 cases and 46 deaths from the novel coronavirus on June 2. The Citizens' Observatory has in turn reported 5,027 suspected coronavirus cases and 1,015 Covid-19 deaths. The Observatory also reported 458 health workers with Covid-19 symptoms and 48 deaths suspected from the virus among health care personnel. The Nicaraguan government maintains its position of not issuing confinement measures nor shutting the economy, arguing that 40% of the population lives in the countryside and 80% of the urban population are self-employed.  In statements to official media on June 5, Nicaragua's Vice President Rosario Murillo announced at least 2,000 activities of the Family Economy program, which includes markets and food sales, would still take place this weekend.

  While states  lift more restrictions  and more Americans go out to socialize or  protest , almost half of US states are seeing higher rates of new coronavirus cases. But the situation would have been much worse had states not shut down,  a new study  says. More than 1.9 million Americans have been infected, and  more than 110,000 have died  in just over four months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Some states are seeing increases:  Nationwide,  22 states are seeing upward  trends in coronavirus cases. About 20 states have seen decreases in recent days, and eight states are holding steady.  One of the states with the biggest spikes in new cases is Florida. The number of new cases reported each day has increased an average of roughly  46% over the past week , just as  most of the state entered a second phase of reopening . While big cities on the coasts were hit hard early in the pandemic, the  past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states , including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona. In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases "very concerning (and) approaching exponential." "Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%)," she  tweeted  over the weekend. Friday, health officials in Utah said they were "very concerned" about the rise in new cases over the past week. The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.

  Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday that he is ordering an independent review of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic by state nursing homes. The review will be conducted by a third party and will incorporate a “top-to-bottom analysis of all elements of the pandemic and how it was addressed in these facilities.” "Our state took proactive and innovative steps to address the outbreak in our long-term care facilities, but we must take steps to better understand how prepared the system was, and then review the steps that were taken once the virus was clearly present across the state,” Lamont said in a statement. 
  The governor said that he wants the review completed by the fall in order to be prepared for a possible second wave of coronavirus.

  3:57 p.m. ET, June 8, 2020 Major League Baseball's latest proposal calls for 76-game season From CNN's David Close Major League Baseball is proposing a 76-game season in the league’s latest idea to save the 2020 season, per ESPN. The report details the latest proposal by the owners sent to the players union Monday morning. ESPN, citing an unnamed source familiar with the negotiations, says in addition to a shortened season, the players would receive 75% of their prorated salaries. Last week, the league reportedly rejected a Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) proposal which offered a 114-game season with players receiving their full prorated salaries. In a statement on June 4, MLBPA Director Tony Clark said the players would resoundingly reject any proposals that asked for further reductions in salaries. Neither MLB or MLBPA have responded to CNN’s request for details or comment. Some context:  In May, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred appeared on CNN and  expressed hope that a new season could be salvaged .  “I think it’s hopeful that we will have some Major League Baseball this summer…Me, personally, I have great confidence that we'll reach an agreement with the players association both that it's safe to come back to work and work out the economic issues that need to be resolved," Manfred said. 
  When asked about the economic impact if there was no MLB baseball this season, Manfred told CNN that losses would be “devastating” and would result in losses approaching $4 billion. Hear more:
