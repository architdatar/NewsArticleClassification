  The Bureau of Prisons is suspending inmate visits at all 122 federal correctional facilities for at least 30 days, the agency announced Friday.
  The directive applies to friends and family members of prisoners, as well as lawyers. But exceptions will be made to attorneys on a case-by-case basis, the agency said.
  The move is the most dramatic yet taken by the federal prison system to combat the spread of the coronavirus. 
  Several state correctional departments announced on Thursday a suspension of inmate visits. The nation’s prisons and jails are  especially vulnerable to outbreaks , experts say, due to the close confinement of inmates and often grimy conditions.
