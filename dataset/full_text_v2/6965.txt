  President Donald Trump authorized a "robust assistance package" to help Italy, a country hit particularly  hard by the coronavirus , fight the outbreak, according to a statement from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday. 
  "This will include support for international organizations and NGOs, including faith-based organizations, many of which are already providing essential relief to Italian communities," Pompeo said. 
  Pompeo also said that the roughly 30,000 U.S. military personnel and families living in Italy would "assist with a variety of functions, including providing telemedicine services, facilitating the transport and assembly of field hospitals and equipment, treating non-COVID-19 patients, and supporting transport of supplies, fuel, and food."
