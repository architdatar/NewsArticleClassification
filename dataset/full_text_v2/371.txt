  A  temporary restraining order  filed Monday in Louisiana federal court seeks to compel the Oakdale federal prison complex — where  six inmates have died  after contracting the coronavirus — to expedite the release of inmates who are most vulnerable to infection.
  Prison officials pledged last week to release elderly prisoners and those with pre-existing health conditions on a case-by-case basis — a move that the American Civil Liberties Union, which is suing Oakdale and the federal Bureau of Prisons, considers too slow. Among those who have died was a  man imprisoned on a nonviolent drug charge .
  So far, at least 38 inmates and 17 staff have tested positive for COVID-19 at Oakdale, which is more than any other federal facility.
  In its request, the ACLU says a temporary restraining order is "the only way to ensure that Defendants' plan to lockdown Plaintiffs in a tinderbox of infection is not a fait accompli before this Court has the opportunity to pass judgment on it."
  The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment about pending litigation, but stressed that the agency is  working to place hundreds of inmates  in states hit hardest by the coronavirus on home confinement where appropriate.
