  Waffle House has declared "Index Red," as it closes more than fifth of its stores in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
  Waffle House's approximately 2,000 restaurants are  usually open 24 hours, seven days a week, 365 days a year . Now, 418 locations are closed, a Waffle House Facebook post said Tuesday.
  The  Waffle House Index  refers to the measure of destruction caused by a natural disaster based on how many Waffle Houses remain open or have closed.
