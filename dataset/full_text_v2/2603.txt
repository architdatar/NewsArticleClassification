  Italy's death toll from coronavirus continues to mount, reaching 233.
  The number of cases in the country is now at 5,883, with close to half that number — 2,651 — hospitalized. 
  The outbreak, one of the worst outside China, is centered in the Lombardy region, which includes Milan. 
  In praising the American response to coronavirus, Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday noted that the United States was "screening 100 percent of all individuals from all flights from Italy."
