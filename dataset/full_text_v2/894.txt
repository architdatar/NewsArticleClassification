  8:26 p.m. ET, June 22, 2020 Blood-thinner pill could reduce Covid-19 complications, study shows From CNN’s Maggie Fox A pill people usually taken to prevent blood clots helped reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other problems caused by blood clots in hospital patients, researchers reported Monday. They gave the drug, sold under the brand name Xarelto, to 4,900 patients who had been treated and then sent home from the Feinstein Institutes at New York’s large Northwell Health hospital system.  They gave placebos to 4,900 other discharged coronavirus patients. Each group was followed for about six weeks. Patients given Xarelto, known generically as rivaroxaban, had a 28% reduced risk of a blood clot in the leg, known as a deep vein thrombosis, Northwell’s Alex Spyropoulos and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. And their risk of other blood clots known as venous thromboembolisms, heart attacks, strokes or other types of heart death were 28% lower than patients who went home with dummy pills.  The patients were on average about 68 years old, and there didn’t seem to be an increase in bleeding problems – a known side effect of the drug. “We are encouraged by the study’s results to potentially reduce these life-threatening thromboembolic episodes by expanding the use of rivaroxaban for patients post-hospitalization,” Spyropolous said in a statement. “Through this research, Northwell Health has adapted its treatment policy for discharged COVID-19 patients, and others at risk, across the health system.”  Increased blood clotting throughout the body is a known symptom of coronavirus infection, and doctors have been trying out various blood thinners in patients to see if they can help safely.

  4:20 p.m. ET, June 22, 2020 Louisiana will not move to phase 3 at the end of the week as planned, governor says Louisiana will not be moving to phase three at the end of the week like expected, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced in a press conference. The state will remain in phase two under a new order that will be signed later this week and extended for 28 days, he said.  Louisiana has seen a rise in cases and hospitalizations. Edwards said that due to this and the community spread that is happening, it is not safe for the state to move out of phase two at this time. Phase two allowed restaurants, malls, gyms and other businesses to open with reduced capacity,  according to the state's website. Edwards said the number of community spread cases is increasing among younger people and they have seen clusters around bars and graduation parties that happened in the past few weeks. “Some had hoped, thought, believed that this virus would go away once we got to the summer. It is very clear that is not happening, and not going to happen. A lot of people are saying ‘They are done with virus’ – well the virus isn’t done with us,” Edwards said.

  3:41 p.m. ET, June 22, 2020 Saudi Arabia says annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will have limited participants  From CNN’s Hamdi Alkhshali and Larry Register  Because of the coronavirus pandemic, this year's Hajj pilgrimage will have a very limited numbers of pilgrims, according to state run Saudi Press Agency. The Hajj is an  annual pilgrimage to Mecca  in Saudi Arabia. Islam requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. A statement from the Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah said that as Covid-19 cases continue to grow globally, it was decided the Hajj will “take place this year with a limited number of pilgrims from all nationalities residing in Saudi Arabia only who are willing to perform Hajj.” “This decision is taken to ensure Hajj is safely performed while committing to all preventive measures to protect Muslims and adhere strictly to the teachings of Islam in preserving our health and safety,” according to the statement. 
  The ministry's statement cited the Saudi Ministry of Health saying, “the risks from Coronavirus are expected to grow further, but there is no vaccine available yet for those infected by the disease." The statement noted that it is challenging to maintain a proper distance in crowded areas. More than 2 million Muslims performed Hajj last year, with more than 1.8 million pilgrims traveled to Saudi Arabia from abroad to take part. Performing the Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and it is one of the biggest religious gatherings in the world.  The Hajj is scheduled to start at the end of July this year.

  The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), which runs the New York City subway system,  has used $2.9 billion of the March  funding from the Federal CARES Act  which represents about 73% of the money, but expects to exhaust the remaining funding in early July. “The MTA is facing the most acute financial crisis in its history,” MTA Chief Financial Officer Bob Foran said in a press release.  He continued:  “With more than 70% of the CARES funding provided in the first relief package drawn down, and all CARES funding expected to be exhausted early next month, our finances are on life support."  He called on Congress to act to protect the MTA "We need the Senate to take action now and follow the House of Representatives’ leadership on continued pandemic funding. As the MTA is the lifeblood of New York and the nation’s economy – our financial health will be critical to the country’s economic recovery," he said. Foran added, "New York is also the top donor state in the nation providing $29 billion more in funding than we get back from the federal government."  "We urge the Senate to come back to Washington, do its job and provide another $3.9 billion in funding to the MTA now to cover the rest of 2020.” 
  The latest ridership numbers:  The MTA says more than 2 million people rode New York City subways and buses on Friday, the first time ridership has reached that level since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March. While it’s a significant increase in ridership, it’s a decline of 74% from normal weekday ridership levels of 7.6 million, the MTA added.

  2:53 p.m. ET, June 22, 2020 Los Angeles Health director says she is receiving death threats From CNN's Cheri Mossburg Death threats have been directed at Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the Los Angeles County Public Health director, over COVID-19 orders. “The death threats started last month during a COVID-19 Facebook Live public briefing when someone very casually suggested I should be shot,” Ferrer said in a statement. “I didn’t immediately see the message, but my husband did, my children did, and so did my colleagues.” 
  Ferrer said that health officers across the country "are being threatened with violence on a regular basis." Since March, the team at L.A. County Health has been attacked via email, public postings, and letters, she said. Orange County’s Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick resigned earlier this month after she received threats to her personal safety. Ferrer acknowledged the frustration and anger over the virus and urges the public to “follow the science in order to save lives.”
