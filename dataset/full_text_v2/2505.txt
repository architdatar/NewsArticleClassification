  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak was "no time for politics" and called for national unity.
  “I have no political agenda," Cuomo said at his daily briefing in Albany. "It's no time for politics.” 
  Cuomo has gone back and forth with President Donald Trump , publicly disagreeing with the White House's response to the pandemic and at times drawing the ire of Trump. 
  Cuomo insisted that he had no interest in partisan politics during this time, saying "I work so hard to distance myself from it."
  “If you have partisan division splitting this nation now, it's going to make it worse,” he said.
