  Stock futures tumbled in overnight trading Sunday as investors continued to brace for the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus, while a shocking  all-out oil price war  added to the anxiety.
  Futures on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  plunged about 1,078 points, pointed to a more than 1,000-point loss at Monday’s open. The  S&P 500  futures indicated a 4 percent drop at the open. The sharp declines in the futures market signaled more turbulence ahead after a roller-coaster week that saw the S&P 500 swing up or down more than 2.5 percent for four days straight.
  Saudi Arabia on Saturday slashed official crude selling prices  for April, in a sudden U-turn from previous attempts to support the oil market as the coronavirus hammers global demand. The move came after OPEC talks collapsed Friday, prompting some strategists to see oil prices crater to $20 this year.
