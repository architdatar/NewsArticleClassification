During a news media availability at the White House on Tuesday, President Trump was presented with a comment he made more than two months ago.
  “Today the U.S. hit a grim milestone of 1 million cases of the  coronavirus ,” CNN’s Jim Acosta said. “Back in late February, you predicted that the number of cases would go down to zero. How did we get from your prediction of zero to 1 million?”
  “Well,” Trump replied, “it will go down to zero, ultimately.”
  This reply, while flippant, is not demonstrably incorrect. It may well be the case that the novel coronavirus is eventually eradicated entirely, though that’s trickier than it may seem. The flu strain at the center of the 1918 pandemic, for example,  still circulates  and is included in annual flu shots. Eradicating viruses entirely is hard to do, as doctors who have battled the spread of polio can attest.
  But while Trump’s reply demonstrates a remarkable optimism, it’s also completely disingenuous. His comments in February weren’t a vague assertion that the threat posed by the virus would pass. Instead, they were an assertion that the government was capably containing the virus and that the number of cases already presented would quickly winnow away.
  Obviously, he was wrong.
  That comment on Feb. 26 was not the first time he had claimed that the virus would simply dissipate.
  Feb. 10 . Said during a meeting with governors.  Cases at the end of that day, according to  data  from Johns Hopkins University: 12. 
  Note the prediction here:  The virus would go away by April. 
  Feb. 25.  Said during a roundtable in New Delhi.  Cases: 53.  
  Feb. 26.  Trump made the comment referred to by Acosta during a coronavirus news briefing.  Cases: 59 (including passengers repatriated from a cruise ship).  
  A key point here is that Trump  predicted the virus would go away within a couple of days.  So Trump’s “it will go down to zero, ultimately” clearly misrepresents what he said at the time.
  Feb. 27.  Said during a photo opportunity at the White House.  Cases: 60. 
  March 6.  Said during a bill signing.  Cases: 278. Deaths: 14. 
  March 10.  Said during a meeting on Capitol Hill.  Cases: 959. Deaths: 28.  
  March 12.  Said during a bilateral meeting.  Cases: 1,663. Deaths: 40. 
  Predicted to go away within two months. 
  March 30.  Said during a coronavirus news briefing.  Cases: 161,807. Deaths: 2,978. 
  March 31.  Said during a coronavirus news briefing.  Cases: 188,172. Deaths: 3,873. 
  Predicted to go away by the end of April. 
  April 3.  Said during a coronavirus news briefing.  Cases: 275,586. Deaths: 7,087. 
  April 7.  Said during a coronavirus news briefing.  Cases: 396,223. Deaths: 12,722. 
  April 28.  Later in Tuesday’s news conference, Trump again claimed that the virus would simply go away, just as he had two months and two days earlier, when there were those 15 cases that would be gone in a few days.
  The number of cases and deaths at the end of the day on April 28 is not yet known. As of writing, Johns Hopkins counts nearly 58,000 dead and 1,004,908 confirmed cases — nearly 67,000 cases for every case Trump discussed on Feb. 26.
