  Colorado Gov. Jared Polis announced in a press briefing on Wednesday that the state has been talking to Chinese factory owners, and others, to purchase medical equipment. "We know that not having gotten nearly enough from the federal government, we have really taken it upon ourselves as a state to engage in the purchasing of medical equipment," Polis said. 
  According to the governor, Colorado has a "monumental task" at hand to build medical capacity at this critical time. And the state is not just facing a healthcare crisis; it is also facing a supply chain crisis, Polis added. "We simply do not have the medical capacity, the beds, hospital beds, ICU units, ventilators, personal protection equipment to treat everybody who might get sick and have the potential to get better," the governor said. "We placed a number of purchase orders, and we have a number of supplies that are in transit or in the supply chain, all subject to verification. We want to verify that the masks work and that they are not counterfeit." By the numbers:  Colorado has ordered 2.5 million N95 Masks, 750 ventilators, 1.5 million gloves, one million surgical masks, 25,000 face shields and 250,000 gowns, according to the governor.  Colorado has a total of 3,338 coronavirus cases with 77 deaths, according to CNN's tally.

  5:59 p.m. ET, April 1, 2020 New report shares additional evidence that the coronavirus spreads before symptoms present From CNN's Gina Yu The spread of the novel coronavirus may occur before patients present with symptoms, according to a report released Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The transmission of the novel coronavirus before the development of symptoms might occur through respiratory droplets or indirect transmission, according to the report.   “These findings also suggest that to control the pandemic it might not be enough for only persons with symptoms to limit their contact with others because persons without symptoms might transmit infection,” the report said. "Evidence of presymptomatic transmission … underscores the critical role social distancing … plays in controlling the Covid-19 pandemic.”

  6:26 p.m. ET, April 1, 2020 Russian coronavirus aid arrives in New York From CNN's Kylie Atwood  A plane carrying medical supplies from Russia landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Wednesday, April 1. TASS/Getty Images 
  Russian medical supplies to help the US combat the Covid-19 pandemic landed in New York on Wednesday afternoon, the Russian mission to the UN tweeted out. The mission tweeted that the supplies would “help local communities and hospitals in their crucial action against the spread of #coronanvirus.” The New York Air Traffic Controller thanked the Russian pilot when the plane landed at JFK airport.  “Romeo Foxtrot Foxtrot 8460 Heavy, we sincerely thank you for all the assistance you are bringing in,” the controller said. “Have a good day.” 
  The shipment includes personal protective equipment including masks, ventilators, and antiseptics a State Department official told CNN. The US will put all Food and Drug Administration approved items to immediate use, a senior administration official said on Tuesday.  Some context:  The shipment comes just days after President Trump and President Vladimir Putin spoke over the phone.  The Russian assistance was not mentioned in the readout of their call provided by the White House. But earlier this week Trump said that "Russia sent us a very, very large planeload of things, medical equipment, which was very nice." Last month, before that phone call, the State Department urged diplomats worldwide to ask for medical supplies from their host countries, but said that they would not be asking Russia.

  5:23 p.m. ET, April 1, 2020 National stockpile deploys its last round of shipments From CNN's Kristen Holmes The Strategic National Stockpile is deploying the last round of shipments in its inventory, depleting the bulk of its protective gear, a source familiar told CNN. The official said the stockpile was never meant to serve as the only source of protective gear for the entire coronavirus response and the states would need to get more supply from the private market.  The official stressed that the stockpile, which is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services, will never be completely depleted as they always retain a small percentage for the most critical needs.  Some context:  Since the start of the pandemic, officials have been sounding the alarm that there was never going to be enough gear for a 50-state response. On Tuesday, President Trump said the government would hold onto 10,000 ventilators to ensure they had the ability to deploy quickly if they need the units in the future. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said the agency's planning for the Covid-19 pandemic response "acknowledged that the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) alone could not fulfill all requirements at the State and tribal level. Therefore, as the vice president stated last night, the federal government will exhaust all means to identify and attain medical and other supplies needed to combat the virus." A Department of Homeland Security official told CNN the stockpile is "near depletion because the numbers are low." "When you see demand is outpacing supply, then we go to the people [states] who are asking for equipment and ask if they are exhausting all of their sources," the official said. "We are having to balance places that don't have any [PPE], versus someone on the verge, but not there yet."

  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said religious services conducted in churches, synagogues and houses of worship are “essential business” and therefore exempt from this stay-at-home executive order announced this afternoon.  The stay-at-home order issued by DeSantis goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Friday.  According to 2019 Census data, the population of the state has over 21 million people. Florida has 6,946 confirmed coronavirus cases and 86 deaths, according to CNN's  tally . Some context:  Pastor Rodney  Howard-Browne said he wouldn't close  the doors of his Tampa, Florida, megachurch until the End Times begin. The police weren't willing to wait that long. On Monday, Florida sheriff's deputies arrested the evangelical pastor, who has continued to host large church services despite public orders urging residents to stay home to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said Howard-Browne has been charged with two counts: unlawful assembly and a violation of health emergency rules. Both are second-degree misdemeanors, Chronister said at a press conference Monday.

  As states around the country issue  "stay-at-home" orders amid the coronavirus  pandemic, firearm and ammunition retailers have been designated an "essential service," according to updated guidance from the federal government.  Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, identified "firearm and ammunition product manufacturers, retailers, importers, distributors, and shooting ranges" as critical infrastructure in the updated "Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce" advisory, which was issued over the weekend. The list is intended to be advisory and not to be considered "the exclusive list of critical infrastructure sectors, workers, and functions that should continue during the Covid-19 response across all jurisdictions." "Individual jurisdictions should add or subtract essential workforce categories based on their own requirements and discretion," the advisory states. Some context:  The Covid-19 health crisis has prompted at least 30 states and the District of Columbia to issue stay-at-home orders that force the closure of "non-essential services." Firearm retailers haven't been specifically mentioned in some states' lists of essential businesses, so they're assumed to be non-essential.
