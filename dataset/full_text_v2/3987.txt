  Schools across the UK will close from Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced Wednesday.  They are expected to shut at the end of the school day on Friday, and remain closed until further notice. The closures will affect students of all ages, except for the children of key workers -- including NHS staff, police and delivery drivers – and vulnerable children. “ We therefore need schools to make provisions for the children of these key workers … and they also need to look after the most vulnerable children,” Johnson said during his daily coronavirus press conference. “For many parents, these steps will be frustrating," Johnson conceded. "That’s why we are now working on further measures… to keep our economy going."

  1:35 p.m. ET, March 18, 2020 Internal Delta memo: Airline to "hit the pause button" on some operations From CNN's Greg Wallace and Kylie Atwood  Bruce Bennett/Getty Images/FILE 
  Delta needs to “essentially hit the ‘pause button’” on some of its operations, CEO Ed Bastian told employees in a memo Wednesday, making further major cuts to its operations that include parking more than half of its aircraft.  The company’s cuts include cutting back 70% of its capacity, further pay cuts for executives and company leadership, as well as paring back its operations in airports around the country – including its major hub in Atlanta.   “With fewer customers flying, we need less space in airports,” Bastian wrote. “Among other initiatives, we will temporarily consolidate airport facilities in Atlanta and other locations as necessary and close the majority of our Delta Sky Clubs until demand recovers.” 
  “We are reducing our active fleet size by parking at least half of our fleet – more than 600 aircraft,” he wrote, as well as retiring older planes.  He also said “roughly 10,000” employees have volunteered to take leaves of absence.  Bastian did not announce any layoffs, but he did not count out the possibility. “I know everyone is concerned about the security of your jobs and pay. Given the uncertainty about the duration of this crisis, we are not yet at a point to make any decisions," Bastian wrote. Some context:  Bastian's message followed a telephone call he and executives at other US airlines held with President Trump to discuss the state of the industry and its request for billions of dollars of government financial assistance.   Bastian said the discussions have been "constructive."
