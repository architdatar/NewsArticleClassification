  As Italy enters its first weekend under a countrywide lockdown, residents in the city of Siena found a new way to connect with one another: through song. 
  In a Twitter video that already has more than 1.5 million views, Italians singing from their balconies in unison. “E mentre Siena dorme” (“And While Siena Sleeps”), is a traditional folk song for the people of Siena, usually sung to show local pride. 
  "In Siena, the city to which I am very attached, you stay at home but you sing together as if you were on the street," wrote  one of the Twitter users who shared the video . "I was moved."
  A Siena, città alla quale sono molto legato, si sta in casa ma si canta insieme come se si fosse per la strada. Mi sono commosso  pic.twitter.com/IDPqNEj3h3
