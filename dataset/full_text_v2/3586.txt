  Hawaii hare reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus.
  The patient was on the  Grand Princess cruise ship , now docked off the coast of San Francisco, Gov. David Ige said at news conference. The traveler disembarked last month in Mexico and flew home to Honolulu, officials said.
  The ship made four stops in Hawaii in February and carried at least four passengers from Hawaii. State officials want anyone who was on the ship to "self-quarantine."
  Last month officials said  a couple from Japan was diagnosed with the virus  after visiting Hawaii. But state officials have  not officially counted the cases  as originating in the Aloha State, and the exact source of the pair's exposure remained a mystery.
