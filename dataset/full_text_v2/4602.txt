  More than 1.5 million Hong Kongers have signed up to receive free reusable masks as the semi-autonomous city continues its coronavirus containment efforts. 
  The new mask, which can be washed up to 60 times, will be distributed free to all citizens of Hong Kong who have a valid address.
  The office of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam said more than 1.5 million people had registered for the mask on Wednesday.  
  Hong Kong has been effective in containing the outbreak with only four deaths and 1,040 infections so far.
