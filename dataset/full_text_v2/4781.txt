  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday that an additional 402 people have died from the coronavirus, a record single-day high. Meanwhile, fatalities in neighboring New York continued to drop. 
  The total number of deaths for New Jersey is now 6,442 with 113,856 positive cases, Murphy announced at a press conference on Tuesday. 
  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at his news conference that 335 residents have lost their lives to the virus, bringing the state's confirmed virus deaths to 17,638.
  Last Wednesday, Cuomo reported 438 deaths. In the days since that number has continued to drop. On Monday, there were 337 deaths. 
  "Every day, I think maybe today is the day that the nightmare will be over — but maybe not," Cuomo said. 
  While we’re seeing progress in some key metrics, there is one number which always gives us pause. Sadly, we must report 402 additional deaths. We’ve now lost a total of 6,442 members of our New Jersey family to  #COVID19  related complications.  pic.twitter.com/F7Zvx6NNoD
