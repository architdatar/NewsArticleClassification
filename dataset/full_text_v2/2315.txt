  Violence erupted in Mombasa, Kenya, on Friday after police dispersed large crowds in the city two hours before the country's early curfew time, which was set in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
  Social media footage verified by NBC News shows police throwing tear gas canisters into the crowd, causing a stampede. Men appearing to wear Kenyan Police uniforms are also seen in the videos beating people on the streets.
  Amnesty International and 20 other advocacy groups condemned the violence, calling the incident an "unnecessary and excessive use of force."
  The Kenyan Ministry of Health reported 59 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday.
