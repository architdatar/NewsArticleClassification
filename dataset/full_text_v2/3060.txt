  Customs officers at Los Angeles International Airport this week seized a package they believe contained fake coronavirus testing kits, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Saturday.
  The seizure took place Thursday when officers examining a parcel with the words "purified water vials" found items inside labeled "Corona Virus 2019nconv (COVID-19)" and "Virus1 Test Kit," CBP spokesmanÂ Jaime Ruiz said in a statement.
  "The shipment was turned over to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for analysis," he said
  The package was from the United Kingdom. CBP officials warned Americans to be wary of "bogus" home testing kits found online.
