  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that when people can safely gather again, the city will throw the "biggest and best" ticker tape parade to thank health care workers, first responders and everyone who has helped in the fight against the coronavirus. 
  "This parade will mark the beginning of our renaissance and will, most importantly, be a chance to say thank you to so many good and noble people," de Blasio said. 
  "I think this will be the greatest of all the parades because this one will speak to the rebirth of New York City" and to the "heroism that is intrinsic to New Yorkers," the mayor said.
  The parade will run down the "Canyon of Heroes," on Broadway from the Battery to City Hall, he said. "And that will be a beautiful and joyous day in our city." 
  On Monday, de Blasio announced that the city's  Celebrate Israel, Puerto Rican Day and LGBTQ pride parades would be canceled  due to the pandemic.
