  Armenia's Prime Minister has returned to work after being diagnosed with coronavirus, his press officer has told CNN.  Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan started working from home early last week  "The Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, his spouse, Anna Hakobyan, and three of their children have been tested negative for the coronavirus in a double testing. The PM will be back on his full duties starting from today," Mane Gevorgyan, the Prime Minister's press officer, said in a text message. Pashinyan is one of several senior politicians to be diagnosed with the virus. UK Prime Minister  Boris Johnson  spent time in intensive care suffering from Covid-19, while Kentucky senator  Rand Paul  tested positive for the virus in March. Iran's Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar and Deputy Health Minister  Iraj Harirchi  both tested positive for the virus, and an adviser to the country's  Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  died after contracting it. Justin Trudeau's wife Sophie was also  diagnosed  with the virus, forcing the Canadian Prime Minister to isolate for two weeks. Britain's  Prince Charles  and Monaco's  Prince Albert  also contracted Covid-19.

  6:57 a.m. ET, June 8, 2020 Top health officials monitor nationwide protests, fearing coronavirus may spread From CNN's Christina Maxouris A crowd of protesters walk from the Capitol building to the White House during a protest against police brutality and racism, on June 6, in Washington, DC.

  Health officials have raised concern about the spread of coronavirus, as thousands of people  brave the pandemic to participate in national protests sparked by the death  of George Floyd.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Sunday it was closely monitoring demonstrations taking place across the US, and warned that such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases. For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said that without the lockdowns  most states put in place, the death toll could have been significantly higher.  As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out, and always maintain a distance.  But  large protests make it hard to keep to the recommended social distancing  guidelines and "may put others at risk," CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement. "It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal Covid-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground," she said. 
  Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus. "I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event," he said -- especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission. Read the full story here:

  Directors and executives of around 480 listed companies can apply for exemption from the 14-day compulsory quarantine when arriving in Hong Kong from mainland China, according to a government statement issued on Monday morning.  Companies can start to apply for the exemption from Monday. Companies that are listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and included in the Hang Seng Index, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index or Hang Seng Composite LargeCap, MidCap or SmallCap Index, can nominate a maximum of two persons each for the exemption.  But visits must be for performing duties related to the essential operation of the companies, such as board meetings, business review meetings or meetings with clients, or executing legal documents, the statement said.  Directors and executives will also be subject to 14-day medical surveillance upon arrival, which requires them to wear masks, check their body temperature daily, and report any symptoms or health concerns to the Hong Kong health department.

  9:14 a.m. ET, June 8, 2020 China's economy is still struggling to recover from the pandemic From CNN's Laura He China is trying to dig itself out of a steep economic slump. But as the rest of the world still battles with the  coronavirus pandemic , the path to recovery is looking slow and painful.  Exports in the world's second largest economy last month dropped 3.3% in US dollar terms compared to a year ago, customs data released this weekend showed, reversing a 3.5% rise in April. Analysts attributed the downturn to weak demand abroad:  While China began reopening its economy months ago, many other global powers have only begun to lift some lockdown measures in the past few weeks. The recovery at home hasn't been entirely smooth for China either. Imports last month plunged 16.7% in US dollar terms from a year ago — the deepest contraction since January 2016 — suggesting domestic demand remains sluggish. Read the full story here:

  China's Foreign Ministry has called on US Senator Rick Scott to "produce the evidence" after he accused China of trying to "sabotage" US vaccine efforts. "The Senator claims there is evidence showing China is sabotaging and slowing down Western countries' [vaccine] efforts, I hope he will just produce the evidence," said Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday.  "The US has been slandering and smearing China for a long time, we have all gotten sick and tired of that," added Hua. 
  Hua said research and development for a coronavirus vaccine is not "a race between China and the US but between humans and the virus." She added that if China successfully develops a vaccine it will be made a "global public good." Hua's comments come after Scott told the BBC during an interview: "We have got to get this vaccine done. Unfortunately, we have evidence that communist China is trying to sabotage us or slow it down."

  New Zealand is lifting almost all restrictions now that it no longer has any active cases of Covid-19 -- but its international borders will remain shut to non-residents to prevent new outbreaks.  That is, unless they receive special permission. Some overseas visitors and businesspeople will be allowed to enter the country and work there if they can demonstrate that they will provide a benefit to the New Zealand economy. Acclaimed film director James Cameron is one of those. He and his crew have been given permission by the New Zealand government to work inside the country on "Avatar 2," CNN learned today. The first "Avatar" movie is the highest-grossing film in history, bringing in roughly $2.8 billion at the worldwide box office in 2009. The release date for "Avatar 2" has been bumped from December 18, 2020 to December, 17, 2021.
