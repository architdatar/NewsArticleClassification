National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told CNN that when the world eventually gets a coronavirus vaccine, it might require two doses to be fully effective.
  “Obviously that’s not our favorite. It would be much better if this could all be done with a single injection,” Collins said.
  Generally, with any vaccine, one dose is preferred for cost reasons, and also because people are less likely to show up twice to receive an injection.
  Collins said the large-scale clinical trials of several experimental vaccines, expected to start next month, will reveal whether one or two doses will be necessary. 
  The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, is currently funding research on five different experimental vaccines. Pharmaceutical companies Moderna and AstraZeneca are currently in clinical trials, testing the vaccines on humans. Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, and Merck are developing a vaccine, but have not yet started clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization.
  
  
  Washington, DC, has seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases that occurred on May 30 due to a backlog in testing results.
  Officials now anticipate a possible new peak in cases.

  Sweden will ease its travel restrictions stating June 13 to allow those who do not have any symptoms of coronavirus to move around the country, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said on Thursday, his spokesperson told CNN. 
  "This decision does not mean that the danger is over," Lofven said during a news conference. "It doesn't mean that life is back to normal again, and other restrictions remain in place."
  "If the curve showing the seriously ill turns up again, there will be new restrictions." 
  Starting June 8, seasonal workers in agricultural, forestry and horticulture from the European Union will be allowed in Sweden.

  The Jordanian government announced further steps to reopen the country as the kingdom decreased its coronavirus risk level to “moderate,” Prime Minister Omar Razzaz said in a televised briefing on Thursday, adding that less than ten cases a day were recorded over the past week.
  These are the new guidelines:  
  Some background:  Jordan moved early by implementing one of the strictest lockdown measures in the Middle East after recording its first coronavirus case in March.
  The country has since recorded some of the lowest case numbers in the region with 765 cases and nine deaths, according to the country's Health Ministry figures.
  The kingdom began easing restrictions in May and last week announced it will allow the opening of mosques and churches for worship, according to Jordanian religious leaders.
  Jordan remains under defense Law, an emergency law that gives the government sweeping powers.
  
  
  Protesters need to be evaluated and tested for coronavirus, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Thursday.
  “We really want those individuals to highly consider being evaluated and get tested,” Redfield said at a House Appropriations hearing on the Covid-19 response.
  “I do think there is a potential, unfortunately for this to be a seeding event,” he said — especially those in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.
  During an exchange with Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Redfield addressed the use of tear gas on protesters. Redfield said in his experience tear gas can cause people to cough – not a good thing during a pandemic involving a respiratory virus. 
  Pocan asked Redfield if he had advised the President or worked with law enforcement to discontinue to use of tear gas during the pandemic.  
  “I think you raised an important point we have advocated strongly — the ability to have face coverings and masks available to protesters, so that they can at least have those coverings,” Redfield said. 
  Redfield added he would “pass on this comment to next Task Force meeting.”  
  
  
  Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), shook his head when shown a photo of a crowd at the Lake of Ozarks, Missouri that was taken over Memorial Day weekend.
  States are opening before they have met the criteria laid out by the White House for safe lifting of pandemic restrictions, he said.
  “We continue to try to figure out how to penetrate the message with different groups, [and] the pictures that the chairwoman showed me are great examples of serious problems,” the CDC director said.
  White House guidance says that all states must have the ability to trace contacts for confirmed Covid-19 cases. But Missouri does not have the ability to do this tracing, House Appropriations committee chair Rosa DeLauro said.
  National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell sent a league-wide memo stating that NFL coaches can return to training facilities starting Friday.
  CNN acquired the memo from a source with direct involvement with the NFL.
  Goodell clarified the directive in part, "...this may occur only if your club has otherwise received necessary permission from state and local governments to reopen its facilities.” 
  Also, teams may increase the number of employees in each facility up to 100 as long as they follow the "state and local regulation and implementation of the protocols developed under the leadership of Dr. Sills."
  Dr. Allen Sills is the NFL's Chief Medical Officer. 
  The Global Vaccine Summit hosted by the UK government has raised $8.8 billion for vaccine research over the next five years, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Thursday.
  The event, which aimed to raise at least $7.4 billion for vaccine research, surpassed its goal by more than one billion dollars.
