  Three Georgia inmates have tested positive for coronavirus, officials announced Friday.
  The three, housed at Lee State Prison in Leesburg, were hospitalized Sunday and Monday after exhibiting flu-like symptoms, the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement.
  Three other prisoners at the facility had similar symptoms and were "under observation," the department said.
  "Measures have been taken to screen and quarantine the entire inmate population at that facility," it said.
  On Thursday U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, D-Calif., called on federal prisons to release low-risk offenders so that facilities don't become hot spots for the virus, which spreads by person-to-person contact.
  The sheriff of Los Angeles County on Monday said he wasÂ  granting early release  to those with less than 30 days on their sentences.
