  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, says he is no longer meeting with President Donald Trump nearly as frequently he was before, even as the pandemic drags on.
  "We used to have task force meetings every single day, including Saturday and Sunday, and about 75 percent of the time after the task force meeting, we’d meet with the president," Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told  STAT News  in a wide-ranging interview.
  "But as you probably noticed, that the task force meetings have not occurred as often lately. And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased," Fauci said.
  Fauci's comments come nearly a month after the White House indicated it was  winding down  Trump's coronavirus task force, prompting backlash. A day later, Trump  reversed course and announced  the task force would continue "indefinitely."
  But the group has not held press briefings for several weeks. The task force had been holding press briefings almost every day until  late April , when Trump made a widely condemned suggestion that injecting disinfectants into people could help them recover from the coronavirus.
