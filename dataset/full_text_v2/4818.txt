  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday that testing for the coronavirus in the city had become easier by eliminating the need for a health care worker to administer the test. 
  Previously, a health care worker would have to dress in full protective equipment to test someone, since swabbing of a patient's nose often caused that person to sneeze or cough. The new tests include a less intrusive nasal swab and saliva sample — both of which the patient can do themselves. 
  The new tests are safer and easier, and will allow the city to test more people faster, de Blasio and health professionals said.
  De Blasio also announced Monday that the city will hire some 1,000 health care workers to act as  contact tracers .
