  While California faces multiple crises, there are encouraging signs in the coronavirus fight.
  Infection rates are falling enough that Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that soon he will announce plans for reopening businesses that closed nearly two months ago when cases spiked.
  Newsom called it a “very difficult period, where we’re battling this pandemic as we’re battling these wildfires all up and down the state of California.”
  More than 100,000 people are tested for COVID-19 every day, though the wildfires have made it more difficult in some places, the Democratic governor said. Over the past week, the infection rate for those tested fell to 5.6%, a significant drop from a few weeks ago and well below the state’s target of 8%.
  Hospitalizations are down 20% over a two-week period, Newsom said. There are 4,467 hospitalized with the virus, the lowest figure in two months.
  Isabella County, home to Central Michigan University, has  declared a health emergency  as COVID-19 cases continue to grow after large parties by students.
  “We have seen a large increase in cases since students returned to the Mt. Pleasant area. Our investigations have shown that the majority of these cases had attended large social gatherings,” said Steve Hall, health officer for the Central Michigan District Health Department, in a statement.
  County data shows that in the third week of August there was a 350% increase in the number of COVID-19 cases compared with the previous week, when students were moving in. Central Michigan is running face-to-face classes.
  During that third week, 92% of reported cases were among those aged 18 to 24, the health department said in a statement. In the first two weeks of August, only 39% of cases were in the college student age range.

  Fried chicken chain KFC is  suspending use of its longtime slogan,  "It's Finger Lickin' Good," due to the pandemic, it said Monday.
  The slogan has been used in its advertising for 64 years. Officials said given the pandemic, use of the slogan doesn't feel right at the moment.
  "We find ourselves in a unique situation, having an iconic slogan that doesn’t quite fit in the current environment," said Catherine Tan-Gillespie, global chief marketing officer at KFC, in a statement. "While we are pausing the use of It’s Finger Lickin’ Good, rest assured the food craved by so many people around the world isn’t changing one bit.”

  In a video on the Facebook page  for Chick-fil-A in Carraway Village in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, you can see Ellies go into action.
  She is seen trotting to the restaurant's curbside pickup spot and take the handle of the carryout order in its mouth. Ellie then turns around and takes the order to her owner, whose name is Nick, according to the Facebook post. 
  Nick then waves to the Chick-fil-A team member and they depart. So far, Ellie has retrieved 2.3 million page views.

  A judge  has ruled  that Florida's schools reopening order is unconstitutional. 
  Circuit Judge Charles Dodson on Monday granted a request for a court order to bar enforcement of the directive from Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran that would have reopened schools despite the coronavirus pandemic.  
  Dodson wrote in his decision that the Florida Education Association established that irreparable harm would be caused if schools were to reopen on a date set by state officials. 
  Schools should “reopen when the local decision-makers determine” it isto do so upon advice of medical experts without the threat of a financial penalty from the state affecting the decision, he wrote.

  The  Republican National Convention  has begun in a setting that planners believe will keep delegates and officials safe from the coronavirus -- if they follow the rules.
  Only 336 delegates, a far cry from the thousands that would have come, are in the Charlotte Convention Center for the week-long event.
  Safety measures were guided by a 42-page health and safety plan developed by a hired doctor.
  Attendees are supposed to six-foot social distancing and wear masks – though many were seen openly flouting those rules Monday morning.
  They filled out a pre-travel health questionnaire and participate in a daily symptom tracker. . The Republican National Committee has also committed to contacting every participant five, 14 and 21 days after the event to check on potential symptoms.
  In remarks to the delegates, Trump panned the state’s Democratic governor for restrictions put in place to try to prevent the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 175,000 people in the country and infected millions. Trump accused Gov. Roy Cooper of “being in a total shutdown mode,” and claimed the restrictions were aimed at trying to hurt his campaign.
  Eleven students  were suspended  by Montclair State University in New Jersey for COVID-19 rule violations, according to communications sent to staff and students. 
  A text message reading "Is the Next Message You Want to Get: Pack Your Bags and Go Home?" was sent to students this weekend. It said students had "gathered in large groups to party without masks and social distancing.  
  "Please understand, there will be no second chances," the text read. "Any student who violates the safety protocols will be immediately suspended from housing (possibly for the remainder of the year), will be referred to the Director of Student Conduct for disciplinary action and will be immediately de-registered from any courses or programs that have an on-campus component."
  It also warned there won't be any refunds. 
  According to spokesman Andrew Mees the university is one the few in the state to bring students not only back onto campus, but into the dorms.

  New York will set up COVID-19 testing sites  for incoming passengers at its two largest airports as part of the latest effort to stop travelers from bringing the coronavirus to the state.
  Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday the sites slated for John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in Queens, saying it will allow the state to more quickly determine whether incoming travelers have the virus at the center of a global pandemic.
  New York was the hardest-hit state in the early days of the pandemic, with more than 24,000 state residents succumbing to confirmed COVID-19 cases since the beginning of March.

  Fifteen of the NFL’s 32 teams have so far ruled out spectators to start the season, but the Miami Dolphins won't be one of them.
  The Dolphins are  one of at least eight teams  hoping to have a limited number of spectators, allowing up to 13,000 socially distancing fans to attend their home opener against the Buffalo Bills on Sept. 20.
  The same plan will be followed for the University of Miami’s home opener against UAB at the Dolphins’ stadium on Sept. 10.
  Crowd size will be about 20% of the stadium’s 65,326-seat capacity, with the limitation imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Groups of spectators will be spaced 6 feet apart.
  The first substantiated case of coronavirus reinfection was reported Monday by researchers at the University of Hong Kong, who say a 33-year-old man was infected by SARS-CoV-2 in late March and then was infected again by a different strain of the virus four and half months later while traveling in Europe.
  While the case study suggests coronavirus reinfection is possible, experts have said more data is needed to determine if this is a more rare or common occurrence. However, it does underscore the importance of a vaccine instead of relying on herd immunity through mass infection.
  “Since reinfection can occur, herd immunity by natural infection is unlikely to eliminate #SARSCoV2,” tweeted Akiko Iwasaki,  a professor of immunobiology at Yale University.  “The only safe and effective way to achieve herd immunity is through vaccination.”
  Iwasaki also points out that while the man didn’t have enough antibodies to prevent reinfection, other elements of his immune system were able to defend against illness as he was asymptomatic.
  From another expert: This is good news

  The World Health Organization announced that 172 countries are looking to participate in COVAX, a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide equitable access to safe vaccines once licensed and approved.
  The global vaccine plan includes nine candidate vaccines, with an additional nine under evaluation.
  The news comes as countries that had gone weeks without community transmission are seeing clustered outbreaks. 
  South Korea reported its 11th straight day of triple-digit daily jumps, forcing the country to ban larger gatherings, shut down nightspots and churches and removed fans from professional sports nationwide.
  New Zealand’s prime minister says the two-week lockdown of the country’s largest city, Auckland, will last an extra four days as authorities try to stamp out an outbreak that appeared after 102 days without any community transmission of the virus.
  With the onset of the coronavirus, states and organizations are working on a plan to shelter people displaced during the summer wildfire and hurricane season. 
  Rather than eating and sleeping in large, open rooms, many of those displaced by the the wildfires are being sent to nearby hotels, said Nicole Maul, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, which operates numerous shelters up and down California in areas hit by wildfires.
  The agency continues to use congregate centers, but accepts less evacuees to increase social distancing. They also cannot accept dropped-off donations and serve meals in individual packages instead of buffet style. 
  Depending on expected landfall of Tropical Storms Marco and Laura,  The Louisiana Department of Health  tweeted Monday that COVID-19 testing will be paused through Tuesday, and may be extended through Wednesday,  according to their tweet .
  Gov. John Bel Edwards said the state plans to activate large shelters with congregate settings only "as a last resort," and instead work with the federal government to use hotels and motels if large evacuations become necessary.

  The World Health Organization says using plasma from the recovered to treat COVID-19 is still considered an “experimental” therapy and that the preliminary results showing it may work are still “inconclusive.”
  WHO’s chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said the treatment is difficult to standardize since people produce different levels of antibodies and the plasma must be collected individually from recovered patients.
  Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO’s director-general, warned of numerous possible side effects, from a mild fever and chills to more severe lung-related injuries. U.S. infectious disease experts echo WHO's caution. 
  Trump called a news conference Sunday to announce his administration has  granted emergency use authorization for treatment using blood plasma , though more than 70,000 patients have already received it on an experimental basis
  "This is a powerful therapy," Trump said, describing the authorization as "a very historic breakthrough."

  The Iowa Department of Public Health reported the state's first child death from COVID-19 on Sunday. The 5-year-old child died in June and had "significant underlying health conditions," officials announced in a news release.
  The department said the state's medical examiner completed its investigation on August 6. Officials performed a number of tests that take months to complete but found that COVID-19 was the cause of the child's death.
  The announcement comes one day before some schools prepare to start the new year on Monday. Gov. Kim Reynolds ordered schools to reopen for at least 50 percent in-person instruction, despite a pandemic that has already killed 1,036 people and seen infections soar in recent days.
  The NFL had 77 positive COVID-19 tests from 11 teams re-examined by a New Jersey lab after false positives,  and all those tests came back negative. 
  The league asked the New Jersey lab BioReference to investigate the results, and those 77 tests are being re-tested once more to make sure they were false positives.
  Among teams reporting false positives, the Minnesota Vikings said they had 12, the New York Jets 10 and the Chicago Bears nine. Other teams may also include the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions and the Cleveland Browns. 
  The number of positive COVID-19 tests from a specific facility that might actually be false demonstrates the precarious position the NFL is in less than three weeks from the regular-season opener.
  Anyone testing positive for COVID-19 — even a false positive upon a retest — is required to have two more negative tests before being cleared to return. 
  Thirteen people  died in a stampede  at a disco in Peru after a police raid to enforce the country’s lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic, officials said Sunday. The stampede happened at the Thomas disco in Lima, where about 120 people had gathered for a party on Saturday night, the Interior Ministry said.
  People tried to escape through the only door of the second-floor disco, trampling one another and becoming trapped in the confined space, according to authorities. After the stampede, police had to force open the door.
  “I feel sorry for the relatives... but also anger and indignation with the business people who organized the event,” Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra said at a public event in the south of the country. He urged judicial authorities to punish those who had broken the law.
  Some 23 people were arrested, and 15 of those tested positive for the new coronavirus and will be quarantined, Claudio Ramírez, a Health Ministry official, told reporters.
  Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden  has not been tested  for the coronavirus though he is confident he could not have been infected, his campaign said Sunday. 
  "He has not been tested," Kate Bedingfield, deputy Biden campaign manager, said on ABC News "This Week." She added that  "moving forward should he need to be tested, he certainly would be. But he has not been tested yet." 
  Bedingfield said Biden, 77, has followed the "strictest protocols" to prevent exposure to the virus and was therefore confident he had not been infected. She said everyone is around Biden "is undergoing the appropriate testing." 
  "He has not had the virus," she said.
