  President Donald Trump, during Tuesday's press briefing, reiterated a claim he's made for weeks about the U.S. and testing for coronavirus.
  “And we have tested more people than anybody anywhere in the world by far. By very far,” Trump said at the White House. 
  Later, he reiterated the point: “Again, I’ll say it for the fifth time: We have tested more than any country in the world, and some of the countries are very big, ok? More than any country in the world."
  We’ve  fact checked this statement repeatedly . It's still true that the U.S. has run the highest number of raw tests, but not the most per capita. Italy has run 1.45 million tests in a country with 60 million people. That’s one test for every 41 Italians. The U.S., with an estimated population of 328 million people, has run 4.1 million tests  — one test for every 80 people, approximately.
  The U.S. has caught up to some other countries; we'd  previously  used South Korea as an example of a country testing at a higher rate per capita, but as of April 21, they'd run approximately one test for every 89 citizens.
