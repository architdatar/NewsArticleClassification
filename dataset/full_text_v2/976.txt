  Four unidentified Brooklyn Nets players have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a press release Tuesday. 
  Only one of the four NBA players is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, the disease associated with coronavirus, and all four are under the care of team doctors, the Nets said. All players and traveling staff are isolating themselves while staying in contact with medical staff. 
  "The health of our players and staff is of the highest priority to the organization and the team is doing everything within its power to ensure that those affected receive the best care possible," the team said. 
  The NBA season was suspended Wednesday after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive.
