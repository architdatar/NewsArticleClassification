  Convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein was moved out of medical isolation in prison, a spokesperson confirmed on Thursday, just over two weeks after  he tested positive for coronavirus . 
  The former movie mogul has been "deemed alright," according to his publicist Juda Engelamyer. Weinstein tested positive at the maximum security  Wende Correctional Facility  near Buffalo, New York, Michael Powers, president of the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association told NBC News in March.
  Several staffers at the facility who had contact with Weinstein had also been placed in quarantine. 
  Weinstein is currently serving 23 years in prison after he was found guilty of third-degree rape and first degree criminal sexual act last month.
