  More than 470 New York state residents were reported dead from COVID-19 in the past day, officials said Wednesday, bringing the state's death toll beyond 15,000. 
  Of the 474 confirmed fatalities in the past 24 hours, 446 were at hospitals and 28 at nursing homes,  Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at his daily briefing on coronavirus.
  The confirmed death toll in New York state now stands at 15,302. That total does not included  presumptive deaths.
   "At least it isn’t going up anymore and it seems to be on a gentle decline," Cuomo said.
