  As many as  240,000 Americans may die from the new coronavirus  according to estimates released by the White House, a grim prediction that influenced President Donald Trump's decision to extend social distancing guidelines. If Americans continue to hunker down, the number of projected deaths falls to between 100,000 and 240,000.  So let’s stay home and do our part.  The president also warned the nation to  brace for a painful next two weeks . "This is going to be one of the roughest two or three weeks we've ever had in our country," the president said during a dark press conference on Tuesday. "Our country is in the midst of a great national trial."  
  Welcome to the quarantine party, Florida  
  Florida, among the states with the highest coronavirus cases,  has finally issued a statewide stay-at-home order . Starting Friday, Floridians will only be able to leave their homes for essential services or activities. More than 30 states have stay-at-home orders in place. Altogether, more than 250 million Americans – about 75% of the country – have been told to remain sheltered. 
  To wear or not to wear those face masks 😷 
  Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. government has said masks were not needed for the general public.  That guidance could soon change . Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Wednesday that the CDC will review its guidance discouraging the general public from wearing masks.  But listen up, friends : "Even if you do wear a mask, it can't be at the expense of social distancing," Adams said.

  Coronavirus for kids without internet 
  Half of all Americans lack high-speed internet. So schools are quarantining worksheets or  letting kids do homework in the parking lot  as governments mandate distance learning.
  Give it to me straight  
  More than 213,000 people in the U.S. have tested positive for the coronavirus as of Wednesday,  doubling the number of cases from just five days ago . Worldwide, there are more than 46,400 deaths and over 921,000 confirmed cases.
  The most powerful earthquake to strike Idaho since 1983 slammed the state on Tuesday evening,  a magnitude 6.5 temblor that even jolted people across three neighboring states . The quake was centered 73 miles northeast of Meridian, near Boise, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and for some, conjured up memories of the state's worst such natural disaster, the 6.9 magnitude Borah Peak earthquake nearly four decades ago that killed two people and resulted in millions in damages, according to the Idaho Geological Survey. 
  Trump  issued another threat to Iran on Wednesday , saying he would retaliate if the Tehran government struck again at U.S. interests in Iraq. "Upon information and belief, Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq," Trump tweeted. "If this happens, Iran will pay a very heavy price, indeed!" Relations between the U.S. and Iran have been tense for decades, but especially in recent months. In early January, Trump authorized a  drone strike that killed a high-ranking Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani .
  By now you've probably been bombarded by ads  urging you to participate in the 2020 Census . Well, now it’s my turn: Fill it out! Tom Hanks wants you to be counted, too. “These few minutes will make a difference and impact our democracy for years to come,” says Hanks. The actor recently  recovered from coronavirus  and is  still  urging us to participate. It's the least we can do for good ole Tom, right? Right. 
  What is the census, anyway?  It’s is a national count of people living in the country, done every 10 years. 
  Why should you care?  Much is at stake for local communities. The Census count is used to distribute more than $860 billion in federal funds for schools, roads, bridges and lunch programs. It’s also used to determine the number of House seats a state has in Congress. 
  OK, I’m in. How do I fill it out?  Take five minutes to do it  right here online .

  I’m a nurse who has immunity issues preventing me from being in the trenches with my fellow nurses. I’m proud that I can still help by triaging patients with mild symptoms as well as those showing symptoms for COVID-19 who need to see a virtual care provider and patients with chronic health conditions. Patients have been so appreciative. It’s been an honor to serve my community this way. Then, I think about my fellow nurses working in an unprepared war zone. We didn’t train for this ever! I am proud to work in this time in history – one that we will look back on and say we came together as one to help all.
  – Tammy SanGiacomo, nurse manager in Cary, North Carolina
