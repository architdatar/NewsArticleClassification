  The head of the United Nations  António Guterres  warned on Tuesday that the  coronavirus  pandemic is the "greatest test that we have faced together since the formation of the United Nations.”
  The U.N. Secretary-General called for "global solidarity," underscoring that developed countries must help less developed ones bear the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 or “face the nightmare of the disease spreading like wildfire in the global South." 
  “Let us remember that we are only as strong as the weakest health system in our interconnected world”, he said, launching a  report  on Tuesday. The U.N. was "fully mobilized" to support countries with issues from unemployment, debt alleviation to health systems, he added.
