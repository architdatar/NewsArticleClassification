  5:17 p.m. ET, July 8, 2020 White House says Trump and CDC are "very much" on the same page, despite tweets From CNN's Allie Malloy  White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Win McNamee/Getty Images 
  White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that President Trump and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are “very much” on the same page — despite Trump tweeting: “I disagree with the CDC.” “I would note that the CDC is very much on the same page as the President — which is why you heard the CDC director today underscore these are not prescriptive, these are not requirements and that there will be supplemental guidelines. So they’re on the same page,” McEnany said Wednesday. Trump  tweeted  seven hours earlier: “I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open, they are asking school to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!” Collins also asked McEnany why the President won’t attend task force meetings so he can talk about guidelines and other issues. "(Trump) is routinely briefed about the coronavirus each and every day that relevant information is brought to him on the big decisions and then he moves forward in the way that’s best for our country," McEnany responded. CNN has reported that Trump has not attended a coronavirus task force meeting since April.

  5:07 p.m. ET, July 8, 2020 Los Angeles health director hopes schools can reopen in August From CNN's Cheri Mossburg Los Angeles County expects to issue guidance on reopening schools within the week, according to Health Director Barbara Ferrer. Ferrer said she remains hopeful that cases stabilize by the end of July so districts can resume classes in mid-August. “I’ll leave the politics around this to other people,” Ferrer said, adding that her focus is on protecting the health and safety of people in Los Angeles.  
  The county plans on reopening schools once the data shows it is safe to do so, she said. “We would never open any other sectors without looking at our data. You absolutely would not want to open a sector when you thought that the result of reopening would be an explosion of outbreaks within that sector,” Ferrer said.

  Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo announced 41 new cases and two deaths related to Covid-19 Wednesday while denouncing  President Trump's remarks  about reopening schools.  Asked about Trump’s comments threatening to fine states that don’t reopen schools, Raimondo said, "I just, I think it’s irresponsible, dishonest and reckless." The governor said $50 million has been allocated to assist school districts in taking necessary precautions due to Covid-19.  "Having said that, I want to get kids back to school in Rhode Island," the governor added.  
  About the state's reopening : Rhode Island beaches were crowded over the July 4 holiday, but no beach parking lots were ever at capacity, according to Raimondo. State officials handed out masks at beach entry points and asked beachgoers to disperse in the event of large groups congregating, she said. As food and drink establishments have reopened in Rhode Island, state officials have found 10% are not in compliance with social distancing advisories and allow too much crowding.

  4:29 p.m. ET, July 8, 2020 California governor says schools will reopen when the data shows it is safe to do so From CNN's Cheri Mossburg and Stella Chan Schools grounds stand empty at the Miguel Contreras Learning Complex before the new restrictions went into effect at midnight as the the coronavirus pandemic spreads on March 19, in Los Angeles, California.  David McNew/Getty Images 
  California schools will reopen when the data shows it is safe to do so, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom  “I’m not worried about the latest tweets,” he said, in a thinly veiled reference to President Trump.  “We need to address safely reopening schools. That to me is non-negotiable," the governor said at a news conference. Reopening schools will be based on local conditions in the state, but Newsom added that “we must insist upon learning at the beginning of the school year.” “Given our current data and the ongoing community transmission of this deadly virus, it’s prudent that school districts prepare a distance learning back-up plan that is ready to be implemented in the event that our data shows us this is the safest path forward,” the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement to CNN. Anticipating that schools will continue to be a topic of conversation, Newsom implored the public that reopening is contingent on behavior. “We can just roll over and accept the spread and transmission with behaviors that have led to this,” Newsom said. “Or we can do more to practice personal responsibilities with face coverings and masks and physical distancing that will mitigate the spread.”

  4:32 p.m. ET, July 8, 2020 Here's the latest coronavirus update from Louisiana From CNN's Pierre Meilhan The number of people contracting Covid-19 in Louisiana are getting younger and more White people, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Wednesday. There’s a smaller percentage of younger patients in intensive care unit beds and on ventilators, Edwards told reporters in Baton Rouge. The total number of Covid-19 cases in Louisiana is 70,151, according to the state’s Department of Health. “People in Louisiana have a role to play,” he said. "It’s important (to wear masks) any time outside your home.” The governor said the state's goal is to open up schools on time but it needs to be done safely. If on-campus learning resumes, Edwards said it won’t look like the way it did before the coronavirus pandemic.
