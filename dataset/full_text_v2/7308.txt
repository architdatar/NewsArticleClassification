  "I have directed @SecretarySonny to expedite help to our farmers, especially to the smaller farmers who are hurting right now," Trump tweeted Thursday evening. "I expect Secretary Purdue to use all of the funds and authorities at his disposal to make sure that our food supply is stable, strong, and safe...."
  It wasn't immediately clear how much money was at Perdue's disposal. On March 27,Â  the president signed a $2 trillion relief package  that includes $1,200 payments for payroll workers and some gig workers and even more for families.
  The agriculture secretary responded to Trump minutes later on  Twitter : "At the direction of @RealDonaldTrump, @USDA is using all financial resources we have been given to develop a program that will include direct payments to farmers & ranchers hurt by COVID-19 & other procurement methods to help solidify the supply chain from producers to consumers."
