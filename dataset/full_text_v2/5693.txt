  Russia's President Vladimir Putin said Monday the country might need to call in the army to help with the coronavirus epidemic and warned that the contagion was getting worse there.
  In a meeting with the top coronavirus task force officials Monday afternoon, Putin asked them to consider using the army to help tackle the crisis, noting how it had sent doctors and medical equipment to other countries in recent weeks to help.
  "It is necessary, of course, to use this experience and keep in mind that all capabilities — including those of the Ministry of Defense — can, of course, and should be used here [at home], if necessary," Putin said. 
  Russia's death toll reached 148 on Monday, with the total number of cases now standing at 18,328.
  “We are seeing that the situation is changing almost daily. And, unfortunately, not for the better," Putin said. "The number of sick people is rising, and there are more and more cases taking a severe, serious turn.”
