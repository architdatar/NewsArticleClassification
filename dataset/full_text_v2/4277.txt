Thousands lined up in sweltering heat Monday outside Houston's Fountain of Praise Church to pay respects to George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis two weeks ago. Floyd will be laid to rest in Houston Tuesday. 
  Meanwhile  Derek Chauvin , the since-fired police officer who pinned Floyd down with his knee on Floyd's neck, leading to his death, appeared in court via video link from jail, where his bail was set at $1.25 million. Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter.
  Across the country, the case is raising questions about the use of excessive force by police. Democrats unveiled a sweeping bill aimed at  reforming law enforcement , but in Minneapolis and elsewhere, there have been calls to defund police departments.
