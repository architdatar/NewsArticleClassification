  The world’s oldest man has been forced to cancel his 112th birthday celebrations due to the virus outbreak.
  From Hampshire, England, Bob Weighton was meant to celebrate his birthday this Sunday.
  Weighton, who also lived through the Spanish flu pandemic which swept around the globe in 1918 when he was 10 years old, said his celebrations are a “dead loss”.
  “Everything is cancelled, no visitors, no celebration," he  told Sky News  on Saturday.
