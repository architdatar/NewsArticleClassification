  It’s back to his scrubs for Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. The former doctor re-registered as a medical practitioner last month to help the country's healthcare system as it deals with the  coronavirus epidemic , his office said Sunday.
  Varadkar will work for the health service for one session a week “in areas that are within his scope of practice,” a statement from his office said. 
  "He wanted to help out even in a small way," the statement added. According to a report in the Irish Times, Varadkar is helping out with phone assessments of coronavirus patients.
