  1:22 p.m. ET, March 26, 2020 Here's how the final vote on the stimulus bill will play out From Manu Raju and Haley Byrd US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks with reporters during her weekly press conference at the US Capitol on March 26. Alex Edelman/AFP/Getty Images 
  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy both made clear today they want the $2 trillion stimulus bill to be approved by their chamber Friday by voice vote. That would ensure that most House members would not have to return to Washington. But if any member requests a recorded vote, then House members would have to return at a later date to cast a roll call vote. So far, at least two members, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Thomas Massie, have not ruled out requesting a recorded vote. What happens next:  House GOP leaders plan to walk through the stimulus bill with their members on a 1:30 p.m. conference call today, according to a Republican source. House Democratic leaders will have their own caucus call at 3 p.m., according to a Democratic source. These calls will be important to ensure leaders have cooperation from their rank-and-file to allow the bill to pass by voice vote Friday morning — rather than requiring all members to come back to vote in person.  How the vote will happen:  On Friday, the House will convene at 9 a.m. Then there will be time for a debate, equally divided between the two sides. And then they will proceed to a voice vote. Once the presiding officer says the "ayes" have it, the bill will be passed — unless a member requests a recorded vote. It's unclear how many members will show for Friday's debate and voice vote — it can be very few, or it can be a lot, there is no requirement. Also, at his news conference today, McCarthy made clear the House will look different than it usually does in order to promote social distancing. He said the members won't sit next each other, they'll alter where the members stand, and staff will be cleaning as members come and go. He also said that members will have to enter one designated door and leave out the other.

  1:09 p.m. ET, March 26, 2020 Coronavirus pandemic will likely be around "for 12 to 18 months," Harvard doctor says  From CNN Health's Jacqueline Howard The coronavirus pandemic may not go away in just a few weeks or so, Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said during a Facebook Live Q&A on Thursday. "This is not a virus that goes away in two weeks or four weeks or six weeks. We are going to be living with this, in one form or another, for 12 to 18 months if we are lucky," Jha said, referring to how long some health officials have predicted it would take to develop a vaccine.  
  "Once we have a vaccine that’s effective and widely deployed we can bring the pandemic to an end," Jha said. "Until that time, we are going to continue to have to confront and deal with the virus." Scientists around the world have been working on developing vaccines that are effective against the novel coronavirus and there are dozens in development. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general for the World Health Organization, said in February that a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could take 12 to 18 months. Just last week, a vaccine trial in the United States announced that its first patient had received a dose. CNN reported last week that a 100-page federal plan on how to tackle the coronavirus pandemic showed the Trump administration is making contingency plans for a pandemic that could stretch up to "18 months or longer" and could include "multiple waves of illness."

  Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde has  granted pardon  to more than 4,000 prisoners in efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country. Sahle-Work Zewde announced the order in a tweet on Wednesday and said it would help prevent overcrowding in prisons. The directive only covers those given a maximum sentence of three years for minor crimes and those who were about to be released from jail, she said. There are 12 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ethiopia, according to the World Health Organization on Wednesday. Authorities in the nation have put in place a raft of measures including the closure of all borders except to those bringing in essential goods to contain the virus. The government has directed security officials to monitor and enforce a ban on large gatherings and overcrowded public transport to ensure social distancing.

We have been in discussions with the United States on this,” Trudeau said during a news conference outside his Ottawa home where he remains in quarantine.
