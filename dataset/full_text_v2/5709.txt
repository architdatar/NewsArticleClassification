  Anyone setting foot on the  streets of San Francisco,  outside their homes, will be required to wear a face covering, authorities said Friday.
  The order by Mayor London Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax goes into effect tonight.
  Starting today, people in San Francisco are required to wear face coverings at essential businesses, in public facilities, on transit, and while performing essential work. This is not a replacement for staying home and physical distancing, but it is an important step for safety.
  "Additionally, transportation workers and other employees who interact with the public must also cover their face while doing essential work," according to the new city mandate.
   Los Angeles , California's largest city, already has a similar policy in place.
