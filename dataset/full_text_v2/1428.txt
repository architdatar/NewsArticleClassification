  Democratic presidential candidates have critcized President Donald Trump's claim that the  coronavirus  is the Democrats' "new hoax."
  They  called the charge "dangerous" and "disturbing"  — while Trump complained again they are making political hay of the outbreak.
  Trump made the assertion during  a rally in South Carolina  Friday night. He told the crowd Democrats have been "politicizing" the outbreak. 
  Former Vice President Joe Biden told MSNBC earlier Saturday that Trump's rally comments were "absolutely bizarre."
  "Look, this is a serious, serious problem. It's able to be solved, but it requires us to be absolutely level-headed and let the scientists have the lead in all of this," Biden said. "But for him to start talking about it being a hoax is absolutely dangerous. It's just not a decent way to act."
  Echoing his complaint, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told the "TODAY" Saturday that he's "very concerned" with how the administration has handled the issue to date.
