  For truck drivers loading supplies across America, like Douglas Mcconnaughhay in Arksansas, it’s become harder to find a meal with restaurants closed and more worrisome to protect against the coronavirus as it continues to spread.
  His wife shared what he's been going through lately in a now-viral Facebook post made before he headed back out on the road March 22. 
   
  “She was going to take me to my truck. She came in there and took the picture. I didn’t know it until after the fact. I was just back there by myself,” he told NBC News.
  Mcconnaughhay drives 70 hours a week Monday through Friday in a Peterbilt truck. He's among more than 3.5 million truck drivers in the United States, according to the  most recent census data . 
  “There was a lot of stuff that was going through my mind. My main issue is I can’t bring the virus back home to my wife because of her health issues. I just want to be able to be safe and make sure that my home stays healthy and safe,” Mcconnaughhay said.
