  Saudi Arabia has told Muslim pilgrims around the world to hold off on making arrangements to attend the annual Hajj pilgrimage, set to take place in July, while the  coronavirus  pandemic continues to spread.
  "Saudi Arabia cares for the health of all Muslims coming to the Kingdom therefore we have asked Islamic countries not to issue Hajj contracts yet until the situation becomes clear," the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah  tweeted  on Tuesday.
  The annual pilgrimage to Mecca last year attracted about  2.5 million  people from countries around the world.
