  Michigan results  are trickling in as the final polls closed, and results in one large county show a huge swing from 2016 to 2020.
  In Kalamazoo County — home of Western Michigan University and one of the state's 10 largest counties — Sanders is currently up by less than a point over Biden.
  In 2016, when Sanders narrowly won the state, the Vermont senator won that county by nearly 23 points.
  As is, Biden holds a nearly 10 point lead in the state with 32 percent of precincts reporting.
