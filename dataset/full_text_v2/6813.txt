  After a Monday morning press conference in which New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pleaded for the federal government to increasingly help states battle the coronavirus outbreak, President Donald Trump tweeted that he should "do more."
  "Just had a very good tele-conference with Nation’s Governors," Trump  wrote . "Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to "do more."
  Cuomo quickly fired back on Twitter. 
  "I have to do more? No — YOU have to do something! You’re supposed to be the President," he said.
  Trump's remarks came after Cuomo called on the federal government to help build emergency hospital space and to provide states with uniform guidelines for shutdowns, like Cuomo announced Monday for restaurants, bars, gyms, movie theaters and casinos.
