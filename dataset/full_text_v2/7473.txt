  President Donald Trump said Friday that he had not yet been tested for  coronavirus  antibodies but would be taking the  test  in the future.
  “I will do that," Trump said in an interview with "Fox & Friends" about taking the antibody test. "Who knows, some people had it and they didn't even know they had it."
  Antibody tests  provide information about whether a person's immune system has developed antibodies needed to fight off a particular infection. A positive test means a person has antibodies, and therefore had the virus at some point; a negative test means a person does not have antibodies and has not yet contracted the virus. 
  Trump is believed to have been in close contact with multiple people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The White House said Thursday that Trump’s  personal valet , who works in the West Wing serving the president his meals, among other duties, had tested positive for the coronavirus. In March, a  Brazilian official  Trump met with at Mar-a-Lago also tested positive for the virus.
