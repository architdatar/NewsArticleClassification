  MINNEAPOLIS â€” Muslims in south Minneapolis will be able to maintain safe physical distance during the call to prayer throughout the holy month of Ramadan.
  The call to prayer will be broadcast by speaker five times each day to allow neighborhood residents to pray together.
  Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey facilitated the noise permit after the community requested the service. The Council on American-Islamic Relations paid for the audio equipment for the broadcasts from a mosque.
  The broadcasts are expected to reach thousands of residents while allowing them to maintain safe physical distance for prayer during the coronavirus pandemic.
  Ramadan starts Thursday and ends May 23.
