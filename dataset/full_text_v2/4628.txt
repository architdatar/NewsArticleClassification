   Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin extended the Russian capital’s strict lockdown until May 31, according to an order announced Thursday. 
  Industrial and construction enterprises can return to work on May 12, but the remainder of the city's social and economic life will remain frozen.
  Moscow residents will still need passes to leave their homes for most activities — save for grocery shopping, walking pets and taking out the trash.
  And as of May 12, residents will also face a new requirement to wear masks when going to buy groceries or ride public transport.
  Sobyanin said a recent spike in new cases was the result of expanded testing, and that hospitalizations remain stable.
