  United Airlines is scaling back flights to two New York City-area airports in an effort to reduce the number of employees who report there. 
  "The goal is to keep our employees safe and play our part in helping to mitigate the spread of the outbreak in the Tri-State area," United said in a statement, adding that all employees at Newark Liberty International Airport and LaGuardia Airport will receive their full salaries and benefits despite the schedule reductions.
  United said it will continue to serve all of its domestic and international markets at this time.
