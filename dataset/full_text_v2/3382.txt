  Georgia's shelter-in-place order will expire at 11:59 pm ET on Thursday night for most of the state and not be extended, Gov. Brian Kemp announced. 
  The governor said Thursday that though he was lifting the mandatory lockdown measures, he urged residents to voluntarily remain home and said any opened businesses should maintain social distancing guidelines. Kemp signed a new order that required "medically fragile and elderly Georgians" to remain sheltered in place until June 12.
  "The health and well-being of Georgians are my top priorities, and my decisions are based on data and advice from health officials," Kemp said Thursday. "I will do what is necessary to protect the lives — and livelihoods — of our people."
  Although many  states have chosen to loosen restrictions  in an effort to reopen the economy, high-ranking health officials have warned that it may be too soon.
  Dr. Anthony Fauci  told NBC's "Today" on Thursday  that states must have the capability of identifying, isolating and contact tracing people who test positive or they risk a rebound in cases. 
  Today we are taking another measured step to protect the lives - and livelihoods - of all Georgians. We will continue to work around the clock to follow the data, heed the advice of public health officials, and keep Georgia families safe.  pic.twitter.com/kPFjAfDApW
