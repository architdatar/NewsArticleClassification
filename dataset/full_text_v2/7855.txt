  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has upheld  California Gov. Gavin Newsom's ban on gatherings at houses of worship , denying an emergency motion that sought to resume in-person services while the case is appealed.
  South Bay United Pentecostal Church in Chula Vista had argued the ban violated its freedom of religion, but a federal court in San Diego upheld Newsom's prohibition on May 15.
  On Friday a three-judge appeals panel voted 3-2 in favor of the state, saying plaintiffs had little chance of winning their appeal. The majority agreed with the state's argument that "constitutional rights may be reasonably restricted" in extraordinary circumstances.
  A long dissent from Judge Daniel Collins, an appointee of President Donald Trump, argued the state's ban "likely violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment." The church's pastor, Arthur E. Hodges III,  vowed to reopen May 31 .
