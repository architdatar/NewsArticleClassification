  A new week in the  coronavirus pandemic  is beginning with a United States case count approaching 1 million and several cities and states preparing to loosen stay-at-home restrictions. At least  54,883 coronavirus deaths  and more than 965,000 cases have been recorded in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University.  As the numbers continue to climb, several state and city officials are expected to announce  plans to reopen their economies  this week. A  University of Washington model  frequently cited by the White House  coronavirus task force  suggests that no state should open their economies before Friday -- and many should wait much longer.  In New York, one of the hardest hit states, rates of hospitalization, intubation and deaths are down, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. Officials at all levels of government are weighing how to proceed and when to reopen their communities. Meanwhile, several states also are grappling with an increase in calls to their poison control centers, following President Donald Trump's suggestion of injecting disinfectants as a treatment for the coronavirus during a White House briefing on Thursday. He later said he was  being "sarcastic."   Read the full story  here .

  Mateship, an egalitarian concept, is characterized by ingenuity, honesty, humor, courage and compassion. It calls on communities to come together during hardship, adapt to challenging circumstances and provide a fair go for all. Anzac Day:  For 15-year-old Australian Patrick Stibbard, mateship means looking out for one another. On Saturday, like millions of other Australians and New Zealanders, he stood on his driveway to commemorate Anzac Day and to the lives lost during war. Traditional dawn services were canceled this year due to the coronavirus lockdown, but the 60 seconds of silence felt all the more poignant this year. It was a tribute not only to those who served and sacrificed on battlefields abroad, but also the frontline heroes fighting Covid-19 right now at home. Passing the baton:  For 240 days over the summer, wildfires blazed across Australia, killing 33 people, over a billion animals, and destroying thousands of houses. Before flowers had time to sprout through the ashes, the nation was already grappling with a new crisis, the global coronavirus pandemic. Firefighters passed the baton to health care workers, in what will be remembered as the year of the frontline worker. From those in uniform to ordinary Aussies, mateship is "understanding that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a huge difference," according to Erin Boutros, the co-founder of volunteer group Empty Esky.

  Singapore recorded 799 new cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours before noon local time on Monday, according to a statement by the country's Ministry of Health.  Among the new cases, 14 are Singaporeans or permanent residents, while the vast majority are work permit holders in foreign worker dormitories.  In recent weeks, the Asian city-state has recorded a dramatic spike in coronavirus infections, with thousands of new cases linked to clusters in foreign worker dormitories. To control the spread, the government has attempted to isolate the dormitories, test workers and move symptomatic patients into quarantine facilities. Singapore has recorded more than 13,000 coronavirus cases -- the highest in Southeast Asia -- and at least 12 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

  The UK government’s promise to reach 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by Thursday is “quite a challenge," said Michael Malim, the head of immunology and microbial sciences at King’s College London. The Department of Health and Social Care said 29,058 tests were carried out on Saturday, although the government says the capacity is much higher. “I think 100,000 by Thursday would be quite a challenge,” Malim told Sky News. “But it’s definitely ramping up in this country and even if we don’t meet 100,000, if we get up closer to that, that would be a major advance.” 
  Malim added that a more reasonable time frame for the UK to be able to test 100,000 a day would be “within two or three weeks." The UK government has faced criticism for low levels of testing, although Health Secretary Matt Hancock remains confident the 100,000 target will be reached by the end of April.

  The novel coronavirus has now infected nearly 3 million people and killed at least 206,553 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. If you're just joining us, here's the latest on the pandemic: Britain's PM back in action:  Boris Johnson will return to work today after recovering from coronavirus. He left hospital on Easter Sunday. Germany masks:  People across almost all of the country are required to wear face coverings in public spaces as of Monday. Different states have different rules but most require citizens to cover their mouths and noses in stores and on public transport. US health secretary's job safe:  President Donald Trump has denied he is about to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar after reports suggested White House officials were looking at the possibility of replacing him. Food supply concerns:  Tyson Foods  is warning  that "millions of pounds of meat" will disappear from the US supply chain as the coronavirus pandemic  pushes food processing plants to close , leading to product shortages in grocery stores across the country. Loosening lockdowns in Europe:  Switzerland   will allow some businesses like hairdressers and DIY stores to reopen today, while Italy plans to ease some measures on May 4. However, the UK is "not there yet" on lifting restrictions, according to a junior health minister. New Zealand eases restrictions:  The country   will lift some of its strictest lockdown measures at midnight local time. Schools can open, people will be able to buy takeaway food, and take part in more recreational activities. Economic impact:  The Bank of Japan expects the country’s economy to contract by 3% to 5% this year -- a sharp departure from its forecast at the start of the year, which predicted slight growth.

  2:49 a.m. ET, April 27, 2020 UK "not there yet" on lifting coronavirus restrictions From CNN's From Simon Cullen Now is not the time to ease the coronavirus lockdown, British junior health minister Edward Argar said on Monday. “We’ll be led by the science on this. And at the moment, the science isn’t saying we are ready to lift the restrictions that have been placed on people,” Argar told Sky News. 
  Argar said the nation has "made huge progress … but we’re not there yet." He added that the lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom were working and that "now is not the time to let up.” Many countries across Europe, including Switzerland and Italy, are starting to relax some of the rules that were introduced to curb the spread of the virus. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is returning to work on Monday and will chair the government’s daily coronavirus meeting in the morning. The UK has reported at least 154,037 coronavirus cases and   20,795 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

  2:29 a.m. ET, April 27, 2020 "The food supply chain is breaking," Tyson says as plants close From CNN's Rob McLean Tyson Foods is warning that "millions of pounds of meat" will disappear from the supply chain as the coronavirus pandemic  pushes food processing plants to close , leading to product shortages in grocery stores across the country. "The food supply chain is breaking," wrote board chairman John Tyson in a full-page advertisement published Sunday in The New York Times, Washington Post and Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. US farmers don't have anywhere to sell their livestock, he said, adding that "millions of animals -- chickens, pigs and cattle -- will be depopulated because of the closure of our processing facilities." "There will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed," Tyson wrote. 
  Tyson Foods , which employs roughly 100,000 workers,  closed its pork plants  in Waterloo, Iowa, and Logansport, Indiana, last week so that workers in those facilities could be tested for the virus. Read the full story here:

  2:15 a.m. ET, April 27, 2020 Almost all of Germany now required to wear masks in public From CNN’s Fred Pleitgen in Berlin A woman with a face mask sits in a bus in Berlin, Germany, on April 22. Markus Schreiber/AP 
  Almost all of Germany's 83 million population will be required to wear face coverings in public spaces as of Monday, according to announcements on federal state websites. Germany is a decentralized country so every state has its own set of rules.  Here's a breakdown of when and where you need to wear a mask: The capital Berlin is the most lax, with masks only required when riding public transport.  All other states require citizens to cover their mouths and noses in stores and on public transport. Germany’s largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, requires citizens to cover their mouth and nose when visiting doctors and when they receive handy workers in their homes. In the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein the law requiring masks does not go into effect until Wednesday. 
  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government urgently recommended citizens to wear masks in public when it loosened some of the restrictions placed on public life to combat the coronavirus pandemic a week ago.  But all German states have since separately enacted laws making the wearing of face coverings a requirement in some public spaces.
