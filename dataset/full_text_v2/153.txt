  Connie Titchen, a 106-year-old great-grandmother from Birmingham, England, was released from the hospital this week after enduring a three-week battle with COVID-19. She is believed to be Britain’s oldest patient to recover from the coronavirus, according to the  Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust . 
  Video  posted on social media shows health care workers at City Hospital lining the hallway to applaud Titchen as she was discharged.
  “I feel very lucky that I’ve fought off this virus. I can’t wait to see my family,” Titchen said in a  statement released by the NHS . Born in 1913, Titchen has lived through two World Wars and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.
