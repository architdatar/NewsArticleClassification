  Uber and Lyft customers will no longer be able to request shared rides due to the coronavirus pandemic.
  Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of Uber Rides and Platform, said in a series of  tweets  on Tuesday that the company hopes by suspending its UberPool in the United States and Canada it can "help flatten the curve of community spread in the cities we serve."
  Lyft announced a similar plan, saying in a statement that it is "pausing Shared rides across all of our markets."Â
