  A growing number of colleges, including The Ohio State University and San Francisco State University, have suspended face-to-face classes amid fears of growing coronavirus cases in the United States.
  OSU  in a statement  noted that while there are no campus-associated cases of COVID-19, "we know that there are at least three confirmed cases in the state of Ohio, and we expect that there will be more." It is suspending face-to-face instruction and moving to virtual interactions through at least March 30.
  San Francisco State said that all face-to-face courses will be suspended, but the campus is not being closed. The city and county of San Francisco on Thursday announced two presumptive positive cases.Â UC San Diego  said Monday  that starting in Spring Quarter all lecture and discussion courses will be delivered remotely. UC Berkeley said  starting Tuesday  it is suspending most in-person classes and will be offering classes remotely.
