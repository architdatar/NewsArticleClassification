  New York state is partnering with churches to ramp up coronavirus testing for communities of color, who have been hit hardest by the pandemic.
  "We must address the racial disparities of this pandemic, and meet the need where it is," Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at  a news conference  Saturday morning.
  The state is working with nonprofit health care network  Northwell Health  to open more than 20 temporary testing sites in churches located in predominantly low-income areas as well as in communities of color starting on May 12.
  While the overall number of coronavirus hospitalizations and intubations continue to decline in New York, the majority of new cases have been reported in minority communities, Cuomo said.
  Black people make up 28 percent of new coronavirus hospitalizations in New York City, although they are 23 percent of the population, the governor said.
  "Of the 21 zip codes with the most new COVID-19 hospitalizations, 20 have greater-than-average black and/or Latino populations," he said.
