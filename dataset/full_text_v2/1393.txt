  The Cannes Film Festival will not take place this year in "its original form" due to the  coronavirus  pandemic, but organizers said they continue to review options for the event.
  French President Emmanuel Macron announced this week that he was extending a national lockdown to curb the outbreak and that public events including festivals could not be held until mid-July.
  "We acknowledged that the postponement of the 73rd International Cannes Film Festival, initially considered for the end of June to the beginning of July, is no longer an option,‚Äù organizers said in a statement. "It is clearly difficult to assume that the Festival de Cannes could be held this year in its original form."
