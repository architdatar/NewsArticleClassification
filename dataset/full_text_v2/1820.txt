  Bill Gates warned on Friday that the new coronavirus "has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we’ve been worried about."
  "I hope it’s not that bad, but we should assume it will be until we know otherwise," Gates wrote in the  New England Journal of Medicine. 
  Gates' foundation has been promoting vaccine research for developing nations for more than a decade. He noted that the combination of the fatality rate of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the new coronavirus) and its ease of transmission between people make it a serious threat.  
  Gates said he is ready to commit up to $100 million to fight the spread of the virus in "low- and middle-income countries."
