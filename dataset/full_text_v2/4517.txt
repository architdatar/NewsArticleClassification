  A voter initiative led by Michelle Obama announced support Monday for making it easier for people to register to vote and cast ballots during the coronavirus pandemic.
  When We All Vote , a nonpartisan voting initiative, says Americans should have greater access to voting by mail, early in-person voting and online voter registration.
  The announcement follows last week’s  primary election in Wisconsin , where thousands of people waited hours in line — without protective gear and in defiance of orders to stay home — after the state Supreme Court overturned the governor’s order to postpone the vote as more than a dozen other states have done because of  the pandemic . Thousands of other Wisconsin voters, unwilling to risk their health, stayed home.
  When We All Vote’s announcement also comes amid vociferous  opposition by President Donald Trump  to mail-in voting.
