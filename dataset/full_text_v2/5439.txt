  Good morning, Power Peeps. I'm no  Josh Gondelman  but feeling like we've definitely entered the pep talk phase of the pandemic. Try giving someone a pep talk today or feel free to shoot me an email if you need a little pick me up: jacqueline.alemany@washpost.com 🤗Thanks for waking up with us.  
  TEST THIS:  President Trump acknowledged over a week ago that the novel  coronavirus  is infecting and killing black Americans at a disproportionately high rate, promising his administration was “doing everything in our power to address this challenge.” 
  But black lawmakers argue the Trump administration isn't attacking the problem. Due to the  lingering lack  of widespread testing, the federal government hasn't collected the data necessary to address  racial and ethnic disparities in cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  
  The problem:  A  Washington Post analysis conducted  showed “c ounties that are majority-black have three times the rate of infections and almost six times the rate of deaths as counties where white residents are in the majority.” The reasons for this  range  from  overall bias in the health-care system, to higher rates of underlying conditions liked diabetes and high blood pressure, a lack of access to testing to minority Americans making up a larger share of essential workers.
  “We're fighting for more testing,”  Rep.  Gregory W. Meeks  (D-N.Y.) told Power up on Wednesday after the CBC held a remote meeting earlier in the day. “We n eed all kinds of data — not just for death rates but infection rates, level of hospitalizations, recovery rates.  We need all of the data.  That’s how we know how and where to focus and without the data we can't do that.”
  ‘Faith in Fauci’:  Rep. Robin L. Kelly (D-Ill.), who chairs the Health Braintrust of the Congressional Black Caucus, confirmed the  CBC lawmakers on Monday talked to  Anthony S. Fauci , one of Trump's top pandemic advisers and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. He agreed that lack of testing in hard-hit communities was an issue. 
  Medicare chief Seema Verma said last week that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid would start providing comprehensive data on minority communities “very shortly.” But Politico's Dan Diamond reports “two officials in her department [ said]  no such release is imminent or has been marked as a priority ”   —  even though former Obama officials said CMS already is equipped to monitor demographic data.  
  Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill on Tuesday, the “ Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on C ovid-19  Act ,” that would compel federal health officials to collect and report demographic data on virus statistics and make public final statistics on the pandemic's victims no later than 60 days after the end of the public health emergency.  
  Meeks and Kelly told Power Up that targeted testing efforts should include testing sites and mobile testing in disproportionately affected areas  —  like public housing facilities and essential work places where black Americans are more likely to be working .  They said a fourth stimulus package is necessary to buoy underserved  Zip codes   —  from hospitals to community health centers to small businesses.  
  Rashawn Ray, a Brookings Institution fellow and University of Maryland professor, told us the Trump administration should take a “ health equity approach ” to the pandemic instead of a “colorblind approach.” This includes not only building out testing and triage centers in black neighborhoods but making sure essential workers receive paid leave, hazard pay, and a living wage, according to Ray. 
  Note to readers: Yesterday's  newsletter  quoted Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)'s February comments on Fox News stating the novel coronavirus could have come from a Chinese lab instead of from the Wuhan seafood market as claimed by Chinese officials. Cotton believes the likely source of transmission was natural, and perhaps from an "accidental breach" at a Chinese lab researching the virus. 
  BUSTED OPEN:  “Trump’s attempt to enlist corporate executives in a push to reopen parts of society got off to a rocky start with some business leaders complaining the effort was haphazard and warning that more testing needs to be in place before restrictions are lifted,”  Robert Costa, Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Felicia Sonmez report .
  Business executives begged for more widespread testing,  according to several participants :  “Public health experts have argued that widespread testing is a key prerequisite to reopening the economy because it would determine who is infected and needs to be isolated, giving Americans greater confidence that they can safely return to work and public life,” our colleagues write. 
  Participants say Trump is sticking to his May 1 reopening plan, which administration officials plan to roll out today:  “'Trump made it very clear he was ready to go on May 1,'” a person on one of the afternoon calls told our colleagues. “The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private call, added that Trump seemed to bask in the praise from CEOs, who repeatedly opened their comments with compliments for the president.”
  TRUMP THREATENS TO ADJOURN CONGRESS:  “Trump threatened to try to force Congress to adjourn so he could fill his administration’s vacancies without Senate approval, the second time this week he has claimed unprecedented executive authority amid the coronavirus pandemic,”  Colby Itkowitz and Mike DeBonis report .  Constitutionally, the House and Senate would have to disagree with each other on the time of adjournment to make such a move even feasible. 
  Pattern:  The warning came after Trump  incorrectly claimed  Monday he alone can reopen the country, even if governors disagree, and  he pushed  for his name to be printed on the thousands of stimulus checks being delivered to Americans.
  But can he do that?:  “Article II, section 3 of the Constitution says the president ‘may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper,’" our colleagues write.
  ANGER RISES OVER STAY AT HOME ORDERS:  “Demonstrators drove thousands of vehicles — many draped with protest signs — to Michigan's state Capitol … loudly protesting Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order intended to fight the coronavirus pandemic,”  the Detroit Free Press's Paul Egan and Kara Berg report  from Lansing.
  Michigan's initial stay-at-home order was met with little opposition:  “ But an extension of the order that included additional restrictions on business and individual activity was widely panned by Republican lawmakers and conservatives, who felt the order went too far and didn’t take into account businesses that could operate safely,” MLive reports. 
  The backlash is happening beyond just Michigan:  Protests have occurred in North Carolina, Kentucky and another rally is scheduled in Virginia today. Those three states all have Democratic governors, but protests have also occurred in Utah and Ohio where Republicans are charge. 
  WARREN ENDORSES BIDEN:  “In a sign of her stature coming out of the presidential contest, [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren earned a slot in Biden’s week of premier endorsements, officially giving him her support. She followed former president Barack Obama, who endorsed Biden on Tuesday, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the last competitor to leave the presidential race, who backed Biden on Monday,”  Annie Linskey reports .
  The Massachusetts senator's allies are pondering her future:  “Allies who have spoken to her since she left the race have touted her as a potential partner for Biden, who has pledged that a woman will be his running mate. Failing that, they envision her securing a leading role in his administration should he win in November — potentially as the country’s first female treasury secretary or running the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped create,” our colleagues write. Another alternative is to remain in the Senate and play a more prominent role in the chamber.
  VEEP WATCH, STACEY ABRAMS:  “E xperienced politicians know there is a right way to answer questions about pursuing higher office. Be demure. Redirect. Convey vague interest while insisting never to have given it serious consideration. But Stacey Abrams does not give the expected answer when I ask …,”  Melissa Harris-Perry writes in Elle . 
  WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW: 
  Worldwide infections have surpassed 2 million:  “Confirmed coronavirus infections around the world surged past 2 million on Wednesday, with nearly a third of those in the United States, where  more than 28,000  people have died in recent weeks during the pandemic,”  Brady Dennis reports .
  The search for a covid-19 treatment is also chaotic:  “The massive effort is disorganized and scattershot, harming its prospects for success, according to multiple researchers and health experts. Researchers working around-the-clock describe a lack of a centralized national strategy, overlapping efforts, an array of small-scale trials that will not lead to definitive answers and no standards for how to prioritize efforts, what data to collect or how to share it to get to answers faster,”  Carolyn Y. Johnson reports .
  Trump's move to cut off WHO funding was spurred on by conservative allies:  “[Trump’s] decision on Tuesday to freeze nearly $500 million in public money for [the World Health Organization] in the middle of a pandemic was the culmination of a concerted conservative campaign against the group. But the president’s announcement on the WHO drew fierce condemnations from many quarters,”  the New York Times Michael D. Shear reports .
  The NFL is making contingency plans to play without fans:  “While still publicly committed to kicking off its 2020 season in September to packed stadiums, the NFL has been contemplating contingencies that include a potentially shortened schedule, holding games in empty or partially filled stadiums, and moving or rescheduling games if necessary, three people familiar with the league’s planning said,”  Mark Maske and Dave Sheinin scoop.
