  India has surpassed Brazil as the country with the second-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases after reporting a fresh daily high of 90,802 new infections on Monday. India's total number of cases now stands at 4,204,613, according to the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. In comparison, Brazil has confirmed 4,137,521 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.  India is the world's second most populous nation, home to more than 1.3 billion people -- more than six times the population of Brazil. The United States remains the country with the highest number of recorded cases. As of Sunday night, the US had reported 6,275,643 cases, according to JHU. Low death rate:  As of Monday,   India had recorded 71,642 virus-related deaths, far below the US at nearly 189,000 deaths and Brazil's more than 126,000 fatalities. India's death rate of five virus-related fatalities per 100,000 people is lower than more than 80 countries and territories, according to JHU data. For comparison, the US death rate is 58 per 100,000 people, while Brazil's is 60 per 100,000 people, according to JHU. Reopening:  The rapid rise in infections in India comes after the government announced a  new phase of reopening  last week. Subway trains will be allowed to run for the first time in months from September 7 while gatherings of up to 100 people will be permitted at sports, entertainment, cultural and religious events outside of hotspot areas from September 21. Schools and colleges will remain closed until the end of September. CNN is tracking worldwide coronavirus cases here:

  12:08 a.m. ET, September 7, 2020 India didn't prioritize mental health before Covid-19. Now it's paying the price From CNN's Esha Mitra in New Delhi "My heartbeats are heavy. It becomes difficult to catch my breath. My hands shake and get sweaty," said Aritri Paul of the terrifying panic attacks that strike more frequently since India went into coronavirus lockdown in March. India's government started easing the most severe restrictions on daily life in June, but the effects of the lockdown on residents' mental health are still emerging, as the country battles one of the most severe  Covid-19 outbreaks in the world .  India now has over  4.1 million cases  of the virus, giving it the third-highest tally of recorded cases globally, behind the Unites States and Brazil. "The worst are the headaches and the pain in my eyes," said Paul, who lives in Kolkata, West Bengal. "I have had more panic attacks this year than in my entire life combined." 
  Research conducted by the Suicide Prevention in India Foundation (SPIF) in May found that nearly 65% of 159 mental health professionals surveyed reported an increase in self-harm among their patients. More than 85% of therapists surveyed said they were experiencing caregiver fatigue, and over 75% said fatigue had impacted their work. Another survey in April, by the Indian Psychiatric Society, showed that, of 1,685 participants, 40% were suffering from common mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression, due to the pandemic.

The students were part of the  N.U.in Program , a study abroad experience for first-year students, the university said. The program was modified because of  the coronavirus pandemic , and over 800 students are staying in two-person rooms at a Westin Hotel less than one mile from the school's main campus in Boston, Massachusetts. The 11 students were found together in a room at the Westin on Wednesday night, the school said. The students and their parents were told Friday they must vacate the hotel within 24 hours and that they are required to undergo Covid-19 testing at Northeastern. "Northeastern and its community of students, faculty, and staff take violations of health and safety protocols very seriously," said Madeleine Estabrook, senior vice chancellor for student affairs at Northeastern. "Cooperation and compliance with public health guidelines is absolutely essential ... Testing negative for COVID-19 is not enough."

  The state of New York has maintained a positive Covid-19 infection rate below 1% for 30 straight days, a release from Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office said.  The state had a positive infection rate of 0.85% reported Saturday, the release said. Hospitalizations across the state have dropped to 410, which is the lowest number since March 16, according to the release.  "We know based on experience that an incremental, data-driven reopening is the best way to protect the health and safety of all New Yorkers. As this virus continues to be a national crisis, it's clear that caution is a virtue, not a vice," Cuomo said. 
  The governor added:  "Our infection rate has been below 1% for 30 days, and New Yorkers can help us keep that streak going by wearing masks, socially distancing, and washing their hands. Our actions today determine the rate of infection tomorrow, so as the Labor Day weekend continues, I urge everyone to be smart so we don't see a spike in the weeks ahead."

  8:04 a.m. ET, September 7, 2020 Kamala Harris hits Trump administration for coronavirus response From CNN's Ryan Struyk With a  US death toll of more than 188,000 , Democratic vice presidential nominee  Kamala Harris  attacked the Trump administration for "minimizing the seriousness" of the coronavirus outbreak and failing to do enough for millions of American struggling to make ends meet. "There is no question that Donald Trump has been an abject failure and incompetent when it comes to addressing the severe job loss that has happened as a result of the pandemic, because he has failed to address the pandemic itself," Harris told CNN's Dana Bash in an exclusive "State of the Union" interview on Sunday. "We need to talk about how the economy is doing based on how working people are doing. And right now, working people are suffering." 
  The unemployment rate in the United States stands at  8.4% , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. That's down from a high of 14.7% in April, but still far from the pre-pandemic unemployment rate of 3.5% in February. Harris continued to say  she would not trust Trump's word alone  on the safety and efficacy of a coronavirus vaccine, but said she "would trust the word of public health experts and scientists," including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "Joe Biden and I have a plan," Harris said on vaccine distribution. "Donald Trump does not." 
  Trump said Friday he believed a coronavirus vaccine could "probably" come sometime in the month of October, though experts agree it is more likely to come later. Asked whether she believes states should mandate a vaccine for public school students along with other vaccinations, Harris said she would listen to public health experts. Harris also declined to back a mask mandate on a federal level, instead calling for a "national standard." "This is not about punishment. It's not about big brother," Harris said. "We have a President of the United States who made this a partisan issue," she continued. "The virus could care less who you voted for in the last election or who you plan to vote for in the next election. We need leadership that appreciates that, on certain issues, they should not be partisan. Wearing a mask certainly shouldn't be one of them." Read the full story:

  The United Kingdom has recorded 2,988 new Covid-19 cases in a 24-hour period -- the highest daily number since May, according to government figures published on Sunday. The UK’s total number of recorded cases now stands at 347,152.  In addition, two Covid-19 patients have died, bringing the UK government's official death toll to 41,551. In response to the new figures, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: "Cases rising across the UK - 2988 being reported today compared to 1813 yesterday. This reminds us again of the need to be very vigilant and comply with all the facts." 
  Comparisons should be made with caution because the number of tests being processed has increased since May.
