  Spanish lawmakers voted Thursday evening to extend state of emergency measures until April 26, as the country battles the  coronavirus  outbreak.
  The measures prolong the state of emergency for a second time in Spain, which has the world’s second-highest coronavirus death toll, and also included economic and labor decrees to help alleviate the crisis.
  The outbreak has led to a  near-collapse of Spain's health system  as the country reported more than 15,000 deaths  as of Friday, according to an NBC News tally. The daily rate of infection, however, has  started to slow . 
  As Spanish citizens will now be under compulsory lockdown for a total of six weeks, the Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned that he may need to ask for a third extension to prolong measures until May.
