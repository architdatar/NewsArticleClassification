  The coronavirus has claimed the lives of  at least 270 New York City  public employees, including health workers and emergency medical services employees, and Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that City Hall wants to provide all of their families death benefits that are usually reserved for first responders who die in the line of duty.
  The city will work with state lawmakers to put into effect the additional payments, which include pension benefits passed on to survivors.
  "It's so important for us to say to their families that, 'We will be there for you,' not just words but deeds,” de Blasio told reporters. "Your loved ones gave their all to us; we will there for you."
