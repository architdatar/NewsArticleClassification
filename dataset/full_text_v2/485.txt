  Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced Thursday that her  coronavirus-stricken husband  has been released from the hospital.
  "He took a good turn, was just released and is now recovering at home. Thanks to those who cared for him and for all front line health care workers,” the Minnesota senator said in a statement. She also offered “Thanks to all who sent kind words and prayers."
  Klobuchar revealed Monday her husband, John Bessler,  was in the hospital . Klobuchar said he'd had a persistent temperature and a “bad, bad” cough and then began coughing up blood. He checked into a hospital in Virginia and had “pneumonia and is on oxygen but not a ventilator,” she said then.
  Klobuchar did not get tested - the former Democratic presidential candidate said she and her husband had been in “different places for the last two weeks” and was “outside the 14-day period for getting sick.”
