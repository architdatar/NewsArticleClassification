  The Trump administration's coronavirus task force announced Wednesday a counter-narcotics operation to combat drug trafficking amid the pandemic. 
  President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House briefing that Defense Secretary Mark Esper will lead the effort. Esper said that the operation will begin immediately in the eastern Pacific and the Caribbean Sea. He said additional ships, aircraft, and forces will deploy to the region. 
  Esper said criminal organizations are attempting to “capitalize” on coronavirus outbreak. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said U.S. intelligence came upon information “some time ago” that drug cartels are trying to take advantage of the pandemic. 
  “We’re at war with COVID-19, we’re at war with terrorists, and we’re at war with the drug cartels as well," Milley said.
  Attorney General Bill Barr said the Justice Department has had “successful visits and discussions” with Mexican officials about joint work towards combatting the cartels. Last week the department unsealed charges against the former president of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro Moros and several former members of his regime.
