  A Georgia man who allegedly faked a  coronavirus  diagnosis to his employer, leading the business to temporarily shut down, is facing federal charges.
  Santwon Antonio Davis, 34, of Morrow, about 15 miles south of Atlanta, is charged with defrauding his employer after he allegedly faked a medical excuse letter. He has since admitted to authorities that he did not have the virus, according to a  press release  from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta.
  Davis, who was employed by an unidentified Fortune 500 company, told his supervisors in March that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and emailed a letter stating that he had been admitted to the hospital and needed to quarantine for 14 days, an affidavit states.
  Out of an abundance of caution, the company shut down for cleaning, and at least four workers had to quarantine.
  “The defendant caused unnecessary economic loss to his employer and distress to his coworkers and their families,” said U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak for the Northern District of Georgia.
