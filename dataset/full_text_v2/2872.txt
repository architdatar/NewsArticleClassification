  A emergency  field hospital being hastily  built at the home of the Seattle Seahawks will be shut down before it even opened, and materials sent to other places in need, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Wednesday.
  The announcement came  just two days after the  Department of Defense said the temporary medical facility at the CenturyLink Field Event Center would be open this week, intended to take non-coronavirus patients and relieve the burden of hospitals being overwhelmed with COVID-19 victims.
  "To be clear, this doesn’t mean we’re out of the woods. We can’t let up in our fight against COVID-19," Inslee said in a statement.
  Today we’re returning the field hospital stationed at Century Link to  @FEMA  so it can be redeployed to a state with a more significant need. I’m proud that our diligence has saved lives across the state, and am even more proud that we can now help save lives across the country.
