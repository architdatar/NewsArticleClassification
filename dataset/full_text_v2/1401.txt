  China has sent a plane loaded with medical personnel and supplies to aid Pakistan — one of the world’s most populous nations — in the fight against the virus spread, the Pakistani foreign ministry said Saturday.
  Pakistan is a key link in China’s multi-billion-dollar One Road Project linking south and central Asia with China. China is also a key military supplier for nuclear-armed Pakistan, having supplied the country with missiles capable of carrying atomic weapons.
  Pakistan currently has 1,321 confirmed cases of the virus, including 10 deaths from the illness. Most of the infected people there were travelers returning from neighboring Iran, the  worst-affected nation  in the Middle East.
  Across the Middle East, the outbreak has raised concerns that health systems strapped by multiple wars, refugee crises and unstable economies won’t be able to handle a growing numbers in cases.
