  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday the nation's largest city has recorded 5,151 coronavirus cases and 29 deaths.
  "We are now the epicenter of this crisis," he said.
  De Blasio calculated the city has about a third of the nation's cases overall, although a lag in testing in some areas could distort the numbers.
  He criticized the federal government's response, saying, "Everything makes sense until you get to the federal government. Mobilize our armed forces - we need their ability."
  De Blasio said he would ask police to  enforce social distancing  at crowded markets.
