  A major supermarket chain in Australia opened earlier than usual on Tuesday dedicating a shopping hour for the elderly and the disabled as anxiety over the coronavirus increases.
  Shoppers waited outside Woolworths supermarkets chain waiting for a chance to buy necessities before stores opened to the general public.
  The move comes after the country witnessed panic buying in recent weeks, especially for toilet paper, rice, pasta and frozen foods.
  Similar "elderly hours" were also reported in shops in Iceland and Canada.Â
