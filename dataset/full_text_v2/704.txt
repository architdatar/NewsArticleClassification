  Al Sharpton  admonished NFL commissioner Roger Goodell  at George Floyd's funeral on Tuesday, stating he should allow Colin Kaepernick to return to the league.
  "Oh, it's nice to see some people change their mind," Sharpton said during a eulogy at the funeral in Houston. "The head of the NFL said,  'Yeah. Maybe we was wrong.  Football players, maybe they did have the right to peacefully protest.'"
  "Well, don't apologize — give Colin Kaepernick a job back," Sharpton said. His remarks were met with loud applause from the congregation.
