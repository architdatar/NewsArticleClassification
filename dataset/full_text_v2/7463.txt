  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he is not sure whether he will wear a face mask Thursday when he visits a Ford factory in Michigan, appearing to go against Ford's safety protocols.
  "I don’t know, I haven’t even thought of it," Trump said during a cabinet meeting at the White House when asked by reporters if he planned to wear a mask. "It depends, I mean, you know, certain areas I would and certain areas I don’t, but I will certainly look at it."
  Ford said that their policy "is that everyone wears PPE to prevent the spread of COVID-19."
  “We have shared our policies and recommendations. The White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination," Ford added. 
  Trump said he would determine whether to wear a mask depending on the place he was visiting.
  "Is something a hospital? Is it a ward? Is it, what is it exactly? I’m going to a plant, so we’ll see. Where it’s appropriate I would do it, certainly," he said. 
  Trump has been criticized for not wearing a face mask to factory tours in Arizona and Pennsylvania. In private, Trump has worried that wearing a mask would send the wrong message and make him look  ridiculous .
