  Russia's nationwide vote on constitutional amendments slated for April 22 was postponed Wednesday as the number of coronavirus cases in the country surged. 
  President Vladimir Putin said the vote has been put off "until a later date" without offering more specifics.
  He also announced that next week will be a national paid holiday, with no one but essential personnel going to work. 
  "Believe me, the safest thing to do right now is to be at home," Putin added. 
  The number of coronavirus cases in Russia surged to 658 on Wednesday, government officials said.
