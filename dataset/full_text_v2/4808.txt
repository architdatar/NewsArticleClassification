  The Archdiocese of New York has taken the extraordinary step of cancelling all Masses starting this weekend in light of coronavirus, the church announced Saturday.
  This includes all of New York City and the southern tier of the state. Churches will remain open for private prayer, the archdiocese said in its statement. 
  A private Mass will be celebrated in St. Patrick's Cathedral and livestreamed on the church's website.
