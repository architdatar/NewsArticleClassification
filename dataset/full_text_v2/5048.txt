  Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and his chief medical officer, Amy Acton, whose daily coronavirus briefings have become must-see TV in the Buckeye state, are now starring in their own cartoon.
  Inspired by the iconic opening scene and theme song from the classic “Laverne & Shirley” sitcom, local ad man  Dave Stofka has created a cartoon tribute  to DeWine and Acton.
  Both have been praised for taking early and decisive action to keep the coronavirus from spreading.
