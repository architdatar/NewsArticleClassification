  8:04 a.m. ET, March 27, 2020 Criminals are taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis, EU warns From CNN's Radina Gigova Criminals are taking advantage of the global coronavirus crisis and their activity is expected to rise as the pandemic drags on, Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, said in a new report Friday. "Criminals have been quick to seize opportunities to exploit the crisis by adapting their modi operandi or engaging in new criminal activities," Europol said.  
  The number of cyberattacks against organizations and individuals is "significant and is expected to increase," Europol said. A cyberattack on Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic forced the hospital to shut down its entire IT network, postpone urgent surgical interventions and re-route new acute patients to a nearby hospital. A large number of new or adapted fraud schemes, such as telephone schemes, supply scams and decontamination scams, can also be expected to emerge over the coming weeks as "fraudsters will attempt to capitalize further on the anxieties of people across Europe," the agency said.   The sale of counterfeit healthcare and sanitary products, as well as personal protective equipment and counterfeit pharmaceutical products, has also increased "manifold" since the start of the outbreak. Between March 3 and 10 alone, authorities have seized over 34,000 counterfeit surgical masks.  Europol said organized property theft is also on the rise. Multiple EU member states have reported cases where perpetrators gain access to private homes by impersonating medical staff providing informational material or hygiene products, or conducting a "corona test."

  The first case of novel coronavirus has been confirmed in a Kremlin staffer, Russian president’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday. “Indeed there are cases of the coronavirus within the administration,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters when asked to comment on recent media reports.  I know of one case and I can confirm it, I’m not aware of a second one... all necessary epidemiological measures are being taken to prevent the virus from spreading further." 
  According to Peskov, President Vladimir Putin was not in contact with the person who tested positive. “The President continues to work, he cannot just stop,” Peskov said. "This once again proves the precautionary measures such as inviting everyone who attends the events with the President’s participation to undergo testing are justified."

  6:51 a.m. ET, March 27, 2020 Chinese government investigating test kit maker which supplied Spain From Shanshan Wang in Beijing, Max Ramsay in London, Ingrid Formanek, Laura Perez-Maestro, and Al Goodman in Spain, and Mia Alberti in Lisbon A Chinese government regulatory group said on Friday it has launched an investigation into Covid-19 test kit maker which supplied test kits to Spain that were recalled. On Thursday, the Spanish government said it was recalling 9,000 kits after finding the results to be “unreliable.” The tests, made by the Chinese company "Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology" were bought "some weeks ago" through a Spanish supplier that imported them from China, the Spanish government said in a statement sent to CNN. When the equipment was tested by Spanish authorities before being put into use, they didn't meet quality levels. Obviously there was an obligation to return the batches and the supplier is going to change them,” Spanish health ministry official Fernando Simón said at the government’s daily coronavirus briefing. “Also, the health ministry is exploring other providers to provide rapid tests", he said. 
  The Shenzhen Market Supervisions Administration said on its Weibo account Friday it has launched an investigation into Bioeasy. Bioeasy posted a statement on its WeChat account Friday to say that the nasopharyngeal swab samples might have been sampled, extracted and handled without strictly following the company's instructions, reducing the accuracy of the tests. Bioeasy added that it didn’t communicate instructions well with customers.

  6:26 a.m. ET, March 27, 2020 Communications issue prevented UK from joining EU ventilator scheme From CNN's Sarah Dean in London The UK did not take part in the EU’s scheme to acquire extra ventilators during the coronavirus pandemic because of an “issue in terms of communication,” according to UK Business Minister Alok Sharma. Responding to British media reports, Sharma told the BBC’s Radio 4 on Friday:  The tendering process on those schemes had already started… If there are future schemes we will absolutely look to see if we will be joining them.”

  He said the UK has its own “ventilator challenge,” which has seen around 3,000 companies respond with offers to help.  On Wednesday, James Dyson, the founder of British technology company Dyson, confirmed to employees in a letter shared with CNN that it had received an order from the UK government for  10,000 new ventilators  to support efforts by the NHS to treat the growing number of patients who have contracted coronavirus.

  Asked about Dyson-produced ventilators being in use by next month, Sharma said Dyson or any other company will need to meet the regulatory requirements before newly acquired ventilators are put into use in the National Health Service (NHS). Pressed on the timescale, Sharma said: “What we want to see is prototypes coming forward in a matter of weeks before we move into large scale production.” He said although the government is trying to move at pace, “the critical point is to make sure that any machines that come forward actually meet the requirements and are safe”.
