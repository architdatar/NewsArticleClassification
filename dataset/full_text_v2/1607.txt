  Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin informed President Vladimir Putin that he had tested positive for coronavirus during a video conference on Thursday evening, according to a Kremlin transcript of their conversation.   
  "It has just became known that the tests I took for coronavirus have given a positive result," Mishutin said, adding that he "must observe self-isolation as the doctors order."  
  He said that planned to stay in contact with his colleagues by phone and videocall. 
  Putin then wished Mishustin a speedy recovery.
