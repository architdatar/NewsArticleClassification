  Spain's San Fermin bull run has been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, Pamplona's town hall announced Tuesday. 
  The town's deputy mayor Ana Elizalde said in a news conference that although the cancellation was "expected" it still "leaves us all sad."
  The bull-running festival has only been canceled four other times; in 1937 and 1938 for the Spanish civil war, in 1978 following clashes between police and Basque nationalists, and in 1997 after the assassination of a Spanish politician by the ETA separatist group.
