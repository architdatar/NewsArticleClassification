  USA Gymnastics is postponing all "premier events" until 2021 because of the coronavirus epidemic.
  The GK U.S. Classic, which had been scheduled for May 23, will now be May 22, 2021, and the U.S. Gymnastics Championships which were to start on June 4 will be rescheduled for June 3, 2021,  the organization said  Tuesday.
  "In light of recent guidance from health experts, and after receiving feedback from our athletes and coaches, we believe it is in the best interest of our community to wait until 2021 to hold premier events,” said Li Li Leung, USA Gymnastics' president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
  The Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games which had been scheduled for this summer have  previously been postponed  until next summer.
