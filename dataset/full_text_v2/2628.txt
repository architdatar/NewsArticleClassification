  New data obtained by NBC News provide a sobering picture of the massive scale of the N95 mask shortage.
  For the last several years, annual U.S. demand for N95 medical masks was around 25 million, according to Chaun Powell, Vice President of Preparedness and Response for Premier, a hospital group purchasing organization.
  But Powell said that in just the first three months of 2020, total demand has already hit 136 million — more than 20 times higher than the typical rate, calculated on a monthly basis.
  Vizient, another hospital group purchasing organization, told NBC News its client hospitals are burning through a year’s supply of N95 masks in a month.
  Mask manufacturers are attempting to meet the need, but those efforts are unlikely to match the pace of the coronavirus outbreak. The largest N95 mask manufacturer, 3M, has ramped up domestic production to 35 million a month, but that won’t even cover the demand in March. And there's every reason to believe that need will grow in the weeks ahead.
  Hospitals, public health officials and suppliers are scrambling for alternatives. The FDA's decision to lower standards on which masks can be used in a medical setting are a start, Powell said.
  “We’re moving in the right direction,” he said, but he says the demand “if anything, is artificially low.”
