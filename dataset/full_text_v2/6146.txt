  Texas’ ban on abortions  prompted by the coronavirus pandemic has ended, and clinics said they were resuming services.
  State lawyers on Wednesday said that less restrictive health care rules were in effect. In a filing in the U.S. Western District Court of Texas, the lawyers cited an  executive order Gov. Greg Abbott issued last week  that said health care facilities could remain open if they reserved a quarter of their beds for COVID-19 patients and didn’t request personal protective equipment from the government.
  “There is no case or controversy remaining,” the lawyers said.
  Texas' Attorney General Ken Paxton last month had sought to halt all abortions that were not "immediately medically necessary," citing the need to preserve medical resources to coronavirus patients. 
  The order was challenged in court, and one of the Southwestern Women’s Surgery Center, of Dallas, said on its website Wednesday that it had resumed scheduling all services. Amy Hagstrom Miller, CEO of another plaintiff, Whole Woman’s Health clinics, told the  Dallas Morning News  that the order allows abortion providers to “resume both medication and procedural abortions.”
