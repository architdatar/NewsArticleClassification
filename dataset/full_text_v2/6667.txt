  The World Health Organization  said yesterday  that coronavirus cases outside China were accelerating. Around 80,000 people in nearly 40 countries have been infected, and at least 2,600 have died.
  Draconian measures in China have slowed the spread   there , the W.H.O. noted, but the outbreak could prove hard to contain elsewhere. Most health experts are worried about Iran, Italy and South Korea. Japanese officials said today that the country, which has more than 800 confirmed cases, was  at a “crossroads”  in fighting the outbreak.
  If other countries followed China’s “bold approach,”  as the W.H.O. put it, widespread quarantines and other restrictions would hit the global economy hard.  This fear  was partially responsible for yesterday’s tumultuous markets, as investors hedged their portfolios, businesses revised their forecasts, and officials prepared for the worst.
  Behind the scenes:  The  coronavirus live briefing  on the NYT website has been  running for 34 days  and has been viewed more than 50 million times, half of those from readers outside the U.S.
  Global stocks fell sharply yesterday, with the S&P 500 suffering its  worst single decline in two years . In just one day, the benchmark index gave up all its gains for the year. Every major sector fell.
  Until now, investors viewed the virus outbreak “like a minor traffic jam,”   according to the economist Megan Greene : “Disruptive but, in economic and financial terms, something you get past quickly.” Indeed, a recent survey of fund managers by Bank of America found that those investors were holding their lowest cash balances since 2013.
  No longer.  Stock investors are  starting to price in  the risk of a potential pandemic. Bond investors have been worried for some time, pushing long-term yields to  historic lows .
  Bucking the trend , the usual havens like  U.S. Treasuries ,  the dollar  and  gold  performed well. And if you’re brave enough to trade things linked to the VIX volatility index, the sharp, sudden lurch in trading  has been a winner .
  Why are investors reacting now?  Our colleague Matt Phillips shares his thoughts:
  U.S. stocks are set to open up slightly today , although European shares also started in the green before slipping into the red.  Traders say  they aren’t in “sell everything” mode — even if what passes for optimism these days are calls like those from Blackstone’s Byron Wien, who recently said, “ I don’t think it’s the end of the world .”
  Profit warnings from companies are piling up, as the outbreak’s  impact on supply chains  and consumer spending takes its toll.
  United Airlines abandoned its earnings guidance for 2020 , saying “the range of possible scenarios is too wide” to provide a sensible forecast. With some understatement, it said demand for flights to China was down “ approximately 100 percent .”
  Expectations for a Fed rate cut (or two) are rising , although  central bank officials are reluctant  to factor epidemiology into their forecasts for the U.S. economy. For their part, Goldman Sachs economists cut their estimate of first-quarter G.D.P. growth to  just above 1 percent , saying the risks are “clearly skewed to the downside.”
  Falling markets and weaker growth could be a threat  to President Trump’s re-election chances, a source of  consternation inside the White House . The president  tweeted yesterday  that the virus was under control in the U.S., and the drop in stocks meant the market was “starting to look very good to me!” The White House’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow,  added that  investors should “seriously consider buying these dips.”
  A Manhattan jury  convicted Harvey Weinstein  yesterday of two counts of two felony sex crimes but acquitted him of charges of being a sexual predator. No matter:  It was a big moment  in holding powerful men accountable in a court of law.
  A reminder of how the case  reshaped the corporate world , according to Rebecca Greenfield of Bloomberg:
  The main selling point of private equity is that, despite hefty fees, it outperforms the stock market. Bain & Company’s  latest report on the industry  challenges this pitch.
  U.S. buyout funds’ returns have essentially matched  U.S. stock markets over the past 10 years. Returns over longer periods have been better for private equity, but investors may rightfully ask: What have you done for me lately? “Parity with public markets is not what PE investors are paying for,” Bain writes. (In light of these findings, the big annual industry confab that starts today in Berlin, known as  SuperReturn , might not live up to its branding.)
  The future isn’t looking much brighter.  “If you draw a trend line between the 10-year return in 1999 and the 10-year return today, it would show a decline of 6 percentage points over that period,” the study’s authors add.
  • The sheer amount of uninvested capital — some $1.5 trillion in so-called dry powder — is driving up prices for deals, eroding funds’ performance.
  • The only sure winners, the report predicts, are sector experts — think Silver Lake for tech or L Catterton for consumer — or mega-firms like Blackstone and KKR.
  On CNBC yesterday,  Warren Buffett told Andrew  he would “have no trouble voting for Mike Bloomberg,” though he cautioned that support from a fellow billionaire might not help Mr. Bloomberg win the Democratic presidential nomination.
  On buying Bloomberg’s company  if the eponymous founder became president, Mr. Buffett — whose Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on $128 billion in cash and loves cash-rich companies with fat profit margins —  didn’t mince words :
  We threw out some names of potential Bloomberg buyers , including Mr. Buffett, in the newsletter  last week  ... but that was before  Mr. Bloomberg’s    debate debut .
  Fun fact:  Mr. Buffett has finally  traded in his flip phone  for an iPhone, a sign of brand allegiance (in addition, of course, to his company’s $74 billion stake in Apple).
