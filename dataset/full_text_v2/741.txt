  A baby born Jan. 15 has tested  positive for coronavirus  in South Korea, making him perhaps the youngest patient to be infected with the disease.
  Both of his parents also tested positive for coronavirus, the infection that causes COVID-19.  
  The baby and his mother are in stable condition, South Korean public health officials said. The two have been quarantined in their home instead of being hospitalized because of the baby's age.
  The father's condition was not immediately clear. 
  Based on a small study of women in China that was published in early February, there is currently no evidence the  virus is transmitted  before birth from a mother who was infected late in pregnancy.
