  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday he has asked major sports teams to begin planning to play without fans.Â 
  "New York state will help those major sport franchises to do just that," Cuomo said at his daily press briefing. "Hockey, basketball, baseball, football, whoever can reopen, we're a ready, willing and able partner."
