  President Trump said in a FEMA briefing Thursday that he will likely survey the damage from Hurricane Laura over the weekend.
  Trump said he considered delaying his acceptance speech at the RNC on Thursday evening, depending on the severity of the storm, but will go forward with the original convention plans.
  â€œIt turned out we got a little bit lucky," Trump said. "It was very big, it was very powerful, but it passed quickly, so everything is on schedule."
