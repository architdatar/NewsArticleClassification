  The  Cape Cod Baseball League , a famed training ground for future professional players, canceled its 2020 season because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials announced Friday.
  The league said  it "would be impossible to guarantee the safety of players, coaches, umpires, host families, volunteers and fans during this unprecedented health crisis." 
  Every summer , the 10-team Massachusetts league invites the nation's best college players to compete with wood bats, providing scouts a key glimpse at their pro potential.  Opening day had been  set for June 13.
