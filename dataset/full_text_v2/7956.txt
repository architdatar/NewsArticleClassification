  A top U.S. scientist behind groundbreaking research in cancer and HIV/AIDS warned that a vaccine for the  coronavirus  may never be found, as the number of global COVID-19 infections surged past 5 million on Thursday.
  William Haseltine, who has also worked on human genome projects, said that while a COVID-19 vaccine could be developed, “I wouldn’t count on it.” Instead, he told Reuters, countries beginning to reverse lockdown measures need to lean on careful tracing of infections and strict isolation measures to control the spread.
  Such an approach has proved successful in some countries that have minimized the spread, but worldwide, the numbers continue to climb. More than 328,000 people have died due to the virus while 5,001,494 have been infected, according to Johns Hopkins University as of Thursday morning.
