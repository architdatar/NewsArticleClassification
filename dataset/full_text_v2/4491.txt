  Several more drug manufacturers have joined the global effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine.
  The announcements, from Merck and Novartis, follow earlier initiatives by pharmaceutical companies  Moderna  and  Inovio , as well as from the United Kingdom's  Oxford University .

  "I really think a vaccine is probably a 2021 event, in terms of having wide availability of a vaccine for the general population."
