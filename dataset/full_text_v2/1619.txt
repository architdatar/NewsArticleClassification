  South Korea reported 39 new cases on Saturday — most of them recorded in the densely populated Seoul area where officials have linked scores of infections to warehouse workers. 
  Health officials said Friday that at least 102 infections had been linked to workers at a massive warehouse operated by Coupang — a local e-commerce giant that has seen orders spike during the epidemic. 
  The company has been criticized for failing to implement proper preventive measures and enforce distance between employees, as the virus was discovered on safety helmets, laptops, keyboards and other equipment they share. The resurgence in infections has alarmed officials as millions of students have been  returning to school  nationwide.
  Figures from South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought national totals to 11,441 confirmed cases and 269 deaths.
