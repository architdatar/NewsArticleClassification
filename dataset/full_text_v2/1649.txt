  Tokyo set in place further restrictions on Friday, as part of its battle to stem the spread of  coronavirus .
  Theaters, sports facilities and places of assembly will be closed, while bars and restaurants will have limited opening times, governor Yuriko Koike told a press conference. The measures are part of the country's ongoing month-long state of emergency announced April 7.
  "From our point of view, this is a matter of life and death for Tokyoites," said Koike. "We’ve been receiving reports on a daily basis that the medical capacity of the city is getting stretched thin." 
  Tokyo's lockdown is not compulsory but rather requests the public to refrain from leaving their homes.
