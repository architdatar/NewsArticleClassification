  The red carpet was rolled out for a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor who recently recovered from COVID-19. 
  Jack Holzberg, from Forest Hills, a neighborhood in New York City's Queens borough, was discharged from  CareOne at Hanover , a rehab center in New Jersey, on Tuesday after he spent weeks fighting the deadly virus.
  “He’s just one of the toughest people that I know,” Holzberg’s grandson-in-law Jeff Wasserman  told NBC New York . 
  The great grandfather of five has been a fighter his whole life. As a teenager, Holzberg survived multiple concentration camps in Austria and Poland, according to  testimony  he gave to the USC Shoah Foundation Institute in 1996.
  In a post on Facebook, Holzberg’s granddaughter Erica Wasserman expressed her gratitude for her grandfather’s health care team. “As a Holocaust survivor, he personifies strength and positivity. We are beyond grateful to everyone who cared for him and we can’t wait for the day when we can all celebrate together,”  Wasserman wrote .
