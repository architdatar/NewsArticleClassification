  Arnold Schwarzenegger reassured Norwegians on Sunday that their national celebrations will eventually "be back" as the country held a socially distanced Constitution Day holiday. 
  "We must live with limitations, rules and measures in order to take back the holiday as we know it," said Prime Minister Erne Solberg in a video address posted on Facebook, referring to the cancellation of traditional festivities that celebrate the signing of the country's constitution in 1814.
  "For that reason, I have a message from someone who is very good at taking things back," teased Solberg. 
  Wearing a stetson and sitting next to an American flag, Schwarzenegger reassured the Norwegian public that children's parades, sack races and everything they loved about their national day "will all be back" as long as they obeyed social distancing and remembered to wash their hands. 
  Schwarzenegger, born in Austria, is known for his "Terminator" movies and as a former governor of California.
