  Videos and photos circulating online Tuesday night show long lines wrapping down hallways and staircases in various polling locations as young voters waited for hours to cast their ballots in Michigan cities like Kalamazoo, Ann Arbor and East Lansing.
  Colin Sherrod, 21, a college student at Michigan State University, waited over more than two hours to cast his ballot for Bernie Sanders. He registered on Tuesday and believes that’s one of the reasons why the voting lines seem excessively long.
  "I think the main issue was because so many people tried to register on the same day. I’ve heard that wait time grew to four hours after I left," he told NBC News.
  Officials in Ann Arbor also blamed same-day registered for the long lines.
  "Ann Arbor has no waiting for people who are registered. Same-day voter registration, and everyone who isn’t registered, have been coming to the Clerk's Office,” City Clerk Jacqueline Beaudry said. "We have registered to close 1,000 people. This is the first time we have implemented this."
  Michigan State University College Democrats told NBC News that polling stations were ill-prepared to deal with the amount of students that turned up to vote and information about how to register wasn’t communicated well. 
  "Student groups on campus are trying to keep voters in line by having food and drinks at the polls to keep people spirits up and make sure they vote," the group said in a statement.
