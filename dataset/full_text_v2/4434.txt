  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called on President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans to provide greater help to the city in  any new federal stimulus funding . 
  Trump needs to "step up" to help protect his home town, de Blasio said during a press conference Sunday. 
  "My question is, Mr. President, are you going to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead?"  
  New York City's numbers in the past 24 hours were a mixed bag, according to the mayor.
  While coronavirus admissions to hospitals went up from 261 to 317, the number of patients in intensive care units went down. The number of positive test results also went down citywide, from 42 percent to 38 percent.
