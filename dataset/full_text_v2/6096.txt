  Organizers for the South by Southwest annual conference, which was  canceled  by Austin officials over coronavirus fears, said Monday that they had let go of about one-third of its full-time staff.
  "Due to the City of Austin’s unprecedented and unexpected cancellation of the SXSW 2020 events in March, SXSW has been rigorously reviewing our operations, and we are in the unimaginable position of reducing our workforce. Today we said goodbye to approximately one-third of our full-time staff," a spokesperson for South by Southwest, commonly known as SXSW, said.
  "Those of us in the business of live events know the level of trust required to execute an event of SXSW’s scale, and we are deeply sad to let people go this soon. We are planning for the future and this was a necessary, but heartbreaking step," the spokesperson said.
  Austin's mayor on Friday declared a state of emergency, which resulted in the cancellation.
