  6:16 p.m. ET, May 24, 2020 The White House announced new travel restrictions on Brazil From CNN's Jason Hoffman President Donald Trump on Sunday issued a proclamation suspending entry to the US for any individual who has been in Brazil within the 14 days immediately prior to their arrival.  "I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the Federative Republic of Brazil during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States," the proclamation reads in part.

  The policy is aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus. As of Sunday evening, Brazil had more than 347,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the second most worldwide,  according to data from Johns Hopkins University . "Today's action will help ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country," White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Sunday. "These new restrictions do not apply to the flow of commerce between the United States and Brazil."  
  Some context:  Coronavirus has yet to peak in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest and worst-infected city, but the health care system is already beginning to break down.  As the crisis deepens and the number of deaths continues to rise, President Jair Bolsonaro is urging businesses to reopen. He opposes many governors who are stressing social distancing measures to slow the spread. Far from hospitals, Brazil's indigenous people are dying at an alarming rate. The death toll is double that of the rest of Brazil's population, according to the advocacy group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil.

  Dublin Deck Tiki Bar and Grill in Patchogue, New York, apologized on Sunday after Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office criticized the restaurant for allegedly easing restrictions on masks and social distancing for its customers because of rainy weather on Friday. “From what I understand, it was raining on Friday evening and so the bar allowed patrons to come inside to pick up their food,” said Melissa DeRosa, secretary to the governor, adding that was the explanation given to Suffolk County police, who broke up the crowd. Restaurants in New York state are currently limited to take-out and delivery. Photos from inside the bar at the time showed people not wearing masks, DeRosa said. “That’s stupid -- stupid for you, it’s stupid for your surrounding patrons, it’s stupid for the bar,” she said. “I take them at their word that that’s what happened, but moving forward, they should be on notice and again, the enforcement is up to the locals.” The restaurant later posted an apology on its  Instagram story , saying “quick rainfall sent guests inside to the bar area.” “There are no excuses when it comes to public safety. We should not have allowed anybody inside whatsoever,” the statement said.  "We apologize to anybody who may have been offended by the videos that surfaced," it said. The Suffolk County Police Department confirmed it responded after "multiple 911 calls" regarding noncompliance at the restaurant. The department is "taking reports of noncompliance very seriously," it said in a statement.

  1:58 p.m. ET, May 24, 2020 FDA commissioner issues Memorial Day warning: "Coronavirus is not yet contained" From CNN's Devan Cole FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn speaks at a coronavirus task force briefing on April 4. Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images 
  The commissioner of the  US Food and Drug Administration on Sunday  urged Americans observing Memorial Day weekend to follow federal guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus, saying the deadly virus "is not yet contained." "With the country starting to open up this holiday weekend, I again remind everyone that the coronavirus is not yet contained. It is up to every individual to protect themselves and their community. Social distancing, hand washing and wearing masks protect us all," Dr. Stephen Hahn wrote in a tweet. 
  Some context:  The commissioner's Memorial Day warning comes as some states begin to reopen, allowing people to go to beaches, cookouts and bars as they observe one of the more popular holidays that's to take place amid the pandemic. But as social activities increase, health experts like Hahn warn the US is still not out of the woods. "Even as states and some state officials rush to reopen it's on us to make smart and safe decisions," Dr. Seema Yasmin, a former disease detective at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN Saturday night. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told the public last week that going outside was fine, with cautious measures. "Go out, wear a mask, stay 6 feet away from anyone so you can have the physical distancing," he told a CNN coronavirus town hall. "Go for a run. Go for a walk. Go fishing. As long as you're not in a crowd and you're not in a situation where you can physically transmit the virus."

  South Africa will reopen the majority of its economy starting June 1, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced during a televised address to the nation on Sunday evening. Most sectors will open under new level three regulations, but with strict observance of social distancing and health safety measures.  The national borders will remain closed and flights will continue to be grounded, except for cargo. Schools will begin a phased reopening, with grades 7 and 12 beginning on June 1. All public universities will be expected to begin remote teaching. The nation’s coronavirus-related alcohol ban will be lifted for home consumption, but its ban on cigarettes continues under level three. “We are in much better position than many other countries at this stage in the progression of the disease,” Ramaphosa said. 
  Some context:  South Africa has conducted close to 600,000 coronavirus tests and more than 12 million screenings thanks to an army of around 60,000 public health workers deployed at the start of the country’s outbreak.  Ramaphosa admitted that one third of South Africa’s cumulative cases occurred in the last week alone, adding that modeling shows that “the coronavirus pandemic is going to get much worse before it gets better.” “We have known all along that the lockdown would only delay the spread of the virus, but it would not be able to stop it,” said Ramaphosa.
