  Green Day, Fall Out Boy and Weezer are postponing their summer tours until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, joining a growing list of artists that have put their plans on hold.
  "Hopefully this doesn't come as too much of a surprise, but as much as we were looking forward to seeing you all this summer, everyone's safety is our highest priority," the artists  wrote  in a joint post on Green Day's Twitter account on Tuesday. 
  Reba McEntire also announced that she will be rescheduling her upcoming arena tour, which was slated to start in July.
  “I can’t wait to see everybody when we know it’s safe to gather again,” McEntire wrote in a statement. “We’ve worked so hard on this new show and I’ll be ready to go as soon as we get the green light!”
  Ticketholders for both tours will have the option to transfer their tickets to a summer 2021 concert date or receive a refund.
