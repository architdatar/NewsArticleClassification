On a day the pope celebrated an Easter Mass in solitude and  most churches in the U.S. canceled in-person services , the world saw some good news in its attempt to slow the impact of the coronavirus.
  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, one of the most  high-profile people in the political world to become infected with COVID-19 , was released from the hospital Sunday, while reported deaths in America due to the virus dropped for the second consecutive day, according to  data compiled by Johns Hopkins University . 
  The Internal Revenue Service also  announced  the  first stimulus payments meant to ease economic fallout of the pandemic  had been deposited into taxpayers’ bank accounts as many  businesses are closed .
  President Donald Trump had previously set what he later described as an "aspirational" goal to reopen the country by Sunday but has since extended social distancing guidelines to the end of the month.
  "Though we will not be able to gather together with one another as we normally would on Easter ... I ask all Americans to pray that god will heal our nation,"  Trump said in an Easter message .
  As of Sunday evening, the U.S. had more than 555,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 22,000 deaths. Worldwide, there are at least 1.8 million cases and 114,000 deaths, according to  data compiled by Johns Hopkins University . At least 421,000 people have recovered worldwide.

  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson  was discharged from the hospital where he was being treated for the coronavirus, his office said in a statement Sunday. 
  Johnson 55, will continue his recovery at Chequers, a 16th-century manor house in the English countryside that is the prime minister's official vacation retreat. 
  “On the advice of his medical team, (the prime minister) will not be immediately returning to work," No. 10 Downing Street's statement said. "He wishes to thank everybody at St Thomas’ (hospital) for the brilliant care he has received."
  Johnson was diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 26 and still had a cough and fever 10 days later. He was admitted to the hospital a week ago and spent three days in intensive care.
  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is standing in for Johnson while he is sick.

  The cobblestone piazza of St. Peter’s Square was empty Sunday as  Pope Francis celebrated Easter Mass in solitude  inside the basilica in Italy.
  It was an unusual scene on the holiest day of the Christian calendar,  one that will likely be repeated in churches  all over the U.S. as  states are cracking down on religious gatherings  to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.
  During his traditional Easter address, broadcast online, Francis called for political leaders to give hope and opportunity to laid-off workers, asking specifically for sanctions relief, debt forgiveness and cease-fires,  according to the Associated Press .
  Meanwhile, churches in the U.S. are holding similar remote services. Congregants posted photos on social media showing them attending drive-in services from their cars, and a pastor at  a Boston church delivered his message  to photos of his parishioners taped to the pews.
  Some, however, have not followed stay-at-home orders. In Kentucky,  state troopers recorded  the license plates of congregants ignoring a state order and worshipping in a large group.
  At  another church in Kentucky,  pastor Jack Roberts reported that someone scattered piles of nails around the church's parking lot in the hours before in-person services were set to begin. Roberts held a service Wednesday that drew 40 people – and a health department order to stop holding such gatherings.
  Roberts was insistent on holding service Sunday, arguing his parishioners have a constitutional right to worship together, and covered up his license plate.

  In an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Dr. Anthony Fauci said reopening the country was "not going to be a light switch" and would depend on the severity of the outbreak in different areas.
  "You want to make sure you don't do something prematurely and precipitously, but at the same time you pay attention to the need to try to get back to normal," he said.
  "It is not going to be a light switch," he explained, noting the severity of the pandemic varied throughout out the country.
  "I think it's going to have to be something that is not one size fits all," he said. Fauci hoped by the end of April, some parts of the country be ready to start "pulling back," but if they weren't, social distancing recommendations would remain in place.

  Famed opera singer Andrea Bocelli  lent his voice to millions for Easter Sunday, singing live from the historic Duomo cathedral in Milan  via his YouTube channel .
  “On the day in which we celebrate the trust in a life that triumphs, I’m honored and happy to answer ‘Sì’ to the invitation of the city and the Duomo of Milan,” Bocelli said in a statement.
  Though not a church service, Bocelli said he hopes the concert, called "Music for Hope," brings viewers together to "hug this wounded Earth's pulsing heart."
  Bocelli  sang a special set for the event , including "Amazing Grace" and holy songs like “Ave Maria” and “Sancta Maria.” 
  President Donald Trump is set to  announce a new task force Tuesday  that will focus solely on whether the administration should extend federal social distancing guidelines past May 1 or attempt to reopen parts of the country to blunt the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.
  As U.S. unemployment claims soar and businesses are hurt by the impact of social distancing, the president has indicated a desire to ease guidelines in less hard hit states. Trump has acknowledged he must balance that goal against fears of reigniting hot spots or creating new ones. 
  But there is also the question of if the president or the states will ultimately be the responsible for the decision. Experts say governors may be influenced by the Trump administration, but whether to lift stay-at-home orders and open schools will ultimately be theirs to make.

  Following  weeks of uncertainty , the IRS announced Saturday that the first stimulus payments of up to $1,200 had been deposited into eligible taxpayers' bank accounts.
  "#IRS deposited the first Economic Impact Payments into taxpayers’ bank accounts today. We know many people are anxious to get their payments; we’ll continue issuing them as fast as we can," according to a Saturday tweet.
  Eligible taxpayers who filed tax returns for either 2019 or 2018 and chose direct deposit for their refund will automatically receive a stimulus payment of up to $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for married couples and $500 for each qualifying child, the IRS said. 
  Individuals who receive Social Security retirement or disability benefits or who receive Railroad Retirement benefits but didn’t file a return for 2019 or 2018 will automatically receive a payment in the “near future,” the agency said.
  The government is prioritizing the first few waves of payments in the coming weeks toward low-income Americans and Social Security beneficiaries, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant at TurboTax.
  Some Americans were confused following conflicting reports from different corners of the government in recent weeks. The IRS said at the end of March stimulus payments would start being distributed within three weeks.

  As unemployment numbers  continue to rise because of the coronavirus pandemic , Americans' perceptions of the economy are worsening and almost a quarter say they've had difficulty paying rent or their mortgage, according to a new survey.
  Sixty-five percent of Americans believe the economy is getting worse – a 40 percentage point jump from four weeks earlier, when only 25% believed it was getting worse, according to the  Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project  with USA TODAY.
  In the four weeks between surveys, the economy ground to a near-halt as much of the country was put under stay-at-home orders and non-essential businesses were forced to close. Since then, millions of people have been laid off or furloughed. The Labor Department reported Thursday that about 6.6 million Americans filed unemployment benefit claims for the first time last week, bringing the three-week total to more than 17 million.
  Amid the economic turmoil, Americans also are having difficulty paying bills such as student loans or car payments. Those surveyed are also showing an increase in loss of income and job losses compared to roughly this same time two years ago.

  Consumer buying habits are going through a variety of stages as the country adjusts to life under lockdown, and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon says it’s clear many people are now in need of a haircut.
  McMillon  told the "Today Show"  that paper goods and hand sanitizer are continuing to sell out, with the retailer selling enough toilet paper in less than a week for every American to “have their own roll,” he said.
  Those products were a part of buyers' first wave of purchases as the nation adjusted to widespread lockdowns and social distancing restrictions. Next, McMillon said Walmart saw a spike in puzzle and game purchases.
  Now, other types of essentials are seeing a surge of interest: “Lately, we’ve seen more grooming products. People are starting to need a haircut, so you’re starting to see more beard trimmers and hair color and things like that.”
  Another sign that consumers are paying attention to their appearance:  An uptick in use of photo editing programs .

  Florida's largest advocacy group for long-term care providers is  requesting protection from lawsuits for health care professionals  engaged in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak.
  The Florida Health Care Association sent a letter to Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this month requesting "immunity from any liability, civil or criminal" under certain conditions for nursing homes, hospitals and other facilities.
  The group is the most recent in a series of health care associations seeking legal immunity amid the pandemic, when hours are long and staffing and equipment are short.
  Brian Lee, executive director of Families For Better Care, a non-profit group advocating for nursing home residents, said the letter was the equivalent of "asking for forgiveness in advance."
  A recent  USA TODAY analysis of federal inspection data  found that a majority of U.S. nursing homes (75%) have been cited for failing to properly monitor and control infections in the last three years – a higher proportion than previously known.
