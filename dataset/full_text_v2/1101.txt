He tweeted: “CDC tracks 12 different forecasting models of possible  #COVID19  deaths in the US. As of May 11, all forecast an increase in deaths in the coming weeks and a cumulative total exceeding 100,000 by June 1.” His tweet comes after researchers at the University of Washington revised the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model on Tuesday — often cited by the White House — upward to 147,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States by August 4. As of 5:40 p.m. ET on Friday, Johns Hopkins University counts 87,184 coronavirus deaths in the United States.

  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said today that sports are not over, but watching the games on television may last a while.  "I think we are going to be a new normal for quite a while," the governor said. "People can watch the games on television, not in person. That may have to be how we operate for a while." 
  Whitmer also stressed the "need a vaccine." "And we need to have mass quantities available, or we need to be able to test and acknowledge that we've got some immunity that's built up. We're not there yet," she said. The governor said the organizers of leagues understand how important it is to act responsibly.  "We can have sports, just the way we observe them may look a little different," Whitmer added.  The governor also addressed recent threats against her, saying, "It is never acceptable to make threats of violence to anyone, but our officeholders as well. And so we take them very seriously." "I've never felt unsafe because I know that the State Police is a serious organization that is incredibly professional and has got my safety at the center of some of the work that they do," Whitmer added.  By the numbers:  Michigan has a total of 50,079 Covid-19 cases and 4,825 deaths.

  5:39 p.m. ET, May 15, 2020 New Mexico governor says retailers and houses of worship can operate at 25% capacity From CNN's Hollie Silverman  All retailers in New Mexico — with the exception of those in three counties — can operate at 25% of their fire code capacity starting Saturday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Friday. Cibola, McKinley and San Juan counties are not included in the new guidance because case counts are still too high in that region, Lujan Grisham said. Retailers are considered any business that sells good directly to the consumer. Entertainment venues, such as movie theaters, concert halls and amusement parks, are not considered retail businesses, Lujan Grisham said. Houses of worship are also allowed to operate at 25% capacity, she said. Other nonessential businesses, such as office spaces and call centers, can also operate with 25% of pre-crisis staffing levels, according to the new guidance.

  Cases of coronavirus are still "too high" in New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said during a Friday news conference. Lujan Grisham said that she will "do whatever it takes" to protect vulnerable communities from increased spread.  She warned that another shutdown could be possible if people don't work to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.  "On my way here...I saw far too much non-social distancing by far too many New Mexicans," the governor said. 
  There are 223 people who are hospitalized with coronavirus and 49 of them are on ventilators, Lujan Grisham said. So far, 253 people have died in New Mexico from coronavirus, Lujan Grisham added.

  5:28 p.m. ET, May 15, 2020 Health expert explains why Covid-19 is worse than flu From CNN Health’s Maggie Fox The coronavirus is nothing like the flu, and continued comparisons are misleading, a senior American Heart Association official said Friday. Covid-19 is new, people have no immunity to it, there’s no vaccine to prevent it and no good treatment for infection, Dr. Eduardo Sanchez said in a commentary on the American Heart Association website. Plus, the new coronavirus is more dangerous in several ways, Sanchez said. “Covid-19 seems to be more contagious,” he wrote. “Both diseases spread from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when a sick person coughs or sneezes,” he added. “Available information suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is spreading more efficiently than influenza. It spreads easily and sustainably, meaning that it goes from person to person without stopping.” 
  And despite constant references to how many people are killed by seasonal influenza every year, Covid-19 has killed more people, faster, said Sanchez, who is chief of the American Heart Association’s Center for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) estimates that 24,000 to 62,000 flu deaths occurred during the 2019-2020 flu season (October 1, 2019 through April 4, 2020). This is a wide range because flu is not a reportable disease in most areas of the country, and the estimate is derived from a mathematical model based on flu-associated hospitalizations,” he wrote. Covid-19 deaths are counted one by one, Sanchez noted. More than 86,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University, and they have died in the span of just three months. “Our understanding of the virus is rapidly evolving, but so far, COVID-19 appears to pose a greater risk to the public’s health than the flu,” Sanchez said.

  4:53 p.m. ET, May 15, 2020 Nurse tells Trump the reason she hasn't caught coronavirus is because of protective equipment From CNN's Nikki Carvajal  Nurse Amy Ford answers a question from President Donald Trump during a presidential recognition ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House, on Friday, May 15, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP 
  At a ceremony honoring "the hard work, heroism, and hope that Americans from all walks of life have exemplified during the Covid-19 pandemic" this afternoon, President Trump asked a nurse how she was able to avoid catching coronavirus.  The nurse, Amy Ford, thought it was because of personal protective equipment. Ford is a nurse from West Virginia who is working in New York City during the pandemic. She described holding a phone up to her patients so they could hear from family they weren't able to see in person.  She called it one of the "most emotionally challenging things" she'd ever been through.
