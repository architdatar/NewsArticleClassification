  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that several local manufacturers will be able to produce hundreds of thousands of face shields per week.
  "We will no longer be at the whims of the federal government," de Blasio said at a morning news conference.
  De Blasio said that the manufacturers will be able to make at least 240,000 face shields per week.
  He also said the city had taken measures to increase the supply of medical gowns.
