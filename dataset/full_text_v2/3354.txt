  A bar in Tybee Island, Georgia, is donating thousands of dollars from its own walls to employees who are out of work because of the coronavirus. It took Jennifer Knox and a team of volunteers three-and-a-half days to strip the walls of her restaurant, The Sand Bar, of $3,714 in dollar bills.
  She then distributed the cash to four bartenders and two musicians who were out of work. Knox said her pub, which has a small staff of six people, is known as “the smallest bar with the biggest heart.” 
  “The people on this island rely on tourism and this is our season,” Knox said. “I just want to save the island.”
  Since  posting about her endeavor on , Knox said she has received more than $2,000 in additional donations, which she plans to continue distributing to her community.
