  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump issued an executive order Friday giving the Department of Defense and Homeland Security the authority to activate the ready reserve components of the armed forces to help in the response to the coronavirus outbreak. 
  “This will allow us to mobilize medical disaster emergency response personnel to help wage our battle against the virus,” Trump said at a press conference Friday evening. “We have a lot of people, retirees, great military people, they're coming back in.”
  The Pentagon is currently reviewing how many of the 1 million ready reserve members will be activated in response to Trump’s executive order.
