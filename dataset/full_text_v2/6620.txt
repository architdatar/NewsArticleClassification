"We are very concerned about Haiti at the moment because of its unique circumstances, unique fragility and the fact that the disease is accelerating in a highly vulnerable population", WHO's Executive Director for Health Emergencies, Michael Ryan, said in a press conference. 
  "What has been common to many regions has been intense community transmission and it is clear that once community transmission has been established it's very difficult to root the virus out."

  8:31 p.m. ET, June 3, 2020 Brazil will be first country outside UK to test vaccine developed by Oxford University  From CNN’s Shasta Darlington, Mia Alberti and Rodrigo Pedroso Two thousand Brazilians will participate in June tests of a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University in partnership with AstraZeneca pharmaceutical, the Federal University of Sao Paulo (Unifesp) said in a statement. On Tuesday, the Brazilian Ministry of Health approved the start of the study, in which 1,000 patients in São Paulo and 1,000 more in Rio de Janeiro will be vaccinated. The country is the first site of these vaccination tests outside the United Kingdom. The study will happen as Brazil is registering an increase in the number of cases and deaths. Tuesday's reported death toll of 1,262 was a record for a 24-hour period. Brazil's biggest cities have still started relaxing social isolation rules imposed since mid-March. “The most important thing is to carry out this stage of the study now when the epidemiological curve is still rising and the results may be more assertive", the lead investigator of the study in Brazil and Unifesp researcher, Lily Yin Weckx, said.   
  The official registration of the vaccine is expected to be made later this year in the United Kingdom, Unifesp said in its statement. Brazil has the second-highest number of cases after the United States.
