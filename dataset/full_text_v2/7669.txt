  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he plans to visit Arizona next week and potentially Ohio "very soon," marking one of the few times the president has left the White House in several weeks amid the  coronavirus  pandemic.
  "I think I’m going to Arizona next week, and we look forward to that," Trump said during a roundtable event with business leaders at the White House.
  Trump, has rarely left the White House amid the outbreak, said that the purpose of his visit to Arizona was "industry" related because it was "too soon for the big, for the big everybody get-together-and-stand-next-to-each other crowds."
  Trump’s last campaign rally was March 2 in North Carolina and spent the following weekend at his Florida resort where he met with the  president of Brazil . Since then, his only public appearance outside the White House was on March 28 when  he traveled to Norfolk, Va.  to see off the USNS Comfort hospital ship as it made its way to New York.
