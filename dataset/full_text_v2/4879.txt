  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Thursday detailed plans to develop a massive program for tracing the contacts of people in the state who test positive for coronavirus. 
  Cuomo said the effort will require hiring between 6,400 and 17,000 contact tracers, depending on the spread of the virus.
  Bloomberg, whose philanthropic organization is helping to lead the program's launch, joined Cuomo via video during the governor's daily coronavirus briefing. 
  "When social distancing is relaxed, contract tracing is our best hope for isolating the virus when it appears and keeping it isolated," Bloomberg said.
  He said Johns Hopkins University has developed a training class for contact tracers that can be taken remotely.
