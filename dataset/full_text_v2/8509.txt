  The Wisconsin Elections Commission said they still plan on holding primary elections on April 7, despite the continued spread of the coronavirus. They are, however, urging voters to cast absentee ballots in order to avoid large crowds on Election Day.
  “If you are worried about getting to the polls on Election Day, make sure you are registered to vote at your current address and with your current name and request an absentee ballot as soon as possible,” said Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin’s chief elections official, in a statement.
  The deadline to request absentee ballots is April 2.
  The Democratic Party of Wisconsin said it's replacing their "traditional canvassing operation with a digital organizing program" ahead of the election.
