  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he will not run for president in 2020.
  “I’m not running for president. I'm not running fro vice president. I'm not running anywhere," Cuomo said at a coronavirus news conference on Saturday. "I'm not going to Washington, I'm staying right here.
  Cuomo said that is was "flattering" that some Democrats wanted to see him replace former Vice President Joe Biden as the nominee, but also called it "irrelevant" in a time of crisis. 
  "There is no politics here. I have no political agenda, period," Cuomo said.
