  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner predicted in an interview with Time that it will be much more difficult to impose a future shutdown once the U.S. opens large swathes of the economy.
  "Once America opens up, it will be very hard for America to ever lock down again," he said Tuesday.
  Kushner's prediction comes as states en masse have started the reopening processes while health officials warn about the potential for future outbreaks or spikes later in the year — to say nothing less of the initial wave having yet to pass. Dr. Anthony Fauci said in congressional testimony Tuesday he is concerned about the potential for  states to move too hastily  in their reopening.
  The concept Kushner described  echoes  the cautionary tale of the Spanish Flu pandemic in the U.S. more than 100 years ago.
