  The long-term care facility in Washington state linked to multiple deaths in the coronavirus outbreak announced on Monday that 31 out of 35 residents have tested positive for the virus, a Life Care official said Monday.
  Of the 35 current residents of Life Care in Kirkland who were tested, 31 were positive, three were inconclusive and one was negative. More testing will be done on the inconclusive cases, Life Care public information liaison Tim Killian said Monday evening. 
  Those who tested positive will not immediately be moved to hospitals, he said. They will remain there unless symptoms become acute enough that outside hospitalization is required. Those testing negative will be moved to another wing, Killian said. Employees have not yet been tested and it’s possible they will be tested off site, but that has not been finalized, he said.
  The facility is waiting on results for around 20 residents, he said, adding that every resident within the facility has been tested.
  There have been 22 deaths in Washington state, with 20 of those in King County,  according to the state health department . Of the 20 deaths in King County, 19 have been associated with Life Care,  according to the county health department , but that statement does not say all those deaths were patients there. There have been 162 confirmed cases across the state as of late Monday afternoon.
