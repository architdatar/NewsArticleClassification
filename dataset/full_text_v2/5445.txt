  IN A BIND:  Deborah Birx, the physician leading the White House coronavirus response, is taking fire from all sides. Her reputation in the scientific and medical community was tarnished after her  sunny projections  of a virus that has now killed  152,000 Americans.  She lost the confidence of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for her  role in President Trump's delayed crisis response . And now she's the subject of Trump's own ire. 
  Trump lashed out at the public health expert, calling her “ pathetic ” a day after she issued a stark warning on TV that the deadly virus is “extraordinarily widespread” in rural and urban areas around the country — and did not rule out an estimate that virus deaths could top 300,000 by the end of the year. “In order to counter Nancy, Deborah took the bait & hit us. Pathetic!” Trump   tweeted.  
  Asked  why he attacked  a top aide for her accurate assessment, Trump said yesterday evening that he told Birx that he thought “we were doing very well” when she visited his office earlier in the day. Pressed on whether he disagreed with her characterization of the pandemic, Trump ignored the question.
  Consequences for coronavirus response:  Birx “was stung by Trump’s scathing tweet, in part because it could limit her ability to do her job, according to one person familiar with her reaction,” our colleagues  Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Yasmeen Abutaleb  report. 
  A notable shift: Birx was in Trump's good graces for months  —  especially compared to another task force member,  Anthony S. Fauci,  the  infectious-disease  expert and Birx's mentor who  had been sidelined for his candid public guidance. Yet despite her new status as household name after three decades in public service, and stylish scarves that  garnered a social media following of their own , Birx has increasingly few allies inside and outside the White House. 
  Ashley, Josh and Yasmeen report that Trump was “especially incensed that she did not strike a more optimistic tone about states that are doing well and by her praise for Pelosi” — and now “associates Birx with the failures” of the  coronavirus  response. 
  Some defenders:  Fauci defended Birx's statement about the pandemic during  a press conference,  and noted "when you have community spread it’s insidious.”  
  Birx had some backers on the Hill, such as Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who urged Trump to back off the criticism:  
  And presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden seized on the rift: 
  But Birx's support among those in the scientific and medical community has substantially diminished due to her role as a public champion of the administration's coronavirus response. 
  Trump’s tweets and statements assuring that the virus is receding are still at odds with the situation on the ground:  Cases are surging in “several Midwestern states that had not previously seen high infection rates while average daily deaths remained elevated Monday in Southern and Western states hit with a resurgence of the disease after lifting some restrictions earlier this summer,” our colleagues  Anne Gearan, John Wagner and Jacqueline Dupree  write. 
  WHAT TO WATCH IN TODAY'S PRIMARIES:  “Kansas is one of two states with GOP Senate primaries  this week have  a back-to-the-future outlook, with Tennessee voters similarly choosing between an establishment-backed candidate and an insurgent conservative trying to lay claim to the true ideological mantle,”  David Weigel and Paul Kane report . Voters in five states, Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington, will weigh in on Senate, House and gubernatorial races.
  In Kansas, Kris Kobach has sparked worries again:  Kobach, Kansas's former secretary of state, is extolling his closeness to the president. But many in the party are fearful that a victory could spell disaster for the party just two years after he lost a gubernatorial election in the conservative state. “ National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director Kevin   McLaughlin   warned … it could doom the GOP Senate majority —   and   perhaps even hurt [Trump] in a state that hasn't voted Democratic since 1964,”  Politico's James Arkin reports  of a recent call among Republican operatives. 
  ELSEWHERE ON THE TRAIL: 
  “The squad” plays defense:  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) crushed her first primary challenge, but Rep.  Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich) is expected to face a tougher contest today,  CNN's  Gregory Krieg reports . Tlib won by about 900 votes in 2018 in a six-way contest, but this time it's a one-on-one match up as the second-place finisher,  Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones, has returned and united four previous hopefuls behind her bid. 
  CENSUS BUREAU TO END ALL COUNTING EFFORTS ON SEPT. 30:  That's a month shorter than previously announced, the bureau's director confirmed Monday in a statement, and includes critical door-knocking efforts and collecting responses online, over the phone and by mail,”  NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports .
  TRUMP CLAIMS HE CAN ISSUE A MAIL-VOTING EO:  “ Trump claimed Monday that he has the authority to issue an executive order on mail-in ballots, whose increasing use, he argues, could increase election fraud and uncertainty, though it  is  unclear what he could do to curtail the practice, ”   the Associated Press reports . 
  There is a very big mail-in fiasco still unfolding:  A federal judge in Manhattan ruled “that more than a thousand disputed ballots in a closely watched congressional primary should be counted, upending a six-week-old race that has drawn the attention of [Trump] and embarrassed the New York City Board of Elections,”  the New York Times's Jesse McKinley reports .
  TRUMP SAYS TREASURY SHOULD BENEFIT FROM TIKTOK SALE:  “Trump suggested that the U.S. treasury should collect a portion of the potential sale of the social media company TikTok, although it was unclear under what authority the White House could demand such a payment,”  Jeff Stein, Rachel Lerman, Jay Greene and Jeanne Whalen report .
  TikTok stars say a ban would be devastating:  “People might think it’s just an app where people do 15-second dances, but it’s so much more,” Sixteen-year-old star Madi Monroe  told our colleague Travis Andrew s. “The app speaks to my generation — yes, we share music and dances, but we also share ideas and views on the world." 
  Trump declined to praise John Lewis:  “Trump dismissed the legacy of the late congressman John Lewis in an interview with ‘Axios on HBO,' saying only that Lewis made a ‘big mistake’ by not coming to his inauguration,"  Axios's David Nather reports . 
  Isaias charges into the Carolinas:  “After veering away from making a direct hit in Florida, Hurricane Isaias strengthened and made landfall near the border of North and South Carolina, which will followed by a dangerous trip up the rest of the Eastern Seaboard all the way to Maine through the middle of the week,”  Andrew Freedman and Jason Samenow report .
  Manhattan D.A.'s probe of Trump may be larger than previously known:  “Trump's renewed effort to shield his tax returns is part of a delay campaign seeking the immunity from prosecution that the Supreme Court has rejected, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said in a court filing Monday that suggests it is looking at a broader array of possible criminal activity than previously acknowledged,”  Shayna Jacobs reports  from New York.
