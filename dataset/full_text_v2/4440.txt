  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told House Republicans on Wednesday that he opposes extending the temporary unemployment insurance benefit of an additional $600 per week in the next coronavirus relief package.
  “This will not be in the next bill,” McConnell said, according to a readout of the call given to NBC News.
  McConnell spent much of the call talking about the need for liability protections for employers in the next package, saying that trial lawyers are “vultures” who are lining up to launch lawsuits.
  “If we do another bill, it won’t look anything like the House Democrats’ bill,” McConnell told House Republicans, according to the readout.
  The majority leader added that Republicans will have a lot to discuss next month, providing a window into his timeline of when Senate Republicans will engage in discussions. He  said Senate Republicans are unified with the House GOP and the White House, and he thanked the House members for voting against the $3 trillion Democratic relief bill last week.
