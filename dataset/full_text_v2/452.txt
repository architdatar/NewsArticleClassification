  American Airlines will reduce international capacity this summer in response to customer demand amid the coronavirus outbreak, the airline said Thursday. It is also suspending some flights from some U.S. airports to Europe.
  The changes will reduce international capacity for the summer season by 34 percent, the airline said.
  The announcement comes after President Donald Trump said Wednesday that travel would be  restricted from most of Europe for 30 days , although there are exceptions.
  The airline will continue to operate flights to and from Europe for up to seven days to give people a chance to return home. But flights between Charlotte, North Carolina, Philadelphia, and Raleigh/Durham, also in North Carolina, to some European destinations would be suspended.
