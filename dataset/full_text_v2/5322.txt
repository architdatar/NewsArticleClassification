  The principal deputy in the Defense Department’s office of inspector general, Glenn Fine, resigned Tuesday, more than a month after he was sidelined as the top watchdog overseeing coronavirus relief funds.
  Fine had served as the principal deputy and acting inspector general for more than four years in the office. He also previously worked as the inspector general of the Department of Justice.
  Trump in April removed Fine from his role after Fine was named to lead the committee that was tasked with overseeing the implementation of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package. The president said that Sean O'Donnell, the current EPA inspector general, would step in and handle both roles simultaneously.
  "The role of Inspectors General is a strength of our system of government," he said. "After many years in the DoJ and DoD OIGs, I believe the time has come for me to step down and allow others to perform this vital role. I wish the men and women of the DoD OIG and the Inspector General Community continued success in these important responsibilities."
  Fine’s resignation comes after other inspectors general within the Trump administration have been recently fired from their watchdog roles.
