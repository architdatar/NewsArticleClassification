  Even cities not yet hit hard by the pandemic are seeing larger declines. Baton Rouge traffic is down by as much as 32 percent, and Nashville by 44 percent.

  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the state will begin three studies of potential treatments for the coronavirus this week.
  One of those experimental therapies will involve taking antibodies from the plasma of patients who had been sick with COVID-19, and injecting them into patients who are currently ill.
  Researchers will also study the safety and effectiveness of combining two drugs already approved for other conditions: hydroxychloroquine, often used to treat lupus and some forms of arthritis, and the antibiotic azithromycin, more commonly called a Z-Pak.
  Cuomo also announced the state is working on blood test to determine whether a person has already had the virus and recovered.¬†
  "We believe thousands and thousands of people have had the virus and self-resolved. If you knew that, you would know who is now immune to the virus and who you can send back to work," the governor said during a briefing Monday.

  Joe Biden, in the first live appearance he's made in days, told supporters Monday that while President Donald Trump is not to blame for coronavirus, he ‚Äúdoes bear responsibility for our response.‚Äù
  In a virtual event livestreamed on his campaign website, Biden, who in recent days had held only telephone calls with reporters, called on the federal government to coordinate the acquisition and dissemination of critical medical supplies to states "so we don't have governors competing against one another" for the equipment. That call echoed one made by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.¬†
  Biden also praised several Republican governors for how they were handling their states' response to the pandemic ‚Äî including Ohio's Mike DeWine, Massachusetts' Charlie Baker and Maryland's Larry Hogan ‚Äî before calling on Congress to make sure the aid packages for large corporations include "an enforceable commitment that they will keep workers on the payroll."
  "No blank checks," Biden said.
