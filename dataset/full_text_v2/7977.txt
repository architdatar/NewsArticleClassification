  The coronavirus lockdown has kept Americans homebound and shuttered businesses and travel, throwing many of the company's drivers out of work.
  In a statement released to NBC News, Uber said it was taking these steps in order to bring costs in line and protect the future of the business.
  Uber's stock dropped by around 2 percent Wednesday morning. The company reports its quarterly earnings on Thursday.
