  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. health official who has been lauded for his straightforward communication on the coronavirus outbreak, will make a public appearance Thursday, after all.
  Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will speak live on Facebook with CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the tech executive  wrote on his Facebook wall .
  Facebook said the discussion would happen at 4 p.m. PT (7 p.m. ET).
  "He'll discuss the measures we can all take to fight the spread of the coronavirus and what the government is doing to respond to the pandemic. We'll have time for some questions from the community, so if there's a question you think I should ask, reply here in the comments," Zuckerberg wrote.
  The phrase "Where is Dr. Fauci?" was  trending  on Twitter in the afternoon after he did not appear at a White House news conference.
