  While hand-washing with soap and water has been advocated worldwide to keep the  coronavirus  at bay, some 74 million people in the Middle East lack access to a sink, soap or basic water facilities at home, a United Nations  report  published Thursday found.
  Refugees and those in conflict areas were especially at risk, the report said, living with inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene services.
  In the Gaza Strip, one of the most densely populated areas in the world, only one in 10 households has access to clean water, the U.N. said. Women and girls in rural areas and informal settlements, who usually undertake the water collection task, were being put at greater risk.
