  Last Thursday afternoon, I was working on a Nightly News story about nursing homes when  my husband, Chris Bro,  mentioned he wasn’t feeling so well. He said he was going to take a nap, which is unusual at 4 p.m. on a Thursday. A few hours later, Chris came downstairs looking pretty awful. I was busy getting dinner ready and he said he wanted to eat so he joined us at the table. “Your eyes,” I said. “They look so strange.” His eyes were  rimmed bright red .
  My next sentence was: "Something’s not right. You need to go to the basement."
  Because I’d been traveling for work in March and I’d gone into New York City from our home in the suburbs, we were concerned that I might catch the coronavirus. Our family had made a plan that if any of us got sick with possible coronavirus, we would move to our guest room and attached bathroom in the basement.
  Thursday night, Chris grabbed a stack of books and headed downstairs. He hasn’t left that room since.
