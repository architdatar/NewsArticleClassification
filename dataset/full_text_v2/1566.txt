  A passenger refused to sit next to an Asian man on New York's subway on Wednesday and sprayed him with a bottle of Febreze, the NYPD said. 
  Officers received a call about an emotionally disturbed person on an N train on Wednesday around 9 a.m., NYPD Chief Rodney Harrison said in a press conference on Thursday. 
  In a video of the incident  tweeted by New York’s Metro Transit Authority , a man is seen shouting loudly at an Asian passenger to move away and not stand next to him. The man then reaches for an aerosol, which police identified as Febreze, and sprays the victim for over fifteen seconds.

  New York's MTA said the harassment was coronavirus-related,  tweeting that good hygiene  could stop the spread of the virus, but racism would not. 
  Officers from NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force were reviewing the video as part of the investigation, said Chief Harrison.
