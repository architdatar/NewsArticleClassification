  Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., introduced a  bill  Tuesday that would forgive student loan debt for health care workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  The legislation would create “a federal and private loan forgiveness program for loans acquired to receive medical and professional training held by health care workers who have made significant contributions to ... respond to this urgent crisis,” Maloney's office said in a  news release . Nurses, doctors, medical researchers, lab workers and other healthcare professionals fighting the pandemic would be eligible for the program.
  Our nation owes an incredible debt to our health care workers on the frontlines of the  #COVID19  crisis & we need to do more than just saying thank you.   That's why I introduced legislation today to eliminate student debt for health care workers on the frontlines of  #COVID19 .  pic.twitter.com/2FqnSB7KRz 
  “Frontline health workers are delivering care to the sickest patients and putting their own safety at great risk in order to keep doing their jobs,” Maloney said in a  statement . “And in return, I believe that we have an obligation to ensure that they are relieved of the debt they incurred to train for this critical work.”
  Medical school graduates incur an average of $200,000 in student loan debt, according to  Association of American Medical Colleges .
