  There have been 18 extra-judicial killings in Nigeria by security forces while the country has been under  coronavirus  lockdown, according to the country's National Human Rights Commission, more than the number of people who have died from the virus so far.
  The commission said the killings were a "display of impunity and reckless disregard for human life in law enforcement by security personnel." Most of the deaths occurred in the northern Kaduna state.
  The  report , published late Wednesday, found 105 human rights complaints since the lockdown began on March 30, including excessive use of force, abuse of power and corruption by security forces — with Lagos State recording the highest number of incidents.
