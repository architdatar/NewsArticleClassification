  Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos toured a fulfillment center and a Whole Foods on Wednesday to thank staff, an appearance that comes as the company is  the subject of scrutiny  over how it has treated warehouse workers during the coronavirus pandemic. 
  Amazon tweeted out a video of Bezos, dressed in jeans and a white shirt, receiving a temperature check before walking around, stopping briefly to say hello to staff on the assembly line and in the store. Bezos is wearing a mask and no gloves, though the workers shown in the video are wearing both.  Bloomberg  reported that the site visits were locations in Dallas.  
  Some  warehouse and corporate employees  have called for the company to boost pay and protective measures. Last week, Amazon fired one employee in a fulfillment center in Staten Island, New York, who had  publicly called on the company  to make changes. Amazon said they had let the manager go because he was not self isolating after coming in contact with an infected worker.
  Today's visits by our founder and CEO  @JeffBezos  to say thank you to Amazon fulfillment center and  @WholeFoods  employees. We're all incredibly proud of the thousands of our colleagues working on the front lines to get critical goods to people everywhere during this crisis.  pic.twitter.com/wxth2yURON
