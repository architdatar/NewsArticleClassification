  President Donald Trump visited Norfolk, Va. on Saturday to see off the USNS Comfort,  a Navy hospital ship  that is headed to New York to provide extra space and support to medical workers in the fight against the  coronavirus outbreak .
  “This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the incredible people of New York. A place I know very well, a place I love," Trump continued.
  The USNS Comfort, which can hold about 1,000 beds, will be used to treat patients who are not infected with COVID-19 in order to free up much-needed hospital space for infected patients in New York City.
