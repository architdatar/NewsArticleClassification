  4:55 p.m. ET, April 19, 2020 UK government spokesman refutes 'untrue' and 'sloppy' Sunday Times critique of its early response to Covid-19 From CNN's Luke McGee and Nada Bashir  A UK government spokesman has refuted wide-ranging claims made by  The Sunday Times  in a damning article that criticizes the government’s early response to the coronavirus pandemic, arguing Sunday that the article contains a “series of falsehoods" that "misrepresent" the government's actions. This article contains a series of falsehoods and errors and actively misrepresents the enormous amount of work which was going on in government at the earliest stages of the coronavirus outbreak," the government’s spokesman said in a statement.  
  "The Prime Minister has been at the helm of the response to this, providing leadership during this hugely challenging period for the whole nation," the statement added.  The spokesman’s response comes after Cabinet minister Michael Gove acknowledged that -- as reported by the Sunday Times -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not attend five national security COBR meetings focused on coronavirus in January and February. According to the government’s spokesman, it is "entirely normal and proper" for such meetings to be chaired by the relevant secretary of state, as opposed to the Prime Minister.  “It is ridiculous to suggest that coronavirus only reached the UK because the Health Secretary and not the PM chaired a COBR meeting,” the spokesman said.  Additionally, The Sunday Times reported that a number of opportunities to reduce the impact of the pandemic had been missed by the UK government in January, February and March, claiming that UK officials "sleepwalked into disaster" and "played down the looming threat" of coronavirus.  The government’s spokesman rejected such claims, asserting the government "started to act as soon as it was alerted to a potential outbreak" of coronavirus.  “The suggestion that the government’s attitude was nonchalant is wrong. Extensive and detailed work was going on in government because of coronavirus," the spokesman said.  "The government’s scientific advisory groups started to meet in mid-January and (Health Secretary Matt) Hancock instituted daily meetings to grip the emerging threat. We have taken the right steps at the right time guided by the scientific evidence," the spokesman added.

  Tyson Foods says it is following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Agriculture and health departments after some of its team members tested positive for coronavirus.

The company has also expanded work spaces by erecting tents.  “We're extremely grateful for the work our team members are doing and for the role they play in the critical supply chain that extends from farm to fork,” Gonzalez said. 
  Tyson Foods spokesperson Worth Sparkman said in a statement the company is also sanitizing plant production areas and has deep cleaned other areas of the facility, including employee break rooms and locker rooms. "We have team members dedicated to constantly wiping down and sanitizing common areas. In some cases, this additional cleaning involves suspending a day of production," Sparkman said.

  More than 100,000 people defied Bangladesh's lockdown order on Saturday to attend the funeral of a senior leader of the Islamist party in the district of Brahmanbaria, according to the prime minister's special assistant, Shah Ali Farhad, and the Brahmanbaria police spokesperson Imtiaz Ahmed.  The funeral for Maulana Zubayer Ahmad Ansari, an Islamic teacher, broke the country's ban of no more than five people attending prayers at one time, sparking fears of a new coronavirus outbreak emerging from the event.  Tens of thousands of people flooded the roads to Brahmanbaria district, walking from the surrounding areas to attend the funeral, according to Mohammad Mamunul Haque, the joint secretary general of the Islamist party.  The police were unable to control the crowd, resulting in the officer in charge and assistant superintendent being withdrawn from the event and a "three-member probe committee" being formed to start an investigation into the congregation activity, according to Sohel Rana, the Bangladesh Police Central spokesperson. Bangladesh has a recorded total of  2,456 positive cases of coronavirus, with 91 deaths  as of Sunday, though critics say the true number is higher and still unknown due to lack of testing kits.

  2:16 p.m. ET, April 19, 2020 Coronavirus outbreak in Austria is "under control," chancellor says From CNN's Nada Bashir A view of a shop in Vienna, Austria, on April 17. David Visnjic/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images 
  The coronavirus outbreak in Austria in "under control," Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said Sunday, crediting the positive development as a result of the government's early implementation of strict containment measures.  "We were one of the first countries in Europe which decided to have a complete lockdown, and I think it was extremely important that we were faster than others and our reaction was tougher than in other countries," Kurz told CNN. "It was good that we did it because now the situation in Austria is under control. We only have about 100 new infections every day," he added.  
  According to the Austrian leader, the number of new in-country coronavirus cases continues to go down, prompting the government to look towards a gradual relaxation of the nationwide lockdown.  "What we are trying is to re-open very slowly and very carefully. We are doing this step-by-step, always with two weeks in between," Kurz said. "It is important that we always have two weeks in between, which gives us the opportunity to watch the numbers very carefully and slow down our re-opening plan and, if necessary, pull the emergency brake." Kurz outlined that the government expects to allow small shops to open on Monday, extending to all shops by May 1; by mid-May, the government will look to extend this measure further to include restaurants, he added.  "Of course, we will still have restrictions like social distancing…people in shops and also, in the future, people in restaurants and elsewhere will have to wear masks," Kurz said.

  1:56 p.m. ET, April 19, 2020 Cuba records more than 1,000 cases of coronavirus  From CNN's Patrick Oppmann in Havana  Cuba has reported 1,035 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to health officials on Sunday.  This is the first time the total number of infected people has topped 1,000 on the island.  Cuba has enacted some of the region’s toughest restrictions as officials combat the spread of the disease, suspending nearly all domestic and international travel. Citizens who return from abroad are required to spend 14 days at government isolation facilities and anyone suspected of having coronavirus must immediately go to hospital for treatment. The economic impacts of the pandemic have led to longer lines for food and other basic items, complicating efforts to stem the spread of the infection.  As of Sunday, the death toll stands at 34, according to Dr. Francisco Durán García, Cuba’s national director of Epidemiology at the Ministry of Public Health.

  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she could back a proposal from other Democratic congressional leaders to allow proxy voting during the coronavirus pandemic — a possible solution to the logistical issues facing members of Congress as they attempt to navigate the challenge of working on complex legislation from afar.  Pelosi said on Fox today that relevant committee chairs had arrived at the idea of proxy voting after she tasked them with considering ways to keep up with House business while members adhered to federal guidelines recommending against travel and gathering in groups.

  1:16 p.m. ET, April 19, 2020 Louisiana is in a "much better place today than we thought we were going to be," governor says From CNN's Carma Hassan Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards speaks on April 15. Travis Spradling/The Advocate via AP 
  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a news conference today that even though the number of coronavirus cases is growing, the state has less people in the hospital and less people using ventilators.  He also said the number of deaths “is a lagging indicator” and “it still appears that we are trending in a good direction and that’s a good thing.” The state reported 348 new cases of Covid-19 which brings the total to 23,928. There were 29 new deaths which brings the total number of deaths in Louisiana to 1,296, Edwards said. “Now the number of cases and the number of deaths are lower than they have been for the last number of days, that’s a good thing, but I would caution everybody that typically on Sunday the numbers go down,” Edwards said. “It’s just a function of when the labs report and so forth, so what we would like to see is a continued downward trajectory tomorrow and Tuesday and on through the week.” 
  “We’re in much, much better place today than we thought we were going to be,” Edwards said, adding that Louisiana citizens are taking the stay at home order seriously and sticking to social distancing guidelines. Edwards doesn’t think life will go back to normal until there is a vaccine for coronavirus, but they will take some steps in the meantime. “As always, I want to remind everyone that it’s going to take all of us working together and for some period of time to defeat this virus, get back to life as normal,” Edwards said. “We’re not going to see that for a while and I suspect we won’t fully see it until after there’s a vaccine that’s administered to the entire population.”
