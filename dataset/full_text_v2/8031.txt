  Retailer Urban Outfitters  announced on Twitter  Saturday it was closing stores "until further notice" as a precaution.
  It joins a number of U.S. retailers,  including Apple , that have announced store closures in the era of coronavirus. Urban Outfitters is one of the more prominent names in fashion and home goods to do so.
  Lululemon , which sells athletic clothing, said Friday its North American stores would be limited to the hours between noon and 6 p.m. Celeste Burgoyne, executive vice president of the Americas, said in an email to customers that Lululemon has also  suspended in-store workout classes and events.
