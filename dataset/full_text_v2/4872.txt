  The New York Times plans to dedicate its entire Sunday front page to hundreds of names of Americans killed by the coronavirus.
  On Saturday, it tweeted an image of the page, which is topped with the headline, "U.S. DEATHS NEAR 100,000, AN INCALCULABLE LOSS."
  An introduction to the list explains,"The 1,000 people here reflect just 1 percent of the toll." Victims get brief descriptions: "Florencio Almazo Morán, 65, New York City, one-man army."
  Marc Lacey, the Times' national editor, said in  a story explaining the presentation , "I wanted something that people would look back on in 100 years to understand the toll of what we’re living through."
  In April, NBC News documented  "60 Lives 60 Days: Stories of victims we've lost from COVID-19 two months since the first U.S. death."
