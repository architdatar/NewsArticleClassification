  "My whole career's been about service," he said. "As a  military veteran  and also as a police officer, we serve the ones that need help all over the country."
  He added: "What a great opportunity to grab this trailer load -- 88 drums of hand sanitizer -- and deliver it to the NYPD. ... We've done two shipments already. That's almost 10,000 gallons."
  On Friday, the NYPD reported 7,096 uniformed members were out sick, accounting for nearly 20 percent of the force. More than 2,300 uniformed employees have tested positive so far for  coronavirus . Two have died due to complications related to the  virus .
  In early April, the  White House  told reporters at a daily briefing that it had received an "SOS" from the NYPD saying that the department urgently needed hand sanitizer.
  "Within two hours, we had 50-gallon drums on a UPS truck heading up to the NYPD," White House adviser  Peter Navarro  said.
  McKown said he picked up the load in Pennsylvania and immediately took off for his destination: Flushing, N.Y.
  "It's a time when we all need to pitch in," he told "Fox & Friends" host Pete Hegseth. "I'm just so happy that I got a chance."
  "I was honored to meet the guys: The men and women of the NYPD."

  McKown said the officers were extremely appreciative.
  "You know, it's bringing something to them that may very well save their life -- this hand sanitizer,"  he said.
