  Las Vegas  Mayor Carolyn Goodman  on Wednesday offered up her 650,000 constituents as a "control group" against  shutdown orders  while bitterly complaining that her tourism-reliant city is being economically ravaged.
  "How do you know until we have a control group? We offered to be a control group,"  Goodman told CNN , when asked if lifting shutdown orders would lead to a spike coronavirus deaths. "I did offer, it was turned down."
  Goodman said her proposal, to measure the public health impact of opening Las Vegas for business again, was turned down because too many people in town at any given moment are from outside city limits — thus making a proper statistical analysis impossible.
  The mayor's proposal didn't set well with late-night host and  Las Vegas native Jimmy Kimmel , who tweeted: "Carolyn Goodman should resign before lunch arrives today. She is an embarrassment to my hometown."
