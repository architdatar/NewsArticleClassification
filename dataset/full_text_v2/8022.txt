  11:31 a.m. ET, May 17, 2020 White House trade adviser says CDC "let the country down" on coronavirus testing From CNN's Kristen Holmes and Arman Azad  Pete Marovich/Pool/Getty Images 
  Amid reports of growing tension between the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro slammed the top healthy agency, saying “it let the country down” on testing. “Early on in this crisis, the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space — really let the country down with the testing. Not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy they had a bad test and that set us back,” Navarro said on NBC. 
  A spokesperson for the CDC did not have any immediate comment. More from the White House:  The comments from Navarro Sunday come as CNN reported that  tensions are rising  between the White House and the nation's leading public health agency.  In interviews, senior administration officials in Washington as well as top officials at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta described a growing sense of mistrust and animosity between the White House and CDC over how quickly the US should reopen and how the government tracks data on the virus.  In particular, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator for the President's coronavirus task force, has become increasingly critical of the CDC, making clear in recent meetings that she is more than frustrated with the agency, according to two senior administration officials.  Specifically, Birx believes the way the CDC gathers data on the coronavirus is antiquated, causing inaccurate and delayed numbers on both virus cases and deaths. Some background:   Contamination in manufacturing  the CDC test for the coronavirus caused weeks of delays that slowed the US response to the pandemic, multiple health officials told CNN last month, a problem that stemmed in part from the CDC not adhering to its own protocols, according to a US Food and Drug Administration spokesperson. The government has never fully explained what stalled the rollout of a crucial test needed to begin measuring the extent of the spread of Covid-19. It would take until the end of February to correct.

  11:03 a.m. ET, May 17, 2020 Get caught up on the latest coronavirus headlines From CNN's Elise Hammond  Mario Tama/Getty Images 
  It's about 11 a.m. in New York and 4 p.m. in London. If you're just tuning in, here's what you need to know. Social distancing works:  That's what a new study found. Researchers said that government-imposed social distancing cut the virus’ daily growth rate by about 9% after roughly three weeks, and without it, the number cases in the US could have been 35 times higher. Texas  saw its highest single day increase in positive coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic. The state reported an increase of at least 1,801 positive coronavirus cases yesterday –– 734 of those originated from employees of meat plants. Health issues related to not reopening:  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said reopening the economy is an issue of "health versus health" and that there are "serious health consequences" to keeping states shut down including suicides, children not being vaccinated and cardiac issues not being treated. Stimulus bill:  California Gov. Gavin Newsom said his state faces a $54.3 billion budget deficit that is "directly Covid-induced" and that the federal government has an ethical and moral obligation to help states and county governments. Beaches  in New York City will not be open for swimming on Memorial Day, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, saying "it was not safe." De Blasio said people could walk on the beaches, however.

  10:41 a.m. ET, May 17, 2020 New York City reports decrease in positive coronavirus tests  From CNN's Kristina Sgueglia  Mayor de Blasio's Office 
  The percentage of positive tests and intensive care unit admissions in New York City have both dropped, Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news briefing on Sunday. At least 469 people were reported in ICU’s as of Friday, and those numbers are down from the 506 reported on Thursday. Of the people tested for Covid-19, about 11% have tested positive across the city as of Friday, down 13% from Thursday. Another spike in cases:  While the city is preparing for things to get better they are also preparing for bad scenarios “and that would mean tightening up restrictions" if cases were to "boomerang," de Blasio said.  “If you don’t follow these rules unfortunately there’s a danger of that boomerang and even more restrictions," de Blasio said.

  10:35 a.m. ET, May 17, 2020 Beaches in New York City will not open for Memorial Day, mayor says From CNN's Sheena Jones  Mayor de Blasio's Office 
  Mayor Bill de Blasio said beaches in New York City will not be opened on Memorial Day, saying "it is not safe." “It is not the right thing to do in the epicenter of this crisis," de Blasio said at a news briefing on Sunday. 
  But even though beaches remain closed to swimming, walking on the beach is permitted. The New York Police Department will increase patrols across the beaches and parks, de Blasio said. “There will not be swimming, it will not be allowed, there will not be lifeguards on duty,” he added. The city will add fencing to control entry points and more fencing in reserve to close off the beaches if needed, adding its not something they want to do. Access will be further restricted if social distancing or no-swim rules are not observed.  “Were going to give people a chance to get it right," de Blasio said. The mayor is asking people to not have gatherings on the beach and if they do, “up will come the fences, closing off those beaches.”

  10:34 a.m. ET, May 17, 2020 Former CDC director: Fighting pandemic without the agency "is like fighting with one arm tied behind your back" From CNN's Arman Azad  Alex Wong/Getty Images 
  Asked about the sidelining of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the coronavirus pandemic, former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said it was “like fighting with one arm tied behind your back.” Frieden, the CDC director under President Obama, was asked about the agency on Fox News this weekend.  “Very briefly, do you think it’s been a mistake for this administration to sideline the CDC?” Fox’s Chris Wallace asked. “I think fighting this pandemic without the CDC is like fighting with one arm tied behind your back,” Frieden said.  These comments came after a discussion about the agency’s role under the Trump administration. “As far back as I can remember, the CDC has always been the lead agency in health crises like this,” Wallace noted, pointing to Ebola and other diseases. “This time, it seems like the CDC has been sidelined to some degree,” Wallace said, noting the agency’s lack of public briefings. Some context:  CNN has previously reported on  growing tensions  between the White House and the CDC during the coronavirus pandemic.  Senior administration officials in Washington and at the CDC, for example, have described a growing sense of mistrust and animosity over how quickly the US should reopen and how the government tracks data on the virus. CNN has also reported on tensions between the White House and CDC over guidelines on how to reopen the country.  A leaked 68-page document from the agency described a detailed approach to reopening states and businesses, but those guidelines have not been publicly released. On Thursday, the CDC published six ages of graphics labeled "decision trees" as updated guidance.

  Mayor Bill de Blasio said New York City is partnering with 123 CityMd urgent care centers across the five boroughs to increase Covid-19 testing across the city, De Blasio also announced that daily citywide testing capacity has reached 20,000 ahead of scheduled. “We predict to begin 6,000 testings per day,” de Blasio said Sunday.

More on the contact tracers:  The first class of 500 contact tracers have completed their Johns Hopkins training and there are 1,000 more in progress, the mayor said. Field training will take place the week of May 24. This includes learning about more than 100 potential case types. The mayor expects to have an additional 1,000 tracers ready to go by the end of May, he said. The test and trace corps are deploying Resource Navigators in every community by June 1.

  10:15 a.m. ET, May 17, 2020 Lack of testing leads to undercounting of coronavirus cases in Aden, Yemen From CNN’s Nada AlTaher There are coronavirus-related deaths in Yemen’s southern port city of city of Aden that are going unreported due to lack of testing, a source with intimate knowledge of the situation in Aden told CNN. Aden accounts for 71 out of the 122 cases reported in government-controlled areas, according to the latest statistics published by the country’s Supreme National Emergency Committee for Covid-19 on Saturday. In one hospital, 20 out of 60 patients that arrived over a five-day period, died due to what doctors believe were Covid-19 related reasons, the local source said. “The patients died shortly after their arrival to hospital and were not tested – so their deaths were not ‘officially’ considered to be Covid-19 related even though all the signs said otherwise,” said the local source who declined to be named for security reasons.
