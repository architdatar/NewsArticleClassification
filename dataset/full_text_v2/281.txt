  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the state will begin three studies of potential treatments for the coronavirus this week.
  One of those experimental therapies will involve taking antibodies from the plasma of patients who had been sick with COVID-19, and injecting them into patients who are currently ill.
  Researchers will also study the safety and effectiveness of combining two drugs already approved for other conditions: hydroxychloroquine, often used to treat lupus and some forms of arthritis, and the antibiotic azithromycin, more commonly called a Z-Pak.
  Cuomo also announced the state is working on blood test to determine whether a person has already had the virus and recovered.Â 
  "We believe thousands and thousands of people have had the virus and self-resolved. If you knew that, you would know who is now immune to the virus and who you can send back to work," the governor said during a briefing Monday.
