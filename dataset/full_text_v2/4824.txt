  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Saturday that the city's schools will remain closed for the rest of the school year, but less than three hours later, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the mayor lacks the authority to make such a decision.
  Cuomo said it was only the mayor's "opinion" to keep schools closed until fall, and that the governor holds authority on this issue.
  "He didn't close them, and he can't reopen," Cuomo said of the mayor and the vast school district that serves over 1.1 million students in 1,800 schools.
  De Blasio in announcing the continued closure earlier Saturday, said, "It's not an easy decision but it's the right decision," adding, "It clearly will help us save lives."
