  Many Democrats left a briefing for all House lawmakers on Capitol Hill Thursday frustrated with what they described as an unsatisfactory briefing in which they left with many lingering questions.
  "That was simply the worst briefing I have ever received in seven or eight years of Congress," said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., to reporters after the closed-door meeting.
  "The administration has no good answers, no plan and no leadership. I think members from both parties are frustrated and angry and they have every right to be. I think its time for the White House to take the training wheels off and provide real leadership for this public health emergency," he added.
  Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who represents most of the Seattle area, a region significantly impacted by the virus, praised some of the briefers like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who she called "excellent." 
  "So, we just need to be honest with the American people about where we are," she said. "And I don't think that this president or some members of the administration are doing that."
