  Author J.K. Rowling said on  Twitter  on Monday that she had been suffering from COVID-19 symptoms but was now "fully recovered," adding that she had not been officially tested.
  She shared a video put together by a hospital outlining helpful breathing techniques to relieve respiratory symptoms, saying that she had found it useful. The "Harry Potter" author urged fans to stay home and safe during the outbreak.
  Please watch this doc from Queens Hospital explain how to relieve respiratory symptoms. For last 2 weeks I've had all symptoms of C19 (tho haven't been tested) & did this on doc husband's advice. I'm fully recovered & technique helped a lot. https://t.co/xo8AansUvc  via  @YouTube
