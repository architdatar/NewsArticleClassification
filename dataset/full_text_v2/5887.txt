  A 6-year-old Tennessee boy who lives with  cystic fibrosis  survived his battle against COVID-19 after being diagnosed with the disease last month.
  “I’m a cystic fibrosis warrior and I beat COVID-19!” Joseph Bostain said in  a viral video  posted on his mother’s Facebook this week.
  Joseph is one of  more than 3,000 people  in the state of Tennessee who have tested positive for coronavirus.
  People with underlying medical conditions such as cystic fibrosis, which causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time, are more vulnerable to COVID-19.
  Sabrina Bostain, Joseph's mother, documented her son's recovery in a series of Facebook posts as Joseph spent weeks quarantined at home after coming down with a fever and cough. He also spent time in a hospital.
  In the video announcing his recovery, Joseph thanked everyone who prayed for him and sent him cards and gifts as he was battling the coronavirus.
