  The wife of Chinese doctor Li Wenliang who was punished by police for blowing the whistle on coronavirus before he died from the respiratory illness, has rejected a proposal to rename the street of Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. in his honor. 
  The proposed bill to name the street  "Li Wenliang Plaza" in his honor was rebuffed by Fu Xuejie, who wrote on social media that she learned the news online. 
  “It is very sad to hear this news. Wenliang is a communist and deeply loves his motherland,” she said. “We really don’t want anyone to use Wenliang for hype."
  Republican Senator Tom Cotton introduced  the bill  earlier this month because “the Chinese Communist Party wants the world to forget Dr. Li Wenliang... We can ensure his name is never forgotten," he said.
