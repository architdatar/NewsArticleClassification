  President Donald Trump said that he was not planning to postpone the Republican National Convention in Charlotte schedule for August. 
  “We are having the convention at the end of August,” Trump said Saturday at a press briefing. “I think we are going to have a great convention,” he continued, adding that there was no contingency plan.
  The Democrats announced earlier in the week that they would  delay their convention in Milwaukee  from July 1 to Aug. 17.
