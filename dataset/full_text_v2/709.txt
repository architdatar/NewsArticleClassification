  The number of doctors who have died in Italy since the coronavirus epidemic began has risen to 23, the Italian federation of doctors said today. Unfortunately, the sad list of doctors who fell during the Covid-19 epidemic is getting longer. And while the official data of infected health workers increases, released every evening by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, many doctors die suddenly, even if the cause of death is not directly attributable to the virus," the federation says in a statement on its website. 
  Some 19 of the 23 deceased doctors worked in the Lombardy region, the worst affected by coronavirus. The other four worked in Naples (South Italy), Emilia Romagna (north Italy) and Marche (central Italy). Some 4,824 health workers have been infected by coronavirus, according to the latest report by the institute published on Sunday.

  Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said her husband has tested positive for coronavirus. "I have news that many Americans are facing right now: my husband John has the coronavirus. We just got the test results at 7 a.m. this morning," Klobuchar wrote in a Medium post. The Democratic senator and former 2020 presidential candidate said that her husband has been "cut off from all visitors" and that she will also not see him during this time, but that she and her daughter "are constantly calling and texting and emailing." "We love him very much and pray for his recovery. He is exhausted and sick but a very strong and resilient person," she wrote. Her husband was admitted to a Virginia hospital, she wrote, and now has pneumonia "and is on oxygen, but not a ventilator." Klobuchar said that she and her husband have not been in the same place over the last two weeks and because "I am outside the 14-day period for getting sick, my doctor has advised me not to get a test."

  10:54 a.m. ET, March 23, 2020 Scientists working on $25 coronavirus test From CNN's Nick Paton Walsh Scientists at Oxford University have developed a 30-minute test for COVID-19, which can be done anywhere. The raw materials for it cost about $25. A team at the Engineering Science Laboratory, working with partner medics in China had an 8 week head-start on developing the test, which uses a mix of chemicals and enzymes which turn from pink to yellow in color in the presence of the virus.  The test has a huge advantage in both its speed, but also because the chemicals only need to be kept at 65 ° C (or 150 ° F) for half an hour, which can be done easily in any hospital, or even eventually at home. While there are hurdles ahead, the test may be able to complete clinical trials in the coming days.  "We have 3 things to do," Professor Zhengfang Cui, who led the team, said. "The first is to get clinical trials. We just started those here at Oxford University Hospital. The second thing is regulatory approval, which is based on the number of tests done.  "The third is to get industry partners to implement large scale manufacture. For that, we need clean rooms and manufacturing facilities. And then we can roll out he product," Zhenfang said, adding that he hoped the steps can be completed in 2 to 4 weeks. Watch:

  Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker announced today that the state is closing non-essential businesses. The order goes into effect on Tuesday at noon.

Residents are advised to stay home and avoid unnecessary travel and other unnecessary activities during this two-week time period,” his administration said in a press release. 
  Baker said the state wants 3 million items of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers and is getting some via donation.

  Sen. Rand Paul is at home in Kentucky, his office tells CNN. He drove himself home from Washington. Paul is  the first US senator  to test positive for coronavirus. A  statement  from Paul's office posted to his Twitter account Sunday said he was "feeling fine" and was "tested out of an abundance of caution."  But some senators and aides are angry at Paul for not doing more to self-quarantine earlier and for potentially exposing senators to the coronavirus. Paul attended a major black-tie social event in Louisville, Kentucky, two weeks ago where several attendees have subsequently tested positive, including the wife of Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer.

  Nineteen out of India’s total 28 states and nine union territories have ordered a complete lockdown in a bid to tackle the spread of coronavirus.  Six states and union territories have issued a full lockdown only in certain districts, while three states/union territories have imposed partial restrictions to promote social distancing, said the country’s Junior Health Secretary Lav Agarwal at a press conference on Monday. In states that have imposed a complete lockdown, only essential services will be operational. These water, electricity, health services, fire services, groceries and municipal services. All shops, commercial establishments, factories, workshops, offices, markets and places of worship will be closed and interstate buses and metros will be suspended. Construction activity will also be on a halt during this period. The 19 states/union territories that have implemented a total lockdown are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Nagaland, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. This covers some of the biggest cities in the 1.3 billion-strong nation, including the capital New Delhi, the financial hub of Mumbai, the tech cities of Bangalore and Hyderabad as well as Pune and Kolkata. In Delhi and Mumbai, gatherings of more than five and four people respectively are prohibited and will be a chargeable offense. In a tweet posted by the Press Information Bureau (PIB), the Cabinet Secretary has written letters to State Chief Secretaries “highlighting that states must monitor situation 24x7, additional restrictions if necessary may be imposed, all current restrictions must be enforced strongly and all violations should be met with legal action.” The lockdown will be in place until March 31.
