  Photos of a young woman telling her grandfather about her engagement through the window of a care home under lockdown have highlighted the impact coronavirus is having on families. 
  Carly Boyd is seen in photos excitedly showing her grandfather Shelton her new engagement ring through the window of his bedroom at the care home. 
  Like other residents of the Premier Living & Rehab Center in Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina, the elderly man cannot receive visitors in  keeping with the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  guidelines.
  In a second photo also  posted to the center's Facebook page , Boyd and her grandfather are seen pressing their hands against a pane of glass that separates them. 
  "She was right there with her hand pointing to it. He was lying up there eating some ice cream," Gennie Parnell, the facility's administrator, told NBC News over the phone.
  "She put her hand up on the window and he put his hand on the window and we all just fell apart," Parnell added.
