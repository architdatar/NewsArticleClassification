  9:42 a.m. ET, May 3, 2020 Birx said Michigan protests were "devastatingly worrisome" From CNN's Nicky Robertson Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, on Monday, April 20, in Washington.

  Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said that the  protests last week  in the Michigan state legislature were “devastatingly worrisome to me, personally.”  In an interview on Fox today, Birx expressed her concern about protestors exposing elderly family members to the virus because if there was an “unfortunate outcome,” those people would feel guilty. Birx called on Americans to “protect each other, at the same time we are voicing our discontent.” About the protests:  Protesters crammed inside the capitol building where the lawmakers were meeting on Friday, demanding an end to the state's state of emergency. About 400 to 700 people stood on the Capitol grounds, according to Michigan State Police. The state of emergency was set to expire on Thursday. On Friday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed executive orders that terminated the old state of emergency and put in place a new one through May 28.  Last week, Whitmer had extended the separate stay-at-home order through May 15.

  9:41 a.m. ET, May 3, 2020 Chief economic advisor addresses his coronavirus comment from February From CNN's Elise Hammond White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow defended his initial response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying "my quote then was based on the actual facts which at the time." Kudlow  said on February 25 , "we have contained this. I won't say airtight, but pretty close to airtight. We've done a good job in the United States." At that time, the US had 53 confirmed cases, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was warning there would be "community spread in the country." "My quote was, at that time, there were very few cases. Then, as the virus spread exponentially in ways that virtually no one could have predicted, of course we changed our mind," Kudlow told CNN Sunday morning. 
  "There was hardly any cases," he added. Kudlow said the administration was dealing with the information they had at the time. "When the information changes, you change. We changed our strategy. So did everybody else around the world change their strategy," he said. Watch:

  9:43 a.m. ET, May 3, 2020 Spain's coronavirus daily death toll lowest in 6 weeks From CNN's Helena Cavendish de Moura in Atlanta and Ingrid Formanek in Spain Spain reported 164 deaths from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, the lowest number in six weeks, according to new figures released by the country’s Ministry of Health on Sunday. “As sad as it is to speak about the deaths, the increase of 0.7 percent from the previous day is a good number” said Fernando Simón, Spain’s director for health emergencies, comparing the number to coronavirus fatality figures in recent weeks.  
  The total number of deaths since the start of the pandemic in the country stands at 25,264. Speaking at the government’s daily coronavirus technical briefing, Simón noted a “clear decrease of numbers” of new hospital and intensive care unit admissions, as well as a 0.39% rise in new infections since Saturday, which are about half of the numbers of those who have recovered in the same period.   Simón cautioned that Sunday’s markedly improved numbers could be influenced by the delayed long weekend holiday reporting from Spain’s 17 regions.  More data:  A total of 42,111 health workers have been infected by coronavirus to date, Spain’s health ministry Sunday reported, representing nearly one fifth of all cases at 19%.  As Spain gradually begins its de-escalation from strict confinement-in-place orders in place since March 15, four islands in the Canaries and the Balearics will be the first to transition to so-called "Phase One" on Monday. During this time, a further opening up of small businesses and further lifting of restrictions on movements is expected because the islands “have not had any new cases in many days, and very few, or no new infections."

  9:23 a.m. ET, May 3, 2020 A speedy return to normal is "unrealistic," Dallas mayor says ​From CNN's David Wright Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson. Source: CNN via Cisco Webex 
  Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said his main priority is to keep people safe as some lockdown measures in Texas began to ease on Friday. “What I have to do is do my job as the mayor of Dallas, which is to keep our people safe," Johnson told CNN. 
  People in Dallas are “putting their toe back in" and  "aren't pouring back into these restaurants and into movie theaters and malls and things because they don't feel like it's safe to do so," Johnson said. The mayor also expressed skepticism about the prospects of a speedy return to the “normal” of three months ago, as President Trump has suggested would be possible. Johnson called that prospect "unrealistic." “It's impossible to say what we think is going to happen in the next few months. But I think this, I think it's unrealistic to believe that we're going to be able to be shoulder to shoulder here anymore soon," Johnson said. "As much as we want to control things, to try to pick a date on the calendar and say we will be opened by this date and we will be shoulder to shoulder at baseball games by this date, it doesn't work that way," he added.

  9:06 a.m. ET, May 3, 2020 Here's why you can't find flour in grocery stores From CNN's  Zachary B. Wolf Shelves in the flour section are largely empty save for a few organic options at the Hannaford supermarket in Scarborough on Friday, March 27. Gregory Rec/Portland Press Herald/Getty Images 
  Despite meat processing plants across the US  shutting down  due to coronavirus concerns, for now, you can still find plenty of meat in the grocery stores. One thing you can't find on the shelves is flour. Stores are cleaned out and it's not currently available on most websites. But why is that? Carey Underwood, who is director of mission-driven partnerships and programs at King Arthur Flour, said it's because people have been baking a lot. "People who were baking monthly are now baking weekly, and people who were baking weekly are baking daily," she said. "We expect this increase in baking to continue for the foreseeable future as trends show more in-home eating compared to dining out and people choosing to bake the food staples they cannot find in their grocery stores." 
  Underwood said the shortage in grocery stores is because of the spike in demand for flour, not because there is a shortage of wheat. "The demand for all signature flours, but especially all-purpose and bread flours, is simply unprecedented and is outpacing the inventory in our warehouses," she said. Underwood added:  "The wheat is available, but it must be milled, bagged, and transported to warehouses. These steps simply take time and the flour is selling out again as quickly as it reaches shelves." Read more.

  9:59 a.m. ET, May 3, 2020 About $175 billion has been given out in the second round of small business loans, administration says From CNN's Kevin Bohn Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin listens during a roundtable with industry executives, in the State Dinning Room of the White House, on Wednesday, April 29, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP 
  The Trump administration announced Sunday that at least 2.2 million loans, worth about $175 billion, have been paid out in the second round of federal emergency relief aid for small businesses. The  second relief package  was signed into law by Trump on April 24 and included an additional $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The second round of PPP was distributed starting on April 27. In a joint statement Sunday morning, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Small Business Administration Administrator Jovita Carranza said the average size of a loan made under the second round of the program was $79,000.  During the first round, there was criticism over how some large corporations and other entities like private schools had applied for, and were given, loans. “The Paycheck Protection Program is providing critical support to millions of small businesses and tens of millions of hardworking Americans,” Mnuchin and Carranza said in the statement adding the average loan size indicated “…the program is broadly based and assisting the smallest of small businesses.” 
  The administration said since the launch of the PPP, about 3.8 million loans, totaling more than $500 billion, have been made.

  The novel coronavirus has infected more than  3.4 million people  and killed at least 244,000 worldwide. If you're just joining us now, here are the latest developments on the pandemic. Parks and protests in US:  The pandemic drove people across the US outside  for recreation  and  protest.  While thousands rallied in California, residents of New York City and Washington DC enjoyed warmer weather Saturday while observing social  distancing . States including Pennsylvania and New Jersey were able to visit some state parks, forest facilities and golf courses for the first time this spring. Russia cases spike:  Russia reported 10,633 new coronavirus cases in another record single-day increase Sunday, bringing the total to 134,687 cases and 1,280 deaths. Russia has seen four days of record increases after a week of steady growth. Moscow, the country’s worst-hit city, accounts for more than half the cases. UK launches app:  A contact-tracing  app  will be released this week in the UK as the country's transport minister suggested people would be encouraged to walk or ride to work when restrictions ease. Prime Minister Boris  Johnson  said doctors had plans in case things went "badly wrong" when he was in hospital with the coronavirus. Leaders pledge funds:  The  leaders  of France, Norway, Italy and Germany have pledged to raise an initial $8 billion on Monday in an “international alliance” to find a vaccine and treatments for the coronavirus. They said more funding would be required to achieve their aim of developing and delivering medicines worldwide. China's busy holiday weekend:  Mainland  China  reported no new deaths for the fifth day in a row Saturday, as people flocked to attractions around the country for the Labour Day weekend. Meanwhile, Harbin City, on the Russia-China border, closed all dine-in restaurants until further notice, according to state-run CCTV.  France's deaths decline:  The daily number of deaths from coronavirus in France continues to decline. At least 24,760 people have died from coronavirus, an increase of 166 since Friday, the Health Ministry announced Saturday. The French government will extend its state of emergency for another two months. Thailand lifts alcohol ban:  Thailand began to ease some of its month-long restrictions today, as Covid-19 cases continue to fall. Businesses such as markets and hairdressers can reopen, train and bus stations can also reopen and bars can sell alcoholic drinks, but people must consume them at home.  Philippines suspends air travel:  All passenger and commercial flights to and from the country were suspended today to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

  7:38 a.m. ET, May 3, 2020 Across the world, dictatorial regimes use Covid-19 to quash press freedom Opinion from Alan C. Miller Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by attacks on press freedoms and journalists around the world amid the pandemic. We've seen this pattern before: A crisis engulfs a nation, and its government moves to curtail, manipulate or shut down news coverage. But that doesn't mean that we should pay less attention to it now. In fact, we should be especially vigilant.  Iran has imposed sweeping restrictions on coverage of the pandemic, including a  ban on printing newspapers . Journalists have been arrested for their reporting, including one who  criticized the government's failure  to prepare and another who  alleged that a local official had tested positive  for Covid-19. In Hungary, a new law giving the prime minister wide-ranging emergency powers includes a provision prohibiting publication of "false information" on the pandemic, with violators facing up to five years in prison. The law has generated uncertainty over whether journalists could be prosecuted for reporting true information. China's government maintains that controlling information is necessary to combat the virus. Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who traveled in January to Wuhan and posted videos on YouTube reporting that hospitals were overwhelmed,  has not been heard from  since February 6.  This "Covid-19 crackdown" — as Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,  has called it  — is unfolding as we mark  World Press Freedom Day  on May 3, in a reminder to defend the press from attacks on its independence, and remember those who have lost their lives while keeping us informed. This year, that reminder is particularly resonant. Read more:
