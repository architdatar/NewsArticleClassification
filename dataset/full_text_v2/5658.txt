  Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British Iranian mother who has been  imprisoned in Iran since 2016 , may have contracted coronavirus, her husband said. 
  Richard Ratcliffe said in a statement issued by the Free Nazanin Campaign that Tehran's Evin Prison, where she is detained, has repeatedly refused to test her for the respiratory illness following a "strange cold" that has not improved in more than five days. 
  "For a long time this has not felt like a normal cold," he said. "These symptoms have lasted almost a week. I know I need to get medicine to get better. This does not go away magically."
  Ratcliffe also called on the British government to insist his wife was tested for the virus and has asked U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ensure British Iranians held in the prison are diplomatically protected.
