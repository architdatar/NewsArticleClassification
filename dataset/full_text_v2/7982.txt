  The British Prime Minister has ordered the UK to lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.  Calling the virus the “biggest threat” the UK has faced in decades, Boris Johnson said people across the country must “stay home” in order to halt the growth of Covid-19 and protect the health care system.  “Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,” Johnson said in a televised address.  People will be allowed to leave their homes for limited purposes: Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible One form of exercise a day — for example a run, walk, or cycle — alone or with members of your household Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person Traveling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home.  
  “If you don’t follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings,” he said. The measures will be in place for three weeks and then will be reviewed. Watch here:

  4:38 p.m. ET, March 23, 2020 US Supreme Court justices are holding meetings via teleconference From CNN's Ariane De Vogue John Roberts was the only US Supreme Court justice present in the conference room last Friday as the justices “met” for their regular meeting to discuss pending cases.  The other eight justices participated via a teleconference, said Kathy Arberg, the Court's public information officer. It was Roberts’ idea “in accordance with the Center of Disease Control’s guidance on social distancing" for the other justices to work from home, Arberg said. It’s likely that when the justices meet again next Friday, they will continue the same pattern. The news comes as the Court is making changes to grapple with the pandemic.  On Monday, for the first time in a decade, the court released opinions for an argued case without sitting on the bench. They also postponed oral arguments for the next two weeks — something the court has not done since 1918.

  4:05 p.m. ET, March 23, 2020 Clothing and textile manufacturers will deliver face masks to US government this week From CNN's Katelyn Polantz A group of clothing and textile manufacturers, including Hanes, are planning to deliver their first shipments of three-ply face masks to the federal government by midweek to help health care workers respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The largest US yarn spinner, Parkdale Inc., and six other companies planned to begin production of the masks on Monday, according to the National Council of Textile Organizations. The group aims to make up to 10 million masks a week in the US and Central America about a month from now. The coalition of companies, which also includes Fruit of the Loom, Los Angeles Apparel and American Giant, worked with the White House to set up the increased production, the industry group's statement said.  The masks will be sent directly to the federal government, a spokesperson for Hanes said.

  4:04 p.m. ET, March 23, 2020 Plastic surgeons asked to donate equipment and stop elective surgeries From CNN's Jacqueline Howard Plastic surgeons in the United States are being asked to donate their masks, ventilators and other medical supplies and equipment to the nation's coronavirus response efforts. The White House's Covid-19 Task Force and the Federal Emergency Management Agency  plan to route those donated supplies and equipment to hospitals or other temporary medical facilities in need, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons announced on Saturday.  The announcement was made after the group last week had asked plastic surgeons to cease elective surgeries or any nonessential services due to increased risks. According to a statement from the group's president, Dr. Lynn Jeffers, the "White House was in direct contact with ASPS leadership to expand the scope of our clearinghouse and potentially facilitate distribution of supplies and equipment nationwide by the Federal Emergency Management Agency." "Delineating the location of ventilators outside of hospitals is the first urgent need. Hospitals are already facing ventilator shortages and ventilator manufacturing will not meet this need in time," Jeffers said in the statement. "This is urgent, and the need is now."
