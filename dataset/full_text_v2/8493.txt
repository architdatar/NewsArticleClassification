  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s wife has tested positive for COVID-19, the official said in a statement Thursday night.
  Sophie Grégoire Trudeau is in isolation with mild symptoms but is feeling well, the statement said.
  The prime minister will remain in isolation for 14 days. He will not be tested because he is not showing symptoms, according to the statement.
  Trudeau plans to address Canadians Friday.
