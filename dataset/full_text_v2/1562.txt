  The government in North Korea claims there are no cases of COVID-19 in North Korea, according to a state news agency.Â 
  The KCNA agency said in an editorial said officials had increased the amount of public knowledge about the disease but added that this didn't mean people should feel relieved "for having no COVID-19 case in the DPRK,"
  North Korea has further intensified quarantine and medical observation of foreigners entering the country according to the agency, and has freed over 70 foreigners without suspected symptoms from quarantine.
  The top American general in South Korea said Friday, however, he is  fairly certain North Korea has not been spared by the COVID-19 outbreak  that began in neighboring China.
