  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday said it is too early to say if schools will reopen in the fall but that schools and colleges should come up with various alternatives.
  The governor said the state will issue guidelines in June for schools and colleges to prepare for next semester.
  There are 2.6 million students enrolled in K-12 schools and more than 550,000 in public colleges, according to state education  data .
  "To reduce the risk of spread, summer school this year will be conducted through distance learning," the governor said. "Meal programs and child care services for essential employees will continue."
