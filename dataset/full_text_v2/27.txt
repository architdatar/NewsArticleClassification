  Hundreds of people gathered in San Francisco's Chinatown on Saturday to  march against xenophobia  caused by fears of the coronavirus outbreak. 
  Demonstrators carried signs that read "Chinatown open for business" and "United we stand together."
  California Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, tweeted a photo of the gathering, calling coronavirus a "serious public threat" and "not an invitation to racial stereotyping." 
  "Fight the virus not the people," he tweeted.

  In Los Angeles, a group representing Koreatown restaurants said business in general was down about 50 percent in the last week after rumors spread that a Korean Air flight attendant with coronavirus had dined in the neighborhood,  NBC Los Angeles reported. 
  As a result, patrons canceled reservations at some restaurants and others called to check whether it was safe to visit the normally bustling area. Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced Friday that the flight attendant did not have symptoms while in L.A. and did not pose any risk to the general public.
