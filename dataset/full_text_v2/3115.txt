  WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said Friday that despite the recent  emphasis on the need for more coronavirus testing , it was important to recognize that more testing would not be "everything." 
  “The emphasis that we've been hearing is essentially testing is everything and it isn't. It's the kinds of things that we've been doing, the mitigation strategies, that are an important part of that," Fauci said at the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House Friday evening. 
  But Fauci, who said that he thought there would be enough tests available to control the virus, said that just because testing is not a silver bullet does not mean it is unimportant. 
  “I want to make sure that people understand not to underestimate the importance of testing. Testing is a part — an important part — of a multifaceted way that we are going to control and ultimately end this outbreak.”
  Trump was criticized for announcing Thursday a  three-phase plan  to open up the economy without offering any nationwide testing and contact tracing program. Some public health experts have said that testing for the coronavirus would have to be at least  doubled or tripled  from its current levels to allow for even a partial reopening of America's economy.
