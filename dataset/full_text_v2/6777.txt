  Amused locals posted incredulous videos on social media of the long lines of traffic to access their local branches. "All that for some McDonald's," wrote one.Â 
  Josua Haron, 24, went looking for his usual choice of 20 chicken McNuggets after a McDonald's-branded car announced over loudspeaker the reopening his local drive-thru in Moissy-Crayamel, south of Paris.Â He went home empty-handed, though, after learning how long it would take to get to the front of the line.Â "Three hours wait, not for me!" he laughed.Â
