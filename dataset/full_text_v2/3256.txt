  Florida Gov.  Ron DeSantis  on Friday ordered the closing beaches in two counties: Broward and Palm Beach. But without a statewide edict, local authorities have settled on a variety of decisions on how to handle people flooding to their shores. 
  Many counties and cities have outright closed their beaches. Pinellas County — where Clearwater and St. Petersburg are located — was a holdout, but  ordered  its beaches closed before noon on Friday. (Clearwater had already  voted  to close its beaches.)
  Meanwhile, Panama City Beach's chamber of commerce  declared  Thursday that beaches there aren't closed, and the town is "open for business." Beaches in the Florida Keys are also open — but its hotels, guest houses, short-term rentals in RV parks and vacation rentals will be closed to visitors starting Sunday, Monroe county's emergency management department  ordered .
