  A nurse who works all week in Maryland is traveling to New York City to volunteer on weekends.
  “I got interested two weeks ago when the New York governor was asking for help," Bailey Suh, 29, told NBC News. "I wanted to get involved. I felt so guilty. I am a critical care nurse. I want to make a difference, and New York City needs us right now." 
  But she said she has faced some frustration in finding opportunities to volunteer only on weekends.
  Suh said she applied for work in the city all week, but heard from many contract companies that her availability wasn't enough. She works Monday through Friday doing telework research at home in Baltimore.
  She plans to drive up to New York to start a shift with the city's public hospital system next Friday and will work for at least four weekends, Suh said. Though she's eager to help, she said working in New York does scare her due to shortages of personal protective equipment.
  "I talked to my husband about what to do, and I looked over my life insurance policy, just in case …I  am scared of getting sick," she said. "But I need to help. It’s a battle. Soldiers go overseas for the greater good, and that’s what this is.”
