  A second member of the New York Fire Department tested positive for COVID-19, the department said in a statement on Saturday. 
  Due to the positive test results, "the member, and 33 additional Firefighters, will be self-quarantined and the firehouse will be decontaminated." It was not immediately clear which firehouse was affected. 
  The firefighter did not get exposed while on-duty, but through "community exposure" while off the clock, the statement said.
  "While asymptomatic, this member worked three tours in the last week, but did not respond to any medical calls and had no contact with patients," the department added.  
  There are 99 members of the New York Fire Department who are currently self-quarantined.
