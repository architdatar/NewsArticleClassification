  9:13 a.m. ET, April 4, 2020 Atlanta nurse battling coronavirus in NYC: "It's emotionally draining" From CNN's Elise Hammond   courtesy Letha Love 
  Nurses from Atlanta are flying to New York City to help treat coronavirus patients. Letha Love, an Atlanta ICU nurse, said she was shocked by what she saw when she arrived. "I wasn't expecting it to be the amount of people that it was and the severity of it," she told CNN this morning. "To hear the whole hospital calling codes all night, it's emotionally draining." 
  This comes after New York City sent an emergency alert to phones, asking all licensed health care workers to support the city's health facilities. Love said she was originally planning to stay 3 to 6 weeks, but might return to Atlanta earlier. "I do whatever it takes to protect myself so that I can go back to my kids healthy and strong. But this is a lot. It's a lot. And people need to take it serious," she said. Love said most of the patients she has worked with in New York so far have been intubated, but she wants their family members to know that nurses and other health professionals are taking care of them. "We wouldn't come here if we weren't going to take care of them," she said. "We came there to take care of them" New York currently has 103,169 coronavirus cases and 2,935 deaths, according to  Johns Hopkins University .

I have once again transmitted to you the support of the Popular Party for the containment measures against the coronavirus.” The state of alarm involves tight restrictions on movement and allows only essential workers to perform their duties.

  The Netherlands has recorded another 164 coronavirus deaths bringing the country’s total to 1,651 — 904 higher than Friday's total — according to new figures from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment.  The health authority said there have now been 16,627 confirmed coronavirus cases since the outbreak began, although it added that the true number will be higher because not everyone is tested.  Numbers reflect social distancing measures:  The Institute says the numbers reflect the “initial effects” of government-imposed social distancing policies. “The number of patients admitted to hospital, and the number of deceased patients reported in the Netherlands is increasing less rapidly than would have been expected without measures in place,” the Institute said. 
  “It will take a considerable time to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. Everyone must continue to comply with the measures in the coming period," the Institute added.

  Mixed messages on masks:  President Donald Trump said Friday his administration was now recommending Americans wear "non-medical cloth" face coverings, a reversal of previous guidance that suggested masks were unnecessary for people who weren't sick. But Trump said the recommendations, which came after a week of heated deliberations inside the White House, were voluntary and that he would not partake. "I don't think I'm going to be doing it," he said, going on to suggest it was hard to envision such a thing in the Oval Office: "Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens — I just don't see it."

  Germany's coronavirus death toll has risen to 1,158, according to the country’s disease and control agency, the Robert Koch Insititute. The death toll increased by 141 deaths in 24 hours.  There are now 85,778 coronavirus cases in Germany, with the total number of confirmed cases jumping 7% from Friday to Saturday.  Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that there is a “bit of hope” for Germany after figures show that the spread of coronavirus is “a bit slower than it was just a few days ago.” Speaking on video published on the German federal government's YouTube channel, the Chancellor did stress however, that it was “way too early to recognize a definite trend” and “it is far too early to loosen the strict rules.” Merkel, herself now out of isolation, said it would be “absolutely irresponsible” to fix a date for the restrictions to be lifted and warned that Germany would “go from the frying pan into the fire – medically, economically and socially.” Merkel also urged all Germans to avoid traveling around the country during the upcoming Easter period.
