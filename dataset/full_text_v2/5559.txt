  Quest Diagnostics announced Tuesday that its coronavirus antibody tests be will available without a visit to a doctor’s office first. The company started offering antibody tests on April 21, but patients first needed to visit a doctor, who would prescribe the test.
  Consumers who would like a test can sign up through  QuestDirect , an online service that asks individuals a series of questions to determine if they qualify. Each request is reviewed, and if appropriate, an order for the test is issued by a licensed physician. Individuals can then make an appointment at one of Quest’s nationwide labs, where they will be tested. (Quest's antibody test is not an at-home test.)
  Patients will be able to speak to a physician about their results. It’s important to note that it’s unclear at this point whether a  positive antibody test  means that an individual is immune to the coronavirus. A positive test can indicate whether a person has been infected at some point in the past.  
  Quest will be sharing the data collected from its antibody testing with government agencies in an effort to provide a more clear picture of how many people in the U.S. have had the coronavirus.
