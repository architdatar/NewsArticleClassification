  Tripadvisor is laying off 900 employees, or one-quarter of its global workforce, the company announced Tuesday. 
  With hotel vacancy rates running at 100 percent in many parts of the world, and airline booking at record lows, the travel company said it had little option but to reduce headcount. 
  It is also asking some remaining staff to take a temporary 20 percent pay cut and work a four-day week.
  Co-founder and CEO Stephen Kaufer said the company would also close some of its 52 offices around the world, including Boston and San Francisco, and re-evaluate its need for real estate.
  “We have been and will continue to more fully embrace a remote work culture,” Kaufer said in a memo to staff on Tuesday, suggesting the success of work-from-home could affect the company’s future real estate footprint.
