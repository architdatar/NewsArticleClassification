  Most people who have tested positive for coronavirus in New York City are younger than 50, according to figures released by the city Saturday.
  This does not reflect the ages of those who have died, only people confirmed to be infected with the virus.
  Overall, 57 percent of those who have tested positive in the city are 49 or younger. People 18 to 49 years old make up the majority, 54 percent, the city said. The next largest group are those age 50 to 64, who account for 23 percent of positive test results so far.
  The accounting reflects data known to the city through 5:30 p.m. Friday. 
  On Friday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said,  "We are now the epicenter of this crisis"  in the United States.
