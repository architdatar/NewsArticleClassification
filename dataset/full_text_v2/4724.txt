  As of Monday morning, more than 670 Air and Army National Guard have been activated in 15 states, up from 400 in six states as of Friday morning. The vast majority of those activated are in Maryland (1,000) and New York (516).
  All 50 states have declared emergencies - any state that has declared an emergency has the authority to call up the National Guard.
  Most of the National Guard troops are currently assigned to disinfecting/cleaning of public areas, providing transport for health-care workers, providing support at drive-through testing facilities, collecting and delivering samples and delivering food and supplies.
  More than 145 members of the Colorado National Guard who are trained in biological hazards have been activated to help out at drive-through testing facilities throughout the state. On Monday, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan activated 1,000 members of his state’s National Guard. Eight West Virginia National Guard experts in chemical and biological response and civil support are training state first responders from West Virginia and Kentucky on how to mitigate coronavirus exposure.
