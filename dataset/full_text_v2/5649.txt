  Two presumptive positive cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Rhode Island, state officials said Sunday. 
  A resident in his 40s tested positive after traveling to Italy in mid-February, according to the state Health Department. The case still needs to be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the person is being treated at a hospital under infection control protocols.
  A teenager who also traveled to Europe tested positive and is at home with mild symptoms, the Health Department said. A woman in her 30s who has mild symptoms and was on the trip is also being tested.
  The department said the 38 people who traveled to Italy with Saint Raphael Academy were told to stay home and self-monitor for two weeks.
  "We are not seeing widespread community transmission in Rhode Island, and the general level of risk for Rhode Islanders is still low," said Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, the department's director of health.
