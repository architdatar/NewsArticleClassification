  As loved ones gathered on Thursday to  remember the life of George Floyd , whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police  sparked nationwide protests , Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump gave an impassioned plea for America to “not cooperate with evil” but instead continue protesting against it.
  “We cannot cooperate with evil,” he said. “We cannot cooperate with injustice. We cannot cooperate with torture because George Floyd deserved better than that. We all deserve better than that.”
  Crump referred to Floyd’s final moments under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin as “inhumane” and invoked Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s call to action.
  “The plea for justice is simply this,” Crump said. “Dr. Martin Luther King said, ‘he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting is really like cooperating with it.’”
  Crump also reminded mourners that Floyd died not of the current coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than  100,000 people across the country , but instead of the unspoken pandemic generations in the making.
  “I want to make it clear on the record,” Crump said. “It was the other pandemic that we’re far too familiar with here in America. The pandemic of racism and discrimination that killed George Floyd.”
