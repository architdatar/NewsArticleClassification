  New York City crossed yet another tragic milestone on Friday as  health officials estimated  that the COVID-19 death toll had gone past 12,000.
  There have been at least 7,890 confirmed coronavirus-related fatalities in the five boroughs as of 2:30 p.m., according to the city's daily tally. In recent days, the city has started to make public its count of "probable" COVID-19 deaths and that grim number reached at least 4,309 by Friday afternoon.
  Just 24 hours earlier, the totals had been 7,563 confirmed deaths and 3,914 probable fatalities.
