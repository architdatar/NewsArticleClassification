  The Milken Institute Global Conference — an annual event put on by billionaire financier Michael Milken, who was  recently pardoned by President Trump  — will be delayed due to coronavirus fears, according to multiple reports and two sources who spoke to NBC News.
  Originally scheduled to take place May 2 through May 6 at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, the conference nicknamed "Davos of the West" is now delayed until July, said the sources, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the conference.
  The organization says the conference attracts more than 4,000 attendees from 70 countries, including celebrities, politicians, corporate executives, and leaders.
  The Milken Institute did not reply to a request for comment.
