  Stung by seeing one of its Pacific fleet aircraft carriers stuck in Guam with almost 600 coronavirus cases, the US Navy said an Atlantic fleet carrier will extend its time at sea to keep it virus free. The USS Harry S Truman will delay its homecoming to its Norfolk, Virginia, homeport, after a deployment to the Middle East, Navy officials said. The carrier, which left on its current deployment in November, will complete what the Navy calls the “sustainment” phase of its operation at sea, the officials said. Sustainment, during which the ship can quickly get underway to respond to any emergency, is normally conducted pierside, so sailors can get some time ashore with families and friends. “The Navy is taking this measure to maintain the strike group’s warfighting capability while ensuring the safety of the crew,” the Navy statement said. “In the face of COVID-19, we need to protect our most valuable asset, our people, by keeping the ship out to sea,” Vice Adm. Andrew Lewis, commander of the US 2nd Fleet, said in the statement. 
  In a Facebook posting, Rear Adm. Andrew Loiselle, commander of the Truman’s carrier strike group, told families of the crew that he would update them on the status of the deployment in three weeks. Loiselle said he was certain there were no coronavirus cases among the approximately 5,000 sailors on the Truman or the crews of its escort ships. “It has been over 40 days since our last port call, and no one has been allowed to come aboard our ships since then, so we are sure we are COVID-free,” Loiselle said. 
  Meanwhile in Guam, the Navy reported the first death among the nearly 600 sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt who tested positive for the coronavirus. Read more here:

  12:14 a.m. ET, April 14, 2020 A teenager tried to smuggle his friend inside a suitcase to get around India's lockdown From CNN's Swati Gupta in New Delhi A 17-year-old boy has been caught trying to smuggle his friend into his home inside a suitcase to get around lockdown rules in India. The incident occurred in the city of Mangalore in the southern state of Karnataka, where the building association of the boy's home has banned outsiders to restrict the spread of coronavirus.  The boy and his friend were detained by local police. The teenager was bored and tried to get his friend into the housing complex in the luggage -- but residents suspected something and caught them, said N. Vishwanath, an official with Mangalore police.  India initiated a nationwide lockdown last month to control the outbreak of the virus and many residential associations have issued tough restrictive orders on outsiders entering the premises.  After the residents called the police, the two boys were taken to the nearest police station where they were let off with a warning. “There was no complaint registered since they are just students,” said Vishwanath.  Karnataka has registered 247 confirmed coronavirus cases, including six deaths.

  11:34 p.m. ET, April 13, 2020 A group of pastors is suing California's governor over restrictions on religious gatherings From CNN's Jon Passantino California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks at a news briefing in Rancho Cordova, California on April 9.  Rich Pedroncelli/Pool/AP 
  A group of Southern California pastors is suing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and several other officials in federal court over health directives that have prevented worshipers from attending church services due to the coronavirus pandemic. The suit was filed Monday in the US District Court for the Central District of California by the Dhillon Law Group, which is led by Harmeet Dhillion -- a Republican Party official -- on behalf of four plaintiffs, three of whom are pastors. The plaintiffs include: Dean Moffatt , a pastor at an Indio church who alleges he was fined $1,000 for holding a church service on Palm Sunday Brenda Wood , a pastor at a Riverside church Patrick Scales , a pastor at a Fontana church Wendy Gish , a member of Scales’ church 
  The group argues in the suit that Newsom and other state officials “in a gross abuse of their power, have seized the coronavirus pandemic to expand their authority by unprecedented lengths, depriving plaintiffs and all other residents of California of fundamental rights protected by the US and California Constitutions, including freedom of religion, speech, and assembly, and due process and equal protection under the law.” 
  Newsom’s office did not immediately return a CNN request for comment. The church leaders in the lawsuit are also suing state Attorney General Xavier Becerra and several Riverside and San Bernardino county officials, including the sheriffs and health officers. Orders ignored:  On March 19, Newsom issued the first statewide stay-home order in the US, urging California’s nearly 40 million residents to remain home to reduce the spread of the virus, and closing all non-essential businesses. Despite the orders, some congregations have continued to meet, including in Sacramento County, where 71 people connected to a single church were later infected with the coronavirus in one of the largest outbreak clusters in the country. Electronic worship:  The suit comes after Dhillon sent a letter last week to San Bernardino County officials demanding it loosen restrictions around church gatherings following its order that all religious ceremonies be held electronically. Violating the order was punishable by a $1,000 fine or up to 90 days imprisonment. But after the letter, the county issued a “clarification” allowing for in-person church services “if they choose to do so and make every effort to prevent contact between congregants.”  Praying safely:  On Friday, Newsom also addressed church gatherings ahead of Easter, saying those planning to worship could continue to do so in a safe manner. “As you pray, move your feet at least six feet apart from someone else,” he said. “Practice your faith, but so in a way that allows you to keep yourself healthy, keep others healthy.”

  11:15 p.m. ET, April 13, 2020 New Zealand extends its state of emergency for another 7 days Authorities in New Zealand have extended the country's state of national emergency for another seven days in order to support the government's efforts to combat the spread of Covid-19. The initial declaration was made on March 25, and today's extension is the third of its kind. The seven-day declaration can be extended as many times as necessary, Minister of Civil Defense Peeni Henare said in a statement. The state of emergency provides those managing the response in an emergency the ability to access powers they would not normally have, but might require now to implement and enforce these measures, "including managing roads, traffic and public places; providing first aid, food, shelter and accommodation," Henare said. New Zealand has reported 1,366 coronavirus cases and nine Covid-19 related fatalities, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

  Here's what you need to know: Global cases near 2 million:  The novel coronavirus has infected at least 1,918,855 people and killed 119,588   worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 581,000 patients have been identified in the US, including over 23,600 deaths New York preparing for what's next:  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday that "the worst is over" in his state, but that people need to continue to be smart going forward and practice social distancing. Cuomo said the state is looking at a plan to reopen after the shutdown that is in coordination with other surrounding states. Heated briefing:  President Donald Trump  lashed out at criticism of his handling of the  coronavirus crisis  during a grievance-fueled appearance from the White House that featured a propaganda-like video he said was produced by his aides. "Everything we did was right,"  Trump insisted .  Census delay:  Trump also said he will ask for  a delay to the 2020 Census  to make sure it is  completed safely and accurately.  The data gleaned from the census, which is conducted every 10 years, is used to apportion members of Congress among the states, as well as the data that states use to draw congressional districts. Semblance of normalcy in Spain:  Around 300,000 nonessential workers are estimated to have gone back to their jobs in Spain's Madrid region on Monday as the country began a partial  lifting of lockdown restrictions  aimed at curbing the spread of  coronavirus , a spokesperson for Madrid's regional government  told CNN . Singapore's biggest spike:  The Southeast Asian city-state reported 386 new cases on Monday -- all locally transmitted. It's the largest single-day increase since the outbreak began in the country, according to the Ministry of Health. Malaysia is running out of PPE:  The country will run out of personal protective equipment for frontline medical workers in two weeks unless it can purchase more or receives donations, the health ministry's director-general said.

  10:51 p.m. ET, April 13, 2020 The creator of an influential coronavirus model says the US can stop transmission this summer From CNN Health’s Arman Azad The creator of an influential coronavirus model, Dr. Christopher Murray, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Monday that the country can essentially stop coronavirus transmission this summer. “The one thing we absolutely know for sure is that social distancing measures work,” said Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “It leads to a situation where every case is infecting less than one other case, and that means if you keep the course, you’ll get transmission essentially down to zero.” 
  Murray said that’s happening in Italy and China and there’s “no reason it wouldn’t work here.” Murray’s model, which is often cited by the White House, assumes that social distancing will continue through May. But experts have pushed back on the model’s assumption that states can prevent any resurgence of the virus once those measures are lifted.  Watch his interview below:

  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed several executive orders Monday, ordering several types of businesses to remain closed to the public for the time being. The orders will impact restaurants -- which are limited to carry-out and delivery orders only -- bars, gyms, theaters, casinos and other places of "public accommodation," and will remain in place until April 30.  "By extending these Executive Orders, we ensure that our state continues to do all it can to suppress the spread of COVID-19 by limiting in-person interactions and services as much as possible right now, while also ensuring that vital goods and supplies get to the people who need them most as quickly and safely as possible," Whitmer said in a statement. 
  Whitmer's office also announced an executive order tasking the Michigan Liquor Control Commission with initiating a spirits buy-back program, in the hopes it would offer financial relief to bars and restaurants. “Michigan’s 8,500 on-premises liquor licensees continue to make unprecedented sacrifices to help slow the spread of COVID-19 across our state,” she   said. “This buy-back program will help our bars and restaurants critical to Michigan’s economy weather the storm through this challenging time in our history.”
