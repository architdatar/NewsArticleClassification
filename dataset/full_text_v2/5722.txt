  Sen. Bernie Sanders, campaigning in South Carolina ahead of the Democratic primary there, slammed President Trump for coming down to the state for a Friday evening rally amid the outbreak. Gary Grumbach, one of our campaign embeds, is with the Sanders campaign today:
  Sen.  @berniesanders  is not thrilled  @realDonaldTrump  is coming down to Charleston tonight for a  #KAG  Rally. “Hey Mr. Trump, why don't you worry about the coronavirus rather than disrupting the democratic primary right here in South Carolina,” he said in St. George.  pic.twitter.com/c2LvZWTnYk
