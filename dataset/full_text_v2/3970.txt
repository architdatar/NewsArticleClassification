  Israel will be closing "all unnecessary institutions like restaurants and coffee shops" in an effort to halt all leisure activities starting Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a press conference on Saturday.
  All supermarkets and pharmacies will stay open in an effort to avoid food and medicine shortages, he said.
  Banking services are expected to continue as usual, and gas stations will remain open.
  Netanyahu also advised people to keep two meters away from one another and encouraged anyone who doesn't need to go to work to stay home.
