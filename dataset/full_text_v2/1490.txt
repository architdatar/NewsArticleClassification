  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will extend a nationwide lockdown to tackle the spread of  coronavirus , the chief minister of Delhi state said on Saturday, without disclosing how long the extension would be for.
  Earlier in the day, Modi held a video conference call with several state ministers to decide on the future course of the current 21-day lockdown, which had been set to end on Tuesday.
  Several Indian states have urged Modi to extend the lockdown, even amid rising concerns that the restrictions had put millions of poor people out of work and forced an exodus of migrant workers from cities to villages.
