  WASHINGTON — With Iowa's congressional primary elections one day away, Democratic groups are spending big money to help Democrat Theresa Greenfield over the finish line. 
  Greenfield has some big names in her corner — the DSCC, NARAL, EMILY's List, the Brady PAC, BOLD PAC and former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack are among her backers. And some of her key allies are flooding the airwaves ahead of Tuesday's Senate primary, where Democrats look to find their nominee to face off against Republican Sen. Joni Ernst. 
  In the past seven days, Women Vote! (a PAC aligned with EMILY's List), Senate Majority PAC and Greenfield’s campaign have spent almost $1.8 million on TV, Advertising Analytics shows. Greenfield's top opponents, Michael Franken and Eddie Mauro, have spent just $165,000 combined.
  In the two Women Vote! ads captured by Advertising Analytics, the PAC takes aim at  both Franken  and  Mauro , framing Franken as a carpetbagger and Mauro as not adequately supportive of abortion rights. 
  Mauro's recent ads have  taken aim at Greenfield's business record , but his spending has been just a drop in the bucket when compared to the pro-Greenfield spending. 
  Franken's  ad messaging  has centered on his Des Moines Register endorsement and his biography, and don't take jabs at his opponents. 
  The big spending and influx of attack ads aimed at boosting Greenfield come in a race that has an uncommon wrinkle — if no candidate reaches 35 percent of the vote on Tuesday, the party will choose its nominee at its convention.
  So Greenfield and her allies are trying to flood the zone in the race’s final days in the hopes of wrapping things up for good on Tuesday.
