  The Food and Drug Administration has released  guidelines  for manufacturers to develop kits for consumers to collect samples at home to be sent off to labs for COVID-19 testing. Currently, one kit, made by LabCorp, is authorized for at-home collection. 
  On Wednesday, the FDA wrote on its website that it is supportive of at-home self-collection, provided there is data  "data and science to support consumer safety and test accuracy."
  Such kits would provide swabs, tubes and other tools necessary to ship specimens to a lab for analysis.
  The move is meant to greatly expand the number of people able to be tested for the coronavirus.
