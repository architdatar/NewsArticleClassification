  Wynn Resorts CEO Matt Maddox said Sunday that the  Las Vegas Strip  could reopen late next month with extensive safety measures in place, including thermal cameras and social distancing requirements at the company’s hotels.
  In a report published on the company’s website, Maddox said parts of the state’s economy could reopen earlier in May with reduced occupancy, mask requirements, temperature checks and a ban on large gatherings.
  If virus-related benchmarks like increased testing capacity are met, he said, the Las Vegas Strip could potentially reopen in mid to late May.
  “I understand that if we incrementally reopen, we might have to pull back if a spike in cases occurs that jeopardizes our healthcare system capacity,” he said. “However, the only way to cross this river is one stone at a time.”
