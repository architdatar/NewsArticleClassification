  3:13 a.m. ET, March 26, 2020 UN warns that coronavirus could do "potentially catastrophic" damage in prisons From CNN's Radina Gigova in Atlanta In this February 26, 2013 file photo, inmates walk through the exercise yard at California State Prison Sacramento, near Folsom, California.

  As the coronavirus begins to strike in prisons and detention centers, the UN is urging governments “not to forget those behind bars” and protect the staff members working in those facilities.  “Governments are facing huge demands on resources in this crisis and are having to take difficult decisions," said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet in a statement Wednesday.  "But I urge them not to forget those behind bars, or those confined in places such as closed mental health facilities, nursing homes and orphanages, because the consequences of neglecting them are potentially catastrophic." 
  She laid out measures that authorities could take:  They could reduce the number of people in detention and examine ways to release particularly vulnerable detainees, like those who are older or already sick. Authorities overseeing these facilities should continue providing for the specific health-care needs of women prisoners, including those who are pregnant, and those of inmates with disabilities and juvenile detainees, Bachelet added. If prisons restrict visits for inmates, they should set up alternative measures like video conferencing or increased phone calls with family members, she said. Prisoners' rights need to be protected,  she emphasized. Anti-pandemic measures should not undermine the fundamental rights of detained people, including their rights to adequate food and water, and access to a lawyer and doctor.

  2:59 a.m. ET, March 26, 2020 This artist drew Wuhan under quarantine in January. A new cartoon shows hope and recovery From CNN's Yuli Yang  Credit: Chen Xiaotao Momo 
  Back in January, when the coronavirus outbreak was triggering massive lockdowns and dramatic emergency measures in China, artist Chen Xiaotao Momo drew a cartoon that quickly became popular on Chinese social media. In the sketch, a bowl of "hot dry noodles" -- signature dish of Wuhan, the city at ground zero of the pandemic -- sits in a hospital bed with a face mask and teary eyes. At the window, regional cuisines representing different parts of China hold signs expressing encouragement and support. Wuhan was the first Chinese city to go under lockdown. Two months later, the worst of the pandemic appears to have passed in mainland China. Lockdowns and restrictions are slowly lifting, and provincial alert levels are being cautiously lowered. In a new cartoon, published by Chen yesterday, the bowl of noodles is no longer in bed. Instead the Wuhan dish waves happily to the crowd of food friends outside the window, which appears to include Sichuan hot pot and southern Chinese dim sum, among others. They appear to be cheering, "Hubei restart," referring to the hard-hit province of which Wuhan is the capital. The cartoon has circulated widely in the past day -- the hashtag  #HotDryNoodlesHasWokenUp  is trending on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, with more than 210 million views.

  Three cruise ships off the coast of Western Australia have been told that under no circumstances will they be allowed to dock. The Artania  is carrying 800 passengers, mostly Germans, seven of whom have the coronavirus.  “The Artania cruise ship must continue on its journey to South Africa urgently. This ship needs to leave immediately,” Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan told reporters Thursday. He said if the seven passengers needed urgent medical assistance they should be sent to an Australian Defence Force base, then flown home to Germany. “We are working with the Australian government to do this immediately,” he said. 
  The MSC Magnifica  has refueled in Fremantle and remains in waters off the coast of Western Australia. It had been planning to end its voyage in Dubai, and was at sea when its operator, MSC Cruises, temporarily halted its fleet.  MSC Cruises told CNN on March 23 that no passengers were ill. “Nobody on board -- passengers or crew -- has fever, signs of respiratory insufficiency or gastroenteric diseases,” it said in a statement. 
  The Vasco da Gama  is carrying around 800 Australians, including 200 Western Australians, 109 New Zealanders, and 33 UK citizens and other foreigners, according to the WA government. It had been due to dock in Fremantle on Friday but has been requested to postpone its arrival until Monday to allow for the preparation of temporary accommodation on Rottnest Island.  The island, a protected nature reserve, will be used to house Western Australians onboard the ship for their 14-day quarantine period. Others onboard must remain on the ship until provisions are made to send them straight home.  No repeat:  The Western Australian government is trying to avoid the scenario that played out in Sydney on March 19, when more than 2,600 passengers were allowed to leave the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Since then, 121 passengers have been confirmed to have Covid-19, according to the New South Wales Health Department. “We are not going to have a Sydney Harbor fiasco on our watch,” McGowan said.

  2:26 a.m. ET, March 26, 2020 Fact Check: The US has done more coronavirus tests than South Korea, but not per person President Donald Trump  claimed  today the US had done more coronavirus testing than any other nation, after receiving domestic criticism over the rate of testing. "In fact, over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span," Trump  tweeted . Fact check:   While the US has overtaken South Korea in total numbers of coronavirus tests administered, it has conducted far fewer tests per capita, given the US population is more than six times larger than South Korea's. "Yes, it is true that South Korea has run less tests as an absolute number. However, it is important to point out the huge difference in the population sizes," Aubree Gordon, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, told CNN. South Korea  has a population of 51 million, and has conducted 357,896 tests so far, according to government figures.  That means one in every 142 South Koreans have been tested. The US  has a population of 329 million and has conducted  418,810 tests  so far, according to the  Covid Tracking Project .  That means one in every 785 Americans have been tested.

  1:44 a.m. ET, March 26, 2020 Tokyo's streets are full of people, a day after the governor urged social distancing From CNN's Will Ripley Commuters wearing face masks make their way to work on March 26 in Tokyo, Japan.  Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images 
  Yesterday, the governor of Tokyo held an emergency news conference urging citizens to  stay at home and avoid going out unnecessarily. Today, it appears residents are ignoring the warnings. Streets around the Meguro River are packed with people gathering to view the blooming cherry blossoms. Some are wearing masks, but just as many people aren't.  It's cherry blossom season -- meaning all week, people have been going to parks and public areas, picnicking outdoors, and gathering in large numbers. Authorities are urging citizens not to take the pandemic lightly -- Japan reported its largest single-day jump in cases yesterday --  but their pleas for social distancing appear to have had little effect.
