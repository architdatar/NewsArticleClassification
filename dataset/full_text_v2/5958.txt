  6:51 a.m. ET, March 27, 2020 Chinese government investigating test kit maker which supplied Spain From Shanshan Wang in Beijing, Max Ramsay in London, Ingrid Formanek, Laura Perez-Maestro, and Al Goodman in Spain, and Mia Alberti in Lisbon A Chinese government regulatory group said on Friday it has launched an investigation into Covid-19 test kit maker which supplied test kits to Spain that were recalled. On Thursday, the Spanish government said it was recalling 9,000 kits after finding the results to be “unreliable.” The tests, made by the Chinese company "Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology" were bought "some weeks ago" through a Spanish supplier that imported them from China, the Spanish government said in a statement sent to CNN. When the equipment was tested by Spanish authorities before being put into use, they didn't meet quality levels. Obviously there was an obligation to return the batches and the supplier is going to change them,” Spanish health ministry official Fernando Simón said at the government’s daily coronavirus briefing. “Also, the health ministry is exploring other providers to provide rapid tests", he said. 
  The Shenzhen Market Supervisions Administration said on its Weibo account Friday it has launched an investigation into Bioeasy. Bioeasy posted a statement on its WeChat account Friday to say that the nasopharyngeal swab samples might have been sampled, extracted and handled without strictly following the company's instructions, reducing the accuracy of the tests. Bioeasy added that it didn’t communicate instructions well with customers.

  6:26 a.m. ET, March 27, 2020 Communications issue prevented UK from joining EU ventilator scheme From CNN's Sarah Dean in London The UK did not take part in the EU’s scheme to acquire extra ventilators during the coronavirus pandemic because of an “issue in terms of communication,” according to UK Business Minister Alok Sharma. Responding to British media reports, Sharma told the BBC’s Radio 4 on Friday:  The tendering process on those schemes had already started… If there are future schemes we will absolutely look to see if we will be joining them.”

  He said the UK has its own “ventilator challenge,” which has seen around 3,000 companies respond with offers to help.  On Wednesday, James Dyson, the founder of British technology company Dyson, confirmed to employees in a letter shared with CNN that it had received an order from the UK government for  10,000 new ventilators  to support efforts by the NHS to treat the growing number of patients who have contracted coronavirus.

  Asked about Dyson-produced ventilators being in use by next month, Sharma said Dyson or any other company will need to meet the regulatory requirements before newly acquired ventilators are put into use in the National Health Service (NHS). Pressed on the timescale, Sharma said: “What we want to see is prototypes coming forward in a matter of weeks before we move into large scale production.” He said although the government is trying to move at pace, “the critical point is to make sure that any machines that come forward actually meet the requirements and are safe”.

  5:36 a.m. ET, March 27, 2020 Italian financial police seize 900 unauthorized coronavirus test kits From Valentina DiDonato in Rome Police in the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria have seized 900 unauthorized coronavirus test kits for failing to have validation and certification. The kits were seized as part of checks to identify cases of commercial fraud or fraudulent rises in the prices of medical services during the pandemic, financial police said.  Checks found that some people had already made bank transfers to buy the uncertified products online -- however, the police seized the kits before they were delivered. The sale to unsuspecting and vulnerable citizens of devices for which efficacy has not been proven in any way, seriously endangers public health and safety given that any negative response of the test could hypothetically contribute to the spread of the virus,” a statement from the financial police said.
