  Storm winds from Hurricane Laura toppled a controversial confederate statue in Lake Charles, Louisiana Thursday morning.
  The fate of the South's Defenders Memorial Monument, which stood on the grounds of the county courthouse, was voted on by the Calcasieu Parish Police Jury two weeks ago.
  A vote of 10-4 allowed the statue to remain standing, but storm winds caused the statue of a Confederate soldier to fall from its pedestal onto the ground below.
  “Well, Laura did one good thing while in town,” wrote Bailey Stark, who posted photos of the fallen statue on Facebook.
  The statue has stood in Lake Charles since 1915.
