  12:28 p.m. ET, March 27, 2020 House will say GOP congressman doesn’t have the second to request a roll call vote From CNN's Manu Raju  The House will say GOP Rep. Thomas Massie does not have a sufficient second to request a roll call vote, according to three sources familiar with the matter.  Members still had to return to the Capitol because they need to establish a quorum to do this. Members are sitting in the upstairs gallery to ensure they have enough for a quorum and to maintain social distancing Massie needs one-fifth of the members to rise and be counted to get a sufficient second for a roll call. That won’t happen, sources said. This is highly unusual, sources said, to say a member doesn’t have enough for a second. What this is about:  Massie tweeted that he will seek a recorded vote, meaning that members would be required to show up in person and vote on the historic stimulus bill.  Leadership has hoped to pass the measure by a voice-vote.

  1:42 p.m. ET, March 27, 2020 England's chief medical officer says he has coronavirus symptoms From CNN's Jo Shelley in London  England's Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images 
  England's Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty has coronavirus symptoms and is self-isolating at home, he tweeted on Friday. "After experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 last night, in line with the guidance, I will be self-isolating at home for the next seven days. I will be continuing to advise the Government on the medical response to Coronavirus, supported by my deputies," Whitty tweeted. 
  The news comes just hours after the UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced they had also tested  positive for the coronavirus . With three of the key people in charge of the UK's response to the pandemic now infected by the virus, it raises the question of how many more people at the top of the British government have been affected. Johnson had been criticized for continuing to shake people's hands in public while government advice was to keep around two meters away from other people. The Prime Minister, Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance had also been giving regular in-person news conferences to journalists until Tuesday. Neil Ferguson, a top UK government adviser on the virus, said he believed he had been infected just over a week ago, warning: "There is a lot of Covid-19 in Westminster." Prince Charles , the heir to the British throne, also tested positive for coronavirus this week.

  12:24 p.m. ET, March 27, 2020 A temporary mortuary will be built at Birmingham Airport in UK From CNN's Sarah Dean in London  Work has started on creating a temporary morgue at Birmingham Airport in central England "in preparation for a predicted rise in the number of fatalities from coronavirus," the area's West Midlands police said in a statement on Friday.  The site will initially be able to accommodate 1,500 deaths, but will expand to hold more, and could ultimately hold all deaths across the West Midlands region including those not related to coronavirus, the statement said. “Birmingham Airport can confirm that it is working with the authorities to provide land and a hangar for a temporary mortuary site at the Elmdon side of Birmingham Airport, to support with the Covid-19 pandemic," a Birmingham Airport spokesperson said.  Authorities say they will do everything they can to accommodate different religious requirements, and are working with faith leaders and religious groups.  “We understand that it is a very difficult time for everyone and we will do all that we can to make sure bereaved families understand what is happening to their loved ones and to release them for funeral as soon as we can," senior Birmingham coroner Louise Hunt said.
