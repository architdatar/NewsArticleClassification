  Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Disneyland Paris Resort will close through the end of the month, and Disney Cruise Line will suspend all new departures through the same time period over fears of the spread of the novel coronavirus.
  The resorts will be closed starting Monday. The suspension of cruise departures will take place Saturday.
  "The Walt Disney Company will pay its cast members during that closure period," a company spokesperson said. The hotels and retail and dining complexes will remain open. The Walt Disney Company is also asking employees at its U.S. properties who able to work from home to do so.
  The move comes after previous announcements that Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure  would close  beginning Saturday morning.
