  There are a few things parents should consider before expanding a family's social circle during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the prevalence of cases in their community, said a pediatrics professor at John Hopkins University School of Medicine. "A lot of this is coming down to individual people's risk tolerance," Dr. Aaron Milstone said Wednesday during a virtual discussion hosted by JHU. 
  Milstone said that if a child wants to socialize with other kids in the neighborhood, it's important for their parents to know the prevalence of the virus in their area. "They have to think of it as cobweb or this network that has lots of tentacles, and if you bring in one new person, you're also bringing in all the people that those people are exposed to," Milstone said. He encouraged parents to have conversation with other parents about health safety to make sure their priorities align. Families should also continue practicing social distancing even when interacting with others, They should wear masks when gathering indoors, and continue to follow good hygiene practices.

  Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt is scheduled to visit the White House on Thursday, two sources familiar with the meeting tell CNN.  The governor's spokesperson described the meeting as a discussion on “how to continue to partner with the federal government to help Oklahoma’s economy and get small businesses back on their feet.” Oklahoma small business owners will also be in attendance, according to a White House official.  Some context:  The meeting comes days ahead of  President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa  on Saturday — his first large-scale event since the coronavirus pandemic brought American life to a standstill.  The director of the Tulsa Health Department said he wishes Trump would postpone the rally, citing  concerns about a recent increase  in local cases of Covid-19. But a judge on Tuesday  denied  an emergency motion to stop the rally. That lawsuit was filed on behalf of a series of community groups and two specific individuals, who the attorneys describe as particularly vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19.

  White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany would not directly answer when asked if President Trump or the White House would take responsibility if attendees catch coronavirus during a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma set to be held Saturday.  McEnany got into an extended exchange with CNN’s Jim Acosta, but never responded directly to the question.  “The campaign has taken certain measures to make sure this is a safe rally, temperature checks, hand sanitizers, and masks,” McEnany said during a press briefing Wednesday. “We are taking precautions.  CNN reported that attendees of Trump's upcoming rally  must agree not to sue  the campaign if they contract coronavirus. Rallygoers are asked to RSVP to gain admission to the event and by registering, they must agree to a disclaimer that states they acknowledge the "inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present." Asked by Acosta if attendees would be required to wear masks, McEnany said they will not be required.   “They will be given a mask, it’s up to them whether to make that decision,” she said, adding that, “CDC guidelines are recommended, but not required,” and that it was a “personal choice of individuals.”  McEnany then accused the media of a lack of “internal coherence,” for not asking the same questions of the protesters who came out across the country after the death of George Floyd.  Acosta pointed out that they were marching against injustice, racism, and police brutality, not attending a political rally, and again asked if the President or White House would take responsibility if people get sick.  McEnany deflected, attacked health experts who came out in support of the protests, and reiterated that the campaign has taken “certain measures to make sure this is a safe rally.”  Asked later by another reporter if the White House position was that outdoor events and indoor events carry the same risk for coronavirus, McEnany said that it’s the White House position that “the media should not be making decisions about their guidelines to us about social distancing based on political ideology.”

  The Secretary of Higher Education in New Jersey today released guidance for colleges and universities to reopen for in-person instruction for the upcoming summer and fall sessions.  Here's what's in the guidance:  Cleaning and social distancing:  The guidance requires institutions to observe social distancing of six feet, hand washing, cleaning and disinfection, and must have procedures in place to accommodate individuals with symptoms or a positive Covid-19 diagnosis. Mask wearing:  Institutions must require face masks in all indoor spaces, except when doing so would be bad for an individual's health.   Dorms:  A limited number of students will be allowed to return to residential facilities, but institutions need to develop quarantine and isolation protocols for residents and all common areas in buildings must remain closed. Schools are also asked to prioritize on campus housing for the students for whom it’s most necessary.  Dining:  Campus dining and campus transportation will be required to abide by the state-issued reopening guidelines.  Classes:  Institutions can have instruction that occurs completely outdoors as long as they are abiding by state-established restrictions.  Testing:  College and universities will be responsible for establishing their own testing protocols, working with local health officials.  
  “Colleges this fall and summer will not look the same as they did last year,” New Jersey Higher Education Secretary Dr. Zakiya Smith Ellis said Wednesday.    Schools must submit their restart plans to the office of the Secretary of Higher Education at least 14 days before any staff or students return to campus.
