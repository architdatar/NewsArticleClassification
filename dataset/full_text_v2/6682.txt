  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said on MSNBC Wednesday that adherence to five principles could help stop coronavirus surges happening in states.  The principles are: Universal wearing of masks Avoiding crowds  Physical distancing of at least six feet Typical hand hygiene  Avoiding bars or closing them where possible 
  Looking back on the Southern states that have already experienced resurgences, Fauci said, there was an increase in the percent positive of tests being done, which is “surefire indication that you are in a process where you’re heading towards a resurgence.”  He said that they were starting to see that in some states now, such as Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio and Indiana.  Fauci added that he and other members of the White House coronavirus task force made the point on the weekly call with governors that “it is very important to get ahead of the curve, because what we are seeing now it what actually took place a couple of weeks ago.” “If we don’t start initiating rather strict adherence to the five principles I just mentioned,” Fauci said, “what inevitably is going to happen is that the states that are not yet in trouble will likely get into trouble." 
  “If you’re not getting your arms around and suppressing that surge that’s coming up, that’s just a little bit below the radar screen, before you know it, two to three weeks down the pike, you’re in trouble," he added.

  2:14 p.m. ET, July 29, 2020 Rhode Island delays moving to next phase of reopening due to Covid-19 spread from parties  From CNN's Melissa Alonso  Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said her state "cannot move forward to phase four" due to the spread of coronavirus from parties.    She said contacting tracing shows "we're partying too much, social gatherings are too large," during a weekly coronavirus briefing on Wednesday.   Raimondo announced Rhode Island will remain in phase three for another month, with a change; social gathering limits will be lowered from 25 to 15 people.   "We have cases traced back to a house party, with more than 50 people, and no one wearing a mask," she said.  The governor's listing of other gatherings with Covid-19 cases included a baby shower, several a large birthday parties and pool parties.  "In each of these instances, the patterns are exactly the same, people who know each other, friends and family, more than 25 people, not wearing masks, in close contact for hours," Raimondo said. There have been up to seven to 10 cases found for each of the parties, in some cases, she said.    
  Raimondo pleaded for residents "to knock it off, because people are getting sick people are dying, and it's unnecessary."

  2:35 p.m. ET, July 29, 2020 Medical group warns US must control pandemic now, or risk seeing deaths surge From CNN's Maureen Chowdhury  
  The US could see coronavirus related deaths skyrocket “well into the multiple hundreds of thousands” if there is not a course correction,  according to a warning  from the Association of American Medical Colleges. “We’re not on a good path at present,” AAMC chief scientific officer Dr. Ross McKinney Jr. told CNN’s Brianna Keilar. McKinney also said that the crisis is putting a strain on hospitals, especially those in virus hotspots like Arizona, Florida and Texas. “The crisis is terrible for hospitals. We’re hearing, some of our hospitals in areas like southern Florida, that in fact, they’re full, but their staff is getting sick. As their staff gets sick, there’s nobody there to be able to fill in. So, people are having to work extraordinarily long hours and as you get more tired you end up taking more risks, just because you make mistakes. So we are really, pushing at the limits of what are health system can deliver… We are really hitting at the limit and as disease hits the staff it’s becoming even more of a crisis than it already was,” he said. 
  The  AAMC is calling for  an increase in critical supplies, as well as improving testing, reopening schools safely, expanding health insurance and developing a vaccination distribution protocol.  The association is urging the Trump administration to invoke the Defense Production Act to address supply shortages. “Essentially everywhere is short of the critical supplies and we as a country have not attempted, systematically, to upgrade our production of either PPE or of the supplies that are needed by the laboratories in order to meet the demands we have for testing. The demands we have for PPE,” McKinney said. McKinney added, that the AAMC is calling for national standards for local stay-at-home orders and reopening protocols.  Each city or state “don’t necessarily have to have the same degree of lockdown, but they should use the same criteria to try and move from one phase to the next, so that we can learn what are the best standards to use, so we don’t get these continuous waves of infection,” he said.

  The US Open Championship will be held without fans at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York, on Sept. 14 to 20, Gov.

  The United States Golf Association (USGA) will have protocols — like social distancing, the use of face coverings, cleaning and testing — in place to protect players and staff, a statement released by the governor’s office outlined.    "We are very grateful to Governor Cuomo and his team for their collaboration over the past few months. We are very proud to give our competitors and champions the opportunity to chase their dreams at the U.S. Open to Winged Foot Golf Club in September. While we will miss having fans on-site, we know this is the right decision to make for the players and the community," USGA CEO Mike Davis said in the governor's office statement.

  1:24 p.m. ET, July 29, 2020 Fauci on video with false coronavirus claims: "We've got to follow the science" From CNN's Gisela Crespo Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday "we've got to follow the science" when asked about a viral video that promoted false coronavirus claims.   The video included  false claims about masks and hydroxychloroquine . Versions of it were shared by President Trump on Twitter.  Speaking during an interview on MSNBC, Fauci said that amid the spread of misinformation, it's important to "follow the science."   "I'm very explicit and unambiguous when we say we've got to follow the science. If a study that's a good study comes out and shows efficacy and safety for hydroxychloroquine or any other drug that we do — if you do it in the right way you accept the scientific data. But right now today, the cumulative scientific data that has been put together and done over a number of different studies has shown no efficacy," Fauci explained.  
  "When there's a video out there from a bunch of people spouting something that isn't true, the only recourse you have is to be very, very clear in presenting the scientific data that essentially contradicts that," Fauci told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell.
