  Many parts of India are now under less severe lockdown measures as the country today entered the third extension of nationwide restrictions designed to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. In a statement issued Friday, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced that a further lockdown extension of two weeks will be in place until May 17, with a significant ease in restrictions.  The Indian government has divided the country into zones -- red, orange and green -- depending on the status of the cases registered.  Most restrictions in place across India for the last six weeks will be eased for cities and towns falling into the green zone.  However, limited activities will continue to be prohibited across the country.  This includes: Travel by air, rail, metro and inter-state movement by road. All schools and colleges will continue to remain closed along with any theaters, malls and places of worship.  The Ministry of Home Affairs will allow movement of people by air, rail and road only for select purposes. 
  Metropolitan cities such as  New Delhi ,  Mumbai ,  Bengaluru  and  Pune  have been classified as  red zones . The classification of these regions will be evaluated every week. In Delhi, all government and private offices will be allowed to open, but private offices will be working at 33% capacity. All educational institutes, hotels, malls, movie theaters and public transport will continue to be closed, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a news briefing Sunday. “Coronavirus is here and it is here to stay. That it will go away or we won’t have patients infected with it -- that will never happen. It is not happening anywhere in the world. It is not possible. We have to prepare and learn to live with coronavirus,” said Kejriwal.  
  The Ministry of Home Affairs has asked state governments to issue orders prohibiting gatherings of more than four people from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Dozens of trains have been organized in the past few days to ferry stranded migrant workers, students and tourists home.  India has recorded a total of 42,533 cases, including 1,373 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

  1:42 a.m. ET, May 4, 2020 "Operation Warp Speed" scientists in US have identified 14 coronavirus vaccines to focus on Scientists working as part of the White House’s “Operation Warp Speed” to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus have identified 14 vaccines to focus on for development, an administration official told CNN’s Jim Acosta. CNN’s Sara Murray reports "Operation Warp Speed" was a name chosen by the scientists working on all the challenges that surround vaccine deployment. They are already working on solutions to quickly ramp up production, organize distribution and determine who gets the first doses of the vaccine.

  US President Donald Trump said Sunday night at a Fox News town hall, "We are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year." Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told NBC on Thursday it’s possible there could be a vaccine by early next year. "You don't wait until you get an answer before you start manufacturing -- you at risk proactively start making it, assuming it's going to work, and if it does, then you can scale up and hopefully get to that timeline," Fauci said.  "So we want to go quickly, but we want to make sure it's safe and it's effective. I think that is doable."

  1:06 a.m. ET, May 4, 2020 A "travel bubble" between New Zealand and Australia could be a model for post-coronavirus future of tourism From CNN's Julia Hollingsworth in Wellington, New Zealand New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks at a briefing on the coronavirus pandemic at Parliament in Wellington, New Zealand on April 27.  
  It may be some time before tourists are traveling the globe again. But what if you could travel through designated, approved parts of it? Politicians from   Australia  and New Zealand are discussing the possibility of opening up borders to each other, creating a travel corridor -- or "travel bubble" -- between the two nations. Both countries  almost completely shut their borders  to foreigners in March, a huge blow to their respective tourism industries. But with  both appearing  to have  successfully brought  their coronavirus outbreaks under control, politicians are now talking about when borders could be opened to each other. "That is a situation we would all like to be in, but of course, our number one focus at the moment is making sure that both our countries are in the position where we're domestically managing Covid-19 to a point where we can with confidence open borders," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern  said  on April 27. "One thing I'm not willing to do is jeopardize the position that New Zealand has got itself into by moving too soon to open our borders -- even to Australia." 
  It's not clear when this "bubble" could become a reality -- currently both countries still have domestic travel restrictions in place, and all international arrivals are subject to a 14-day quarantine. Travel industry experts say August is when the corridor is likely to be rolled out, possibly in time for the ski season in New Zealand and the school holidays in September. Read more:

  China recorded 85 million domestic tourists during the first three days of the five-day May Day holiday, generating 35 billion yuan ($4.95 billion) in revenue, according to the country's Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Last year, 195 million domestic tourists traveled during the entire holiday, generating 117.7 billion yuan ($16.67 billion) in revenue, according to previous data from the ministry. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry has ordered tourist sites in the country to strictly control the flow of visitors, capping numbers at 30% of each site's capacity. Some 70% of scenic spots rated "A class" in China's tiered grading system were open on the first day of the holiday, according to the ministry.

  12:24 a.m. ET, May 4, 2020 When your home is a Japanese internet cafe, but the coronavirus pandemic forces you out From CNN's Emiko Jozuka, Junko Ogura and Will Ripley in Tokyo A resident picks up his shoes at a temporally shelter for internet-cafe dwellers at the Kanagawa Budokan martial arts gymnasium in Yokohama, Japan, on April 22.

  Odd jobs on construction sites used to earn Takahashi enough money to pay for a private booth   each night at one of Tokyo's internet cafes. But Japan's  coronavirus  lockdown not only cost him his work, it has temporarily closed the cafe that was his de facto home. The 35-year-old has been sleeping rough at a Tokyo bus terminal for two weeks. "Many companies have become bankrupt due to the pandemic. There are many people like me without jobs at the moment," said Takahashi, as he waited in line in   Shinjuku   to   receive a free meal from Moyai, a support group for the homeless. 
  Takahashi is one of Tokyo's  4,000  "internet cafe refugees" --  homeless people , mostly men, who before the pandemic usually paid between $17 and $28 to stay overnight in a 20 square foot booth in one of the city's 24-hour internet cafes. Over the past few weeks, Japan has scrambled to contain an uptick in coronavirus cases. As of Monday, Japan had recorded 15,769 cases nationwide and 523 deaths, according to the country's health ministry. To stop the virus spreading, Japan called a nationwide state of emergency, which closed businesses including internet cafes, forcing their inhabitants to seek refuge elsewhere. The Japanese authorities are providing emergency housing to support those living in internet cafes, but the pandemic measures have exposed a problem that goes back decades. Read more:
