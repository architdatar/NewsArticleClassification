  Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday that New York City is in desperate need of surgical gowns.
  De Blasio said the city did not have enough gowns to get through the week. 
  "I am making an appeal to the federal government," de Blasio said at a news conference. "We need more surgical gowns in New York City and we need them now."
  The mayor credited White House trade adviser Peter Navarro who is now coordinating the country's medical supply chain with providing the city 265,000 Tyvek suits and enough waterproof fabric to make 400,000 gowns.
