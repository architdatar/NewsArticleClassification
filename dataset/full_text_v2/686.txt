  India's top health official has claimed that the country could have a Covid-19 vaccine by end of this year. On Sunday, India surpassed 3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus, after reporting 69,239 new infections in 24 hours, according to the ministry. Indian Minister for Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan said that one of the country's Covid-19 vaccine candidates was in its third phase of clinical trial. "We are very confident that a vaccine will be developed by the end of this year," the minister said on Saturday. "I am happy to say that in the eighth month of the battle, India has the best recovery rate of around 75%. A total of 2.2 million patients have recovered and gone home and another 700,000 are going to be cured very soon.” In India, patients with mild and moderate symptoms are considered  no longer active  after 10 days of symptom onset if they meet certain conditions. A test to confirm that they no longer have the virus is not required. Severe cases can only be discharged after one negative coronavirus test.

  Ever since the  coronavirus pandemic  shuttered clubs, bars and concert halls around the world, music fans have been dreaming of the day they can once again visit a busy, sweaty venue to enjoy  a gig with friends. With infection rates rising in many European countries, this dream could be far off. But some music fans in Leipzig, Germany, have been given the chance to rock for a day in the name of science -- with the help of some glowing hand sanitizer and electronic trackers. Researchers in the German city of Leipzig staged a 1,500-person experimental indoor concert on Saturday to better understand how Covid-19 spreads at big, busy events, and how to prevent it. At the gig, which featured a live performance from musician Tim Bendzko, fans were given respiratory face masks, fluorescent hand gel and electronic "contact trackers" -- small transmitters that determine the contact rates and contact distances of the individual experiment participants. Using data from the contact trackers, scientists from The University of Halle will monitor the number "critical contacts" had by each participant during specific times and locations, while the residue left by fluorescent hand gel will identify frequently touched surfaces.  Researchers hope to use the data to find ways to bring big events, including sports,   back safely. Professor Michael Gekle, the dean of the university's medical faculty and a professor of physiology, told CNN the experiment was being conducted to better prepare authorities on how to conduct events in the upcoming autumn and winter seasons. "There is no zero risk if you want to have life. We want to give the politicians a tool in order to decide rationally whether to allow such an event or not. That means they have to have the tool to predict how many additional infected people such an event will produce," he said.

  Democratic presidential nominee  Joe Biden  said, if elected, he would be willing to shut down the country again should there be a second wave of coronavirus in the US and scientists recommend the move to slow its spread. "I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists," the former vice president told  ABC News'  David Muir during a joint interview with his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris set to air in full Sunday night. 
  Biden said he would "be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives, because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus." He called it the "fundamental flaw" of the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of  more than 175,000 Americans .  "In order to keep the country running and moving, and the economy growing, and people employed, you have to fix the virus," Biden told ABC. "You have to deal with the virus."

  11:50 p.m. ET, August 22, 2020 President Trump to hold news conference on Sunday to discuss "major therapeutic breakthrough" President Trump will hold a news conference at 6 p.m. ET Sunday to discuss “a major therapeutic breakthrough” regarding coronoavirus, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced. She said Alex Azar, Secretary for US Health and Human Services, Stephan Hahn, the head of the Food and Drug Administration, would be in attendance. On Saturday, President  Donald Trump  accused the US Food and Drug Administration of deliberately delaying coronavirus vaccine trials without providing any evidence. "The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics," Trump  tweeted , continuing to push his unfounded theory that there is a "deep state" embedded within the government bureaucracy working against his reelection. He accused the agency of delaying a vaccine for the virus until after the fall election, tweeting: "Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!" Trump ended his tweet by tagging the Twitter account of Hahn, who he  nominated  last year to take up the role. Hahn  assured  Americans earlier this month that the agency "will not cut corners" to approve a vaccine. Read more  here .
