  The price of bitcoin plunged Thursday from about $9,000 per coin to $4,000, with roughly $93 billion wiped from the broader, highly volatile cryptocurrency market within a 24-hour period, according to data from  coinmarketcap.com 
  The price of bitcoin recovered slightly within minutes, and as of late morning Friday the digital currency was trading at about $5,700.
  The swift drop occurred around 10 p.m. ET, following a broader market sell-off that saw the stock market enter “bear market” territory, a 20 percent drop from recent highs amid broader pessimism.
