  South Korea will send a total of 750,000 coronavirus testing kits to the U.S., a public health official has confirmed.
  Some 150,000 kits were shipped last week and another order of 600,000 will be sent Wednesday, according to Yoon Tae Ho, an official at South Korea's Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters. In a briefing Tuesday he confirmed the first shipment was sent on April 10. 
  "I expect another 600,000 test kits to be exported tomorrow," Yoon said.
  South Korea has so far tested more than half a million people, confirming 10,564 cases and 222 deaths.
