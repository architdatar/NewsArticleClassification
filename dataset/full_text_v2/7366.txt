  “YOU DON’T BURN CHURCHES IN AMERICA!” President Trump  tweeted  on Thursday, an apparent reference to a fire that broke out at St. John’s Church, located across the street from the White House, during the protests. (The church’s rector  described it as a small fire.) 
  Last year, the president was silent when three historically black churches in one Louisiana parish burned in a 10-day span. Pence commented  after the Washington Post pointed this out , and he later  visited .
  A  sheriff deputy’s son was later charged ; he pleaded guilty  earlier this year , admitting he set the fires to raise his profile as a metal musician.
  Black churches have frequently been targeted throughout American history, and many were burned down during the Jim Crow era.
