  Bon Jovi keyboardist David Bryan said Saturday that he's tested positive for coronavirus.
  "I just got my results back today and tested positive for corona virus," the rock musician, 58, said on Instagram. "Iâ€™ve been sick for a week and feeling better each day."
  Bryan, who said in 2017 playing live is  "the greatest feeling in the world,"  told fans that he's been "quarantined for a week" and will stay away from others for at least another week.
  "I'll get tested again to make sure I'm free of this nasty virus," the New Jersey resident said.
