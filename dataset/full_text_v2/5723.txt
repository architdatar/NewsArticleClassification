  Santa Anita Park, one of the nation's most iconic race tracks,  announced Friday  that it's suspending live racing because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
  The picturesque horse racing track in Arcadia, California, just northeast of  Los Angeles, typically runs  thoroughbreds  three days a week and had the  $100,000 Santa Ana Stakes  on tap for Saturday. 
  Horse racing is one of the last sports operating, albeit with no fans in the stands, as America deals with the pandemic. 
  An overwhelming majority of  tracks have closed , though the  Florida Derby,  a stepping stone to the rescheduled  Kentucky Derby , is still set to run on  Saturday at Gulfstream Park .
