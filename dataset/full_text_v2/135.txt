  The 'Light It Blue' campaign hits the U.S. starting at 8 p.m. local time on Thursday — calling on businesses and communities across the country to shine blue lights or share messages of thanks to essential workers on the frontlines in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. 
  Broadway theaters  are set to participate in the campaign, as well as New York City landmarks  Bryant Park  and  One World Observatory . Other participants across the U.S. include  LAX Airport  and the  St. Louis skyline .
  The # LightItBlue  initiative originally started in the UK, with blue symbolizing health care workers, and is largely a volunteer effort. 
  Let’s shine a light on our frontline and essential workers and salute their continued hard work and dedication. Tonight at 8 PM local, landmarks across the US will  #LightItBlue  to show their support.  pic.twitter.com/PlfpP9yz0B
