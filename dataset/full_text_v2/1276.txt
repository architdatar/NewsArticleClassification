  About 200 cars were still in line when the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment decided to close a drive-up testing site in Denver "due to high-volume," officials said in a statement.
  The site will remain closed Saturday afternoon, but it's expected to reopen next week.
  Since "Colorado now has capacity for private labs to conduct testing," officials are encouraging thoseÂ who show symptoms or believe they might have been exposed to COVID-19 "to call or email their physician first for guidance."
