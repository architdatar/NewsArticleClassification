  An employee at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has tested positive for COVID-19, the agency announced in a Sunday press release.
  The employee is not involved in patient care and works for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.
  The NIH, the nation's medical research agency, said its Occupational Medical Service tested the employee and the result was positive.
  "While this is an unfortunate development, it is not surprising, and NIH expects that there will be more cases of infection among NIH staff," the agency said in a press release.
