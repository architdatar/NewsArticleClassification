  American Airlines said it will start a phased suspension of nearly all long-haul international flights starting Monday, due to reduced demand and  travel restrictions  from the outbreak.
  Between March 16 and May 6, the company will reduce its international capacity by 75 percent on a "year over year basis," it said  in a statement  Saturday.
  The airline also anticipates its domestic capacity in April will be reduced by 20 percent compared to last year. It also projected it will be reduced by 30 percent in May.
