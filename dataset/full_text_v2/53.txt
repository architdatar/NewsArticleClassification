  These are "make-or-break" days in America's fight against the new coronavirus, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Friday.
  The mayor of the country's second-largest city spoke to MSNBC on Friday, a day after announcing stringent protective measures such as banning all events or conferences for more than 50 people on city-owned properties.
  Garcetti said he is impressed by state and local officials across the country taking similar steps to try to slow the spread of the virus.
  They "know that these are the most critical days we have. We will look back on this period and this will be the make-or-break days," the mayor said.
  The novel  coronavirus  has killed 41 people in the United States and  surpassed 1,700 confirmed or presumptive cases  as of Friday morning. Los Angeles County has 32 confirmed cases and 1 death so far from coronavirus. A total of four people have died from the virus in California.
