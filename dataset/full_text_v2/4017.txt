  New Zealand is lifting almost all restrictions now that it no longer has any active cases of Covid-19 -- but its international borders will remain shut to non-residents to prevent new outbreaks.  That is, unless they receive special permission. Some overseas visitors and businesspeople will be allowed to enter the country and work there if they can demonstrate that they will provide a benefit to the New Zealand economy. Acclaimed film director James Cameron is one of those. He and his crew have been given permission by the New Zealand government to work inside the country on "Avatar 2," CNN learned today. The first "Avatar" movie is the highest-grossing film in history, bringing in roughly $2.8 billion at the worldwide box office in 2009. The release date for "Avatar 2" has been bumped from December 18, 2020 to December, 17, 2021.

  9:16 a.m. ET, June 8, 2020 With no active Covid-19 cases, New Zealand is lifting almost all its coronavirus restrictions From CNN's Ben Westcott Almost all coronavirus restrictions in New Zealand will be lifted tomorrow, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced, after the country reported no active cases. Schools and workplaces will be able to reopen  under the new "level 1" rules,  with no limitations on gatherings or domestic travel. However, social distancing is still encouraged, and Ardern said New Zealand's international borders will remain shut to non-residents to prevent new outbreaks. Residents arriving in New Zealand will still have to quarantine for two weeks. New Zealand currently has no active coronavirus cases, and no positive cases reported in the past 17 days.  There has been no one receiving treatment in hospital for Covid-19 for the past 12 days and it has been 40 days since the last case of community transmission. "This freedom from restrictions relies though heavily on the ongoing role that our border controls will play in keeping the virus out ... The virus will be in our world for some time to come," Ardern said at a press conference Monday.

The country diagnosed 4,728 cases in just the past 24 hours, said the ministry.  Pakistan lifted its nationwide lockdown in early May, though the rate of new infections continues to rise -- which could be in part due to an increase in testing by the government.  The country has conducted 705,833 tests as of Monday, with 22,650 tests conducted in the past 24 hours, said the ministry.

  9:20 a.m. ET, June 8, 2020 New infections are still the biggest risk to the economy From CNN's Anneken Tappe The US economy is reopening and the labor market is bouncing back after dramatic losses during the height of the Covid-19 lockdown. But a major risk lies ahead. The lion's share of economists participating in the June National Associate of Business Economics Outlook Survey -- 87% -- believe a second wave of infections could imperil a rebound and become the biggest danger to America's economy this year. The pandemic has claimed  more than 100,000 lives  in the United States and forced the country to go into lockdown in March. Businesses shuttered and laid off millions of people, leading to the  steepest job losses on record  — 20.7 million — in April. The  labor market bounced back strongly in May , adding 2.5 million new jobs as states begin to reopen. But the staggered restart of the economy could lead to renewed spreading of the highly contagious virus. This could, in turn, lead to a second lockdown that would bring yet more economic pain.

  The fate of next year's  Olympic Games  depends on Japan's handling of the coronavirus, according to the Tokyo governor. Gov. Yuriko Koike said the Games could signify a "victory" over the pandemic, but admitted that more work is still needed to improve treatment and testing, and that organizers were contending with a number of uncertainties. The Olympics were originally scheduled to begin in July, but  the start date has been moved  to July 24 next year amid the Covid-19 outbreak. "The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are an important event that everyone has been waiting for," Koike told CNN's Will Ripley. "The postponement cost a lot and, more than anything, we do not know what the coronavirus situation will be like in July next year. We have a few uncertainties here ... It costs a lot to begin with, we need understanding from the people of Tokyo for it. We must not spend too much. We have to make the Games safe for athletes and spectators." 
  Organizers said in December that the cost of hosting the Olympics was some  1.35 trillion yen ($12.35 billion),  while sponsors, insurers and broadcasters have also committed billions to the Games. Read the  full interview here .
