  Gaven Daniel, 17, wasn’t feeling well when he woke up March 18. He was scheduled to check into Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center to begin treatments for an aggressive type of bone cancer, but when his mother called the care team that morning to let them know he had a fever and a cough, they told her not to make the one-hour drive from Dayton, Ohio.
  Instead, they instructed her to get Gaven tested locally to ensure he wasn’t suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
  The doctors wouldn't be able to begin chemotherapy if he was infected, and they didn’t want to needlessly risk exposing hospital staff members.
  Although initial reports suggest that most children and teens are not at high risk of dying from COVID-19, the pandemic is threatening their health in other ways. Children’s hospitals are facing the same supply shortages and testing backlogs that have been hampering adult hospitals nationally.
