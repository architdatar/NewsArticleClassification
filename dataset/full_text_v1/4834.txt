  Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday that New York has seen the lowest number of daily coronavirus deaths since the state became the epicenter of the virus. 
  The state had 84 deaths Friday, which  Cuomo said  "is a hideous number" by any normal standard but marks the first time since March the figure was below 100.
  With new hospitalizations also declining, the governor said the state expects to reopen the mid-Hudson region and Long Island.
  Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Sullivan and Ulster counties are set to reopen on Tuesday as long as teams of contact tracers in the area complete online training. Cuomo said the region needs 1,991 contact tracers. So far, 1,134 have been trained.
  The governor said officials are considering reopening Long Island by Wednesday.
  New York City beaches will remain closed during Memorial Day weekend while state beaches are expected to remain open for residents only.
