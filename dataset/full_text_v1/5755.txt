  Scotland's government is recommending that people wear face coverings in situations where maintaining social distancing is difficult, such as on public transportation or inside food shops, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday. 
  Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Sturgeon acknowledged that evidence on the benefits of face coverings was not "overwhelming," but said there may be "some benefit" to wearing them in enclosed spaces. 
  The Scottish government said this in a statement:
  Sturgeon added that wearing a face covering does not mean that other social distancing rules don't apply, and cautioned against people feeling "invincible" because they are wearing a mask.
