  Trump slams Biden in epic Rose Garden remarks, the former VP's campaign has now responded 

  President Trump  veered off-script Tuesday after  announcing new legislation  against China to attack  Joe Biden  over his recent policy proposals – accusing the former vice president of aligning his campaign with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive leaders.
  “Biden has gone radical left,” Trump said. “There's never been a time when two candidates were so different.”
  The Biden campaign later fired back at Trump's comments, saying: "Today’s statement that was ostensibly supposed to be about China, but there was one topic that President Trump couldn’t seem to get off his mind: Joe Biden, whose name the President invoked nearly 30 times. The whole sad affair says more about Donald Trump than he said about any particular topic.
  "The American taxpayer should be reimbursed for the abuse of funds this spectacle represented," the campaign said, adding that "a real leader" -- referring to Biden -- spoke earlier in Wilmington.
  Trump’s comments come hours after  Biden released a $2 trillion plan  on Tuesday to boost investment in clean energy and stop all climate-damaging emissions from U.S. power plants by 2035. 
“When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is ‘hoax,'" Biden told reporters. "When I think about climate change, what I think of is jobs.”  Click here for more on our top story.

  St. Louis homeowner who faced down protesters with rifle believes Trump intervened to protect his community 
  Missouri  attorney  Mark McCloskey,  who along with his wife Patricia brandished legally-owned firearms when confronted by Black Lives Matter protesters at their St. Louis home last month, told " Hannity " Monday that he  believes President Trump quietly intervened  when protesters returned to his neighborhood for a second time July 3. 
"The second night that people came and the cops were there ... I had a source on the ground and I've not been able to confirm it, maybe you can," host Sean Hannity told McCloskey. "Is it true President Trump sent in people to defend your neighborhood and nobody knew about it?"
  
"That's the information we have," McCloskey responded. "I think we got help from the very top. That night, we had cooperation, I think, from the federal government, from the state government, the local police department. That night everybody stood up like champs but it came from the top down." 
"I can't express my appreciation enough for everybody involved," he added. 
McCloskey joined "Hannity" after he told  told "Tucker Carlson Tonight"  that "the rumor is that" he and his wife "are going to be  indicted shortly"  over the June 28 incident that received national attention.
  McCloskey maintained Tuesday that he and his wife "did nothing wrong" in protecting their home and vowed that they will not "be intimidated" by authorities subjecting them to an investigation.  Click for more
