  The Treasury Department and the IRS are urging taxpayers who want to get their economic impact payments directly deposited to their bank accounts to enter their information online by Wednesday.
  The government has sent out about 130 million payments in the first four weeks of the program by both direct deposit and by mail.
  The IRS said Monday that people should use the “ Get My Payment  ” tool on the IRS website by noon on Wednesday to provide their direct deposit information.
  After that time, the agency will begin preparing millions of files to send to Bureau of Financial Services for paper checks that will begin arriving through late May and into June. The government cannot provide direct deposit once the process of sending a paper check has commenced.
