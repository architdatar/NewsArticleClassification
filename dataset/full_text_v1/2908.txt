  Etsy, an online marketplace famous for its homemade goods, is asking its sellers to make masks.
  "This is a moment for the Etsy seller community to come together, meet this unprecedented need, and help those around them," the company said  in an email  to its sellers. "If you have the skill and materials, you can help — start making masks today."
  The company also noted that "skyrocketing demand" was on track to exhaust its current inventory of masks.
  Some areas of the U.S. have asked that people who go out in public wear masks, and the White House is  expected to make a recommendation  that people in areas of high transmission wear masks.
