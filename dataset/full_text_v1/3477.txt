  Gov. Andrew Cuomo was given a coronavirus test live during his daily press briefing on Sunday to demonstrate the ease with which the test is given. 
  Cuomo was encouraging New Yorkers who think they might have COVID-19 — the disease caused by the novel coronavirus — to go online, find a nearby testing location and schedule an appointment.
  "It is a fast and easy thing to do," Cuomo said. 
  He added that tests are now available but that not enough people in the state of New York were being tested. Cuomo said that when he asks people why they had yet to be tested, they were reluctant for a drove of reasons. 
  "There is a general proclivity where, and I don't mean any disrespect to the medical professionals — my sister is a doctor — but some people just don't like to go to the doctor and don't like to get tested," Cuomo said.
  "I am not good at this, but this test is not an invasive test, there's no pain to this test there is nothing about this test that should intimidate people from not taking this test. ... It is so fast and so easy that even a governor can take this test. That's how fast and easy it is," Cuomo said.
  He wanted to show anyone doubting him, he said, how fast and easy it is to take a coronavirus test. 
  Cuomo then stood to introduce Dr. Elizabeth Dufort, a pediatric infectious disease specialist from Albany, New York, who administered the test to him as he stood up from his seat. 
  Dufort told Cuomo to lift his head and close his eyes, which he questioned, telling viewers, "You can question the doctor."
  Dufort responded that it was for comfort and because Cuomo might tear up. 
  Then, Dufort inserted a swap into one of Cuomo's nostril for approximately five seconds. 
  "That's it? That's it. Nothing else? Told you," Cuomo said, almost shrugging his shoulders as he thanked the doctor.
