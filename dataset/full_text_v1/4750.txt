  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a  $3 trillion coronavirus aid  package on Tuesday that includes emergency funding to help with the cost of broadband internet.
  Some  $4 billion  is expected to go to companies providing internet access, with a further $1.5 billion to help libraries keep people connected.  
  The so-called HEROES Act, which creates an “Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund,” is expected to go to vote on Friday. 
  The act includes up to $50 per month as a subsidy for broadband access, but according to the language of the bill, the money will be used to reimburse providers. Some families have been  losing access  to the internet because they haven’t been able to pay their bills. 
  Gigi Sohn, an advocate for affordable and reliable communications infrastructure and a former counselor to the Federal Communications Commission, welcomed the move.
  “Broadband internet access is vital to learning, working, shopping, obtaining healthcare, connecting with friends and family and importantly to social distancing,” she said in a statement. “Every American must have access to robust broadband internet during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
