  The judge who sentenced the  rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine  to prison said Wednesday he would have ordered home confinement instead if he had known about the coronavirus in December.
  U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer  commented in a written order even as he rejected a lawyer's request that the 23-year-old performer, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, be confined at home for the remaining four months of his two-year prison term.  He cited Tekashi 6ix9ine's heightened vulnerability to the virus because he has asthma.
  He said he didn't have legal authority to  change the sentence,  which prosecutors pointed out when they opposed the request.
  Tekashi 6ix9ine's testimony against members of the  Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods  gang earned him leniency from charges that could have subjected him to a mandatory minimum 37 years in prison for crimes that included orchestrating a shooting in which an innocent bystander was wounded.
