  Around the country, thousands of protesters are  shoulder-to-shoulder , shouting for change. Some wear masks.  Few wear eye coverings. And  social distancing  is near impossible.
  “The question that's been posed to me is do mass protests have the risk of spreading covid-19?  The answer is: yes,” Dr. Jay Varkey, an infectious disease physician at Emory said.
  Director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Robert Redfield also advised demonstrators to “highly consider” a coronavirus test. That doesn’t mean go to a testing site a day after protesting. 
  “The virus enters your body immediately.  But it does take some time for enough of the virus to build up in your system for a diagnostic test to detect it,” NBC medical correspondent Dr. John Torres said.
  “In three, five, seven days, go get tested,” Redfield said.
  Getting a test too early could result in a false negative.  So waiting between 3-7 days will give a more accurate read.
