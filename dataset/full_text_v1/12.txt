  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said Thursday that he was not pleased with the state of the pandemic in the US.
  “Bottom line is, I'm not pleased with how things are going," he said during a National Geographic panel.
  Fauci said states such as California, Florida, Texas and Arizona have turned their situations around and they are “having now, less deaths, less hospitalizations, less cases.”
  But he warned it’s not all good news across the country.
  “We know now, from sad past experience, that that's a predictor that you're going to have more surges,” he said.
