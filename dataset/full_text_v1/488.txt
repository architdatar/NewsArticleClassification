  A recent study from New York University's Langone Health found that a rapid coronavirus test missed more than 48 percent of positive cases. 
  The study, which has not been peer reviewed, concluded that the Abbot ID NOW COVID-19 tests missed a third of the samples detected positive when using nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium and more than 48 percent when using dry nasal swabs.
  Abbott Labs said in a statement Wednesday its test was studied "in a manner that it’s not intended to be used."
  "It’s unclear how the samples were tested," the statement said. "The outcomes in this paper are inconsistent with any experience that we’ve had with this instrument." Abbott added that out of 1.8 million tests distributed, the false negative rate was about .02 percent
  NYU said in a statement Wednesday that the study's authors acknowledge their limitations, including a small sample size and testing of the nasal swabs in the laboratory rather that at the point of care.
  The Food and Drug Administration said it was aware of the NYU report and are reviewing the information from the study.
