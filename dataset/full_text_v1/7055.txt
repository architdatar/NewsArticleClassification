The last time the Fed cut rates so low was during the global financial crisis just more than a decade ago. "That's really great for our country," Trump proclaimed. "It's something that we're very happy, I have to say this, I'm very happy. And they did it in one step, they didn't do it in four steps over a long period of time.

It also struck a deal with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to lower their rates on currency swaps to keep the financial markets functioning normally.
