  Britain has not yet reached its peak of coronavirus infections, which would allow for an easing of tight restrictions of movement, health minister Matt Hancock said on Saturday.
  His announcement comes as the death toll in British hospitals has reached nearly 9,000, with 980 of those fatalities  reported on Friday , a figure which surpassed even the deadliest day so far in Italy.
  “Our judgment is we’re not there yet. We haven’t seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we’ve reached the peak,” Hancock told BBC radio on Saturday. Nobody knows when that might be, he said. 
  The U.K. government came under fire for an alleged lack of preparedness on Saturday. The British Medical Association said current supplies in were insufficient, and doctors faced a “heart-breaking” decision over whether to treat patients without proper personal protection equipment (PPE) and therefore put themselves at risk, according to Reuters. Nineteen health care professionals have died in the country as of Saturday
  Among those who have been infected is Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is  recovering in a hospital  after spending three nights in intensive care. He is making “very good progress” in his recovery, his office said on Saturday.
