  Airbnb will lay off 25 percent of its workforce, or 1,900 employees, the home-sharing company confirmed on Tuesday.
  “We are collectively living through the most harrowing crisis of our lifetime," CEO Brian Chesky told employees on a group call. 
  Chesky said revenue for 2020 is expected to be less than half of what it was in 2019, with no clear idea when travel will return, nor what it will look like.
  "Travel in this new world will look different, and we need to evolve Airbnb accordingly," Chesky said.
  The travel industry as a whole has been pummeled by the viral outbreak, with airlines, hotels and resorts, and cruise lines ground to a halt.
  Airbnb had been hoping to start the process this spring to go public,  either by direct listing or via IPO.
