  Organizers of the Game Developers Conference scheduled for next month in San Francisco have postponed the event amid a coronavirus outbreak that has spread from China to countries around the world.
  Organizers  in an announcement Friday  did not explicitly mention the coronavirus or the illness caused by it, COVID-19.
  But the announcement comes after Amazon Web Services  pulled out of the conference Â because of concerns over COVID-19. The company called it a difficult decision. Microsoft, which makes the popular Xbox system,  also announced  it would withdraw.
  "We fully intend to host a GDC event later in the summer," Organizers of the Game Developers Conference said.
