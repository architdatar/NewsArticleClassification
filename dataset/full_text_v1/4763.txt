  Professional sports teams in New Jersey are allowed to practice and play in games or matches, Gov. Phil Murphy announced Tuesday.
  Teams will only be allowed to use athletic facilities where team personnel are on location, according to an executive order that Murphy signed last Friday.
  “While leagues make their own decisions about operations, I am confident that teams are equipped to practice and eventually play in a responsible manner, protecting the health and safety of players, coaches, and team personnel,” Murphy said.
