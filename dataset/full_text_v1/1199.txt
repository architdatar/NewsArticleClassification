China reported its first day with no coronavirus deaths since the outbreak began on Monday, officials from the National Health Commission said.Â 
  On April 6, there were no new confirmed cases, no new suspected cases, and no new deaths in China, officials said at a news conference.
  While domestic cases are under control, China is still grappling with managing imported cases, mostly Chinese nationals returning from abroad. Prevention and control measures to prevent further outbreaks were still "arduous," said Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission.
