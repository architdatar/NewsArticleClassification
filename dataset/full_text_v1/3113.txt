  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US' top infectious disease expert, addressed a series of tweets by President Donald Trump which were taken down overnight on Monday -- one of which touted hydroxychloroquine as a cure for coronavirus.
  Fauci said there were other measures everyone should take to protect themselves, including wearing masks.
  “We should all be wearing masks outside,” he said. “There are fundamental things we should be doing, particularly if you happen to be in an area where there’s viral activity.”
  Fauci said that in addition to wearing masks, people should continue social distancing, avoid crowds and practice good hand hygiene.
  The expert also said that officials should close bars in areas where there was evidence of viral activity.
