  Three more people were diagnosed with novel coronavirus in Northern California, raising the number of confirmed cases in Santa Clara County to seven, public health officials said Sunday.
  It wasn't immediately clear how one of the patients contracted the virus. The county Health Department described the person as a woman with a chronic health condition.
  A couple with chronic health conditions who had recently traveled to Egypt also tested positive for the virus and are now hospitalized.
  The county's Health Department  announced a case of possible “community spread”  on Friday — the patient hadn't traveled to China nor knowingly been in contact with others who have the virus.
  Santa Clara County is about 50 miles southeast of San Francisco.
