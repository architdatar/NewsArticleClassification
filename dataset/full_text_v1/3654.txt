  The Washington state high school student with coronavirus didn’t know he was being tested for the illness, Snohomish Health District  said in a press release  Saturday.
  The student started feeling sick on Monday, and eventually went to a clinic and got a flu test, which came back negative. 
  Unbeknownst to him and his family, a sample from the clinic was passed along to Seattle Children’s, which, as part of an ongoing study, tested it for a number of pathogens, including the coronavirus.
  The student stayed home from school until he had been fever-free for 48 hours. He had returned to campus “for approximately 5 minutes” on Friday when he received a call to come home immediately. His family “did all the right things,” the press release said.
