  Grammy Award-winning singer Billie Eilish is urging her younger fans to stay inside amid the coronavirus outbreak, saying the situation is “not a joke” and needs to be taken seriously.
  In an  Instagram story  posted Monday afternoon, Eilish — who had to postpone several of her world tour dates because of the outbreak — said she feels that some younger people who haven’t seen the effect of the coronavirus with their own eyes are less likely to heed warnings to stay home and socially isolate.
  “I’ve seen a lot of young people out in the world, like, all over the place going to the club or going to the beach or like just going out or hanging out and it’s really irresponsible,” Eilish, 18, said.
  She added that at first, when she learned of COVID-19, she didn’t care about the virus, thinking she was young and “immune” but said she now understands the severity.   
  “I did not realize it’s not about me … it’s not about you. It’s about if you do happen to get it or you're near somebody who gets it and you don’t even get it, you can transfer it to someone who is much more weak,” Eilish said. “Don’t panic, but don’t be an idiot.”
