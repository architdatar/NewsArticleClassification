  Game shows "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune"  will not tape  in front of studio audiences amid the spread of coronavirus, a source close to the shows told NBC News.
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website that "social distancing" is one way to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus and the illness it causes, COVID-19, in communities.
  Santa Clara County, California,  banned mass gatherings  of more than 1,000 people in an effort to prevent transmission, officials said Monday.
