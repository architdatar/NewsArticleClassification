  Vermont Gov. Phil Scott issued a stay-at-home order for the state that included the closure of all non-essential businesses to try and halt the spread of coronavirus. 
  The order restricts residents to only leaving their homes for essential reasons, critical to health and safety, according to a press release Tuesday. Those who do leave their home will be forced to adhere to social distancing policies of staying at least six feet apart. 
  “I fully recognize the emotional, financial and economic impact of these decisions, but based on the best science we have available, these measures are necessary," Scott said.
  I've just signed a stay-at-home order and directed the closure of in-person operations for all non-essential businesses.  Vermonters: you must stay home. You must stay home to save lives.  We are all in this together - and we'll get through it, together.  https://t.co/foLDJYZIq7
