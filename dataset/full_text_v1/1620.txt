  Amid anti-lockdown protests by a far-right party, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the country will reopen to international tourists in July.
  "We will guarantee tourists will not take any risks and will not bring us any risks," the prime minister said at a news conference Saturday.
  Foreign visitors contribute around an eighth of Spain’s economic output and government curbs taken to contain one of Europe's severest coronavirus outbreaks have shuttered everything from hotels, bars and restaurants to beaches and leisure parks just as the tourism season gets under way. 
  Several thousand followers of Spain’s far-right Vox party gathered on Saturday in Madrid and other cities to protest the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. 
  Vox called for protesters to come in their cars and motorbikes to skirt the current prohibition on social gatherings in effect under the nation’s two-month long state of emergency.

  “Let your desire be heard for the resignation of the government,” Vox leader Santiago Abascal said from an open-top bus leading the cars inching down a Madrid boulevard. Vox called the protest the “Caravan for Spain and Liberty.”
  Most cars were decked with Spanish flags, and there were also small groups of people who participated on foot, with some not respecting the two-meter social distancing rules. Over 28,000 Spaniards have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19. The lockdown successfully reduced the daily contagion rate of over 20 percent at the height of the crisis to under 1 percent for the past week.
