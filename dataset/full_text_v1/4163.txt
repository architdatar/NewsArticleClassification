  Los Angeles Rams center Brian Allen tested positive for the coronavirus illness COVID-19 three weeks ago, the team confirmed Wednesday night.
  He appears to be the first NFL player confirmed to have tested positive for the illness.
  Allen, 24, who was selected in the 2018 NFL draft, earlier in the day  told Fox Sports' Jay Glazer  that he woke up and couldn't smell anything, lost his sense of taste and had flu-like symptoms.
  "He is 'feeling good, he's healthy and he's on the road to recovery,'" the Rams tweeted Wednesday night. That statement is from Rams head coach Sean McVay's comments to Glazer, according to a post on  the team's website . McVay said that after the positive test the team shut down its facility immediately.
  New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton  announced in March  that he tested positive for the coronavirus, and at the time he was said to be the first major figure within the league to test positive for the virus.
  Rams confirm Brian Allen tested positive for COVID-19 three weeks ago.  He is "feeling good, he's healthy and he's on the road to recovery."
