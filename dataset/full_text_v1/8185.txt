  Walmart sold enough toilet paper in five days for every American to have their own roll, a statistic cited by the retail giant's CEO in saying that shoppers should buy only what they need for a week instead of stocking up. 
  As to what else people are buying, CEO Doug McMillon said on TODAY on Friday that initially food was flying off the shelves during the pandemic. Then entertainment and educational products such as puzzles and games became popular. Now, grooming products like hair color and beard trimmers are in high demand. 
  Walmart's business has increased during the crisis, leading to the hiring of more than 100,000 new workers since March 19.
  All employees have masks and gloves and starting Friday, their temperatures were being taken before they began their shifts.
