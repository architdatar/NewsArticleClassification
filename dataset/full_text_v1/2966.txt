  Facebook's head of ads and business products said Friday that the social media giant is banning ads and commerce listings for medical masks.
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  does not recommend  masks or respirators for the general public.
  Update: We’re banning ads and commerce listings selling medical face masks. We’re monitoring COVID19 closely and will make necessary updates to our policies if we see people trying to exploit this public health emergency. We’ll start rolling out this change in the days ahead.
