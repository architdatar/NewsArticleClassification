  Spanish tourism minister Reyes Maroto  announced Thursday  that the country's land borders with neighbors France and Portugal will be reopened June 22.
  The authorities closed the borders to everybody but Spaniards, cross-border workers and truck drivers from mid-March when the country went into lockdown to curb the coronavirus contagion.
  Reopening borders is a key issue in Europe's usually border-free Schengen area. Countries are keen to kickstart their economies and facilitate travel for tourism and other purposes.Â
