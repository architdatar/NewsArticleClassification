  Government employees went back to work in Iran on Saturday as President Hassan Rouhani said mosques are to resume daily prayers throughout the country, even though some areas are seeing high levels of virus infections.
  Rouhani also said on state television that the hours of shopping malls — which had been allowed to open only until 6 p.m. — will be extended, a further step in the government’s plans to ease virus restrictions.
  “Doors to mosques across the country will open to public for daily prayers,” Rouhani said, adding that social distancing and other health protocols should be observed. However, he did not say exactly when they are due to reopen.
   Iran has so far reported 146,668 virus infections, and 7,677 deaths.
