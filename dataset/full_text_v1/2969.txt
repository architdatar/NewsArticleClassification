  Facebook is canceling all of its scheduled physical events with 50 or more people through June 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post Thursday.
  "Some of these we will hold as virtual events instead and we'll share more details on that soon,"  Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook . "Similarly, we're extending our policy of no business travel through at least June of this year as well."
  Zuckerberg also said the "vast majority" of the company's employees would continue to work from home "through at least the end of May."
  "A small percent of our critical employees who can't work remotely, like content reviewers working on counter-terrorism or suicide and self-harm prevention, and engineers working on complex hardware, may be able to return sooner, but overall, we don't expect to have everyone back in our offices for some time," he said.
