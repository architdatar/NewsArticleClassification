  Broadway actor Nick Cordero will have his right leg amputated as a result of coronavirus-related complications, his wife  Amanda Kloots said on her Instagram  Saturday.
  The  41-year-old actor  known for his roles in "Waitress" and "Rock of Ages" has spent 18 days in intensive care battling the virus. According to Kloots, doctors initially put her husband on blood thinners in an attempt to ease some clotting in Cordero’s leg. But the treatment was causing him to have internal bleeding and blood pressure issues.
  “We took him off the blood thinners, but that again was going to cause the clotting in the right leg,” Kloots said. “So the right leg will be amputated today.”
  Cordero started to receive intensive care after " having a hard time breathing .” He was initially diagnosed with pneumonia and tested negative for COVID-19 twice before a third test showed he was positive.
