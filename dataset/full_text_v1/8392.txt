  White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany reiterated that President Trump  supports opening schools fully , without any kind of remote learning in the fall, and she argued “science should not stand in the way” of that goal.
  “The science is on our side here,” she added. 
  McEnany cited a Journal of the American Medical Association pediatric study of 46 hospitals that she said showed the risk to children posed by Covid-19 is less than that posed by the seasonal flu. 
  “We encourage for localities and states to just simply follow the science, open our schools. It’s very damaging to our children,” she said. “There’s a lack of reporting of abuse, there’s mental depressions that are not addressed, suicidal ideations that are not address when students are not in school.”
  Remember:  Many experts  worry about returning to classrooms  not necessarily because of the risk to the students themselves, but because of the risk that children could worsen the spread of coronavirus by bringing it home to older relatives and because teachers and school employees would also be put at risk for serious illness.  
  Despite Trump’s aggressive push for school reopenings, a number of the nation’s largest school districts have announced  they will not return  for in-person learning at the start of the school year in the fall.
