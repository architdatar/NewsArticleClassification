  The University of Connecticut said Saturday it was canceling all official travel to Italy and urged students already in the country for the university's study-abroad program to return to the United States as soon as possible. 
  More than 300 students at UConn participate in overseas academic programs in 29 nations, including 88 in Italy.
  The school said its decision to have students return to the U.S. is due to circumstances surrounding coronavirus and comes after the CDC issued new guidance Friday evening. 
  "To date, no cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the State of Connecticut or at UConn," the university said in a press release. 
  The university had already decided to cancel all official travel to China and South Korea.
