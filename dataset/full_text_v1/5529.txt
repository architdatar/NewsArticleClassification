  The 75-year-old protester injured when he fell and hit his head after he was  pushed by two police officers  in Buffalo, New York was out of intensive care Tuesday,  his lawyer said .
  Martin Gugino was hospitalized in serious but stable condition following the fall Thursday as a line of officers cleared a street during a  George Floyd  demonstration. Two officers were  suspended without pay  and charged with allegations of second-degree assault.
  On Tuesday, President Donald Trump  tweeted a conspiracy theory  that Gugino, a peace activist and  Catholic Worker Movement volunteer , is a "provocateur" from the anti-fascist, or antifa, movement.
  Gugino's lawyer, Byron W. Brown, responded on  Twitter : "The City of Buffalo is laser focused on healing, taking action against racial injustice and building a good future for our residents."
