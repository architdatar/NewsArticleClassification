  Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced a stay-at-home order Thursday after traffic patterns showed residents were beginning to travel more despite advice from public health officials. 
  Lee said that while "good faith efforts" were made to follow social distancing guidelines, an uptick in traffic beginning Monday indicated many were beginning to disregard the coronavirus precautions . 
  “The month of April stands to be an extremely tough time for our state as we face the potential for a surge in COVID-19 cases,” said Lee. “Every Tennessean must take this seriously, remain at home and ensure we save lives.”
  The measure follows that of several other states in requiring residents to stay in their homes unless they must engage in an essential activity, such as grocery shopping or utilizing healthcare services.
  For that reason, I went a step further with my safer at home order & have said that Tennesseans must remain at home unless they are engaging in essential activity. Staying home isn't an option - it's a requirement for the swift defeat of COVID-19. https://t.co/SC7M7O1DBu   pic.twitter.com/GDY2IzcQaL
