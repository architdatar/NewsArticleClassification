  On a livestream today, Joe Biden suggested that  coronavirus checks  were being held up by the president.
  “No American should have to wait a single minute so Donald Trump can put his signature on a physical check,” the front-runner for the Democratic nomination said on Thursday. “It isn’t about him, it’s about families that need the cash now.”
  Biden is possibly referring to a recent  Wall Street Journal report  from late last week. The paper reported that according to an administration official, the president had told people he wanted his signature to  appear on the direct payment checks . Though that would be unusual, there's no evidence that’s actually holding up payments.
  Trump administration officials have said the money will go out via direct deposit and physical check within weeks, but logistical and technological issues are  expected to delay many of the payments . "if we have your information, you’ll get it within two weeks," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Thursday during the White House briefing.
