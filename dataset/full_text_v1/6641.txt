  Deaths from the virus remain high in the US.
  Coronavirus has infected  more than 5 million people and killed over 166,000  in the country, according to Johns Hopkins University. On Wednesday alone, there were  55,910 reported new cases and 1,499 deaths  — the highest number of fatalities since May.
  Meanwhile, the seven-day average of daily coronavirus deaths was over 1,000 on Wednesday, the 17th consecutive day the US averaged over 1,000 deaths per day.
  Adjusting for population, states in the Southeast are seeing the most new cases.  Georgia  and  Florida  — states led by Republican governors who have not issued face mask requirements — have the highest per capita new cases over the past seven days, followed by Alabama and Mississippi.
  On Wednesday, Florida health officials announced more than 8,000 new case reports and 212 new deaths.
