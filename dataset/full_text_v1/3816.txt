  Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a plan to provide relief for student loan borrowers in Illinois who were left out of the  federal relief plan through the CARES Act . 
  The coronavirus relief bill halted federal student loan payments until the end of September, with no interest, but failed to account for students with private loans not controlled by the Department of Education. Pritzker said Tuesday that his plan with 20 private lenders would bring relief to nearly 140,000 more student loan borrowers in the state. 
  "We created a multi-state agreement that includes borrowers in Illinois, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont, Virginia and Washington State," Pritzker said. "Impacted borrowers can immediately contact their loan provider to get relief with these new options." 
  While the CARES Act provided much-needed relief for those with federal student loans, millions of people with private & non-federal student loans were left out.  I’m happy to announce that, as of today, nearly 140,000 more student loan borrowers in Illinois will now get relief.
