  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is considering intervening to stop the release of some prisoners amid the coronavirus pandemic.
  Correctional facilities in states such as California, Michigan and Pennsylvania have begun releasing certain inmates as the prisons face a shortage of medical supplies.
  Trump said Thursday that “we don’t like it.”
  The president added that “we’re looking to see if I have the right to stop it in some cases.”
  He did not elaborate what measures, or under what legal authority, he would take to stop or reverse the releases.
