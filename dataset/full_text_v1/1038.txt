  Santa Clara County, California, public health officials, citing an increase in the number of coronavirus cases that could be community spread,  announced an order banning gatherings  of more than 1,000 people for three weeks.
  The order does not apply to airports, offices, grocery stores or shopping malls. But it could affect the San Jose Sharks hockey team, which said in a statement Monday night that it was aware of the new guidelines and would adhere to them.
