  Brazil recorded its deadliest day for COVID-19 with 881 confirmed deaths â€” as the total death toll has passed 12,000.
  The country has documented more than 178,000 cases of the coronavirus.
  The actual number of cases and deaths in the country are likely far higher than the official counts, since Brazil is only testing people with symptoms who've gone to the hospital.
