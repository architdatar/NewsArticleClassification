  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday said he will speak with Mayor Bill de Blasio about putting the country's biggest city under a curfew after some weekend protests over George Floyd's death turned violent.
  "Legally, I can impose a curfew," Cuomo said. "I'm not at that point, but I know something has to happen because last night was not acceptable and the night before was not acceptable."
  At his coronavirus briefing Monday, de Blasio said that he does not believe a curfew is needed but it is being considered as an option.
  De Blasio said he will consult with Police Commissioner Dermot Shea and the governor.
  Earlier Monday, Shea said he did not think a curfew would work.
  "The problem is: People need to listen to a curfew, and that’s not going to happen," he said on the “TODAY” show. "If people think it will, they don't understand what's going on."
