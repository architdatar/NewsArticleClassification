  The NHL announced plans Monday to  allow small groups of players , no more than six, to gather for workouts in early June, with an eye toward restarting play and resuming its coronavirus-halted season.
  A league memo did not say when  in early June this "Phase 2"  Â would begin or how long it would last before games are actually played.
  Phase 3 would  be a full training camp and Phase 4 the playing of actual games. Players and club owners have agreed to the framework of a  24-team playoff system .
