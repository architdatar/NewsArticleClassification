  Brazil surpassed Russia in total number of confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, with 330,890 cases according to Johns Hopkins University data.
  The South American country now as the second-highest number of cases globally behind only the United States — which has reported 1.6 million cases as of Saturday.
  The worst-hit nation in Latin America also reported 1,001 deaths over the previous 24 hours, bringing its total death toll to more than 21,000. The news came as states and cities across Brazil debate whether to loosen restrictive measures introduced to limit the spread of the virus, or implement stricter lockdowns.
  This comes after Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro unveiled rules on Wednesday expanding the prescription of chloroquine — the predecessor of an anti-malaria drug  promoted by President Donald Trump  — for coronavirus patients  despite a lack of clinical proof  that it is effective.
