  With an estimated  one-third of the world's population participating in some form of isolation , trains, trucks and humans aren't pounding the pavement as they would normally, and scientists who measure the earth's vibrations say the calm is palpable.
  Since late March, the planet's "seismic noise" has been reduced because of stay-at-home measures, the Royal Observatory of Belgium noted.
  "The earth continues shaking," it said on  Twitter . "Ground movements at frequencies 1-20 Hz, mainly due to human activity (cars, trains, industries,...) are much lower since the implementation of the containment measures by the government."
  Similar reductions have been noted in the  United Kingdom ,  Paris  and  Los Angeles .
  Dramatic reduction of seismic noise in  @Paris  due to the  #COVID19   #lockdown . Noise measured at CURIE seismic station  @IPGP . Thanks to  @seismotom  and  @obspy  for the  @ProjectJupyter  notebook:  https://t.co/hfQ1mxtxtl   And thanks Parisians for staying home!  #ResteChezToi   #StayHome   pic.twitter.com/RTqJYiTWYN
