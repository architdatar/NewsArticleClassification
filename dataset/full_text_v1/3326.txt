  France is to be divided into red or green zones as the nation's lockdown is eased, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Wednesday as he presented plans for the next phase of coronavirus measures. 
  All departments -- which are administrative regions in  France  -- will be given designations of red or green, depending on three criteria:
  A red department means “lockdown relaxation will take a more strict form,” Philippe said at France's National Assembly.
  “The Director General of Health will present the map every evening with the results, department by department,” said Philippe.
  France has recorded more than 169,000 cases and almost 24,000 deaths, according to figures from  Johns Hopkins University .
