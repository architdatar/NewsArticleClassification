  White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said during Wednesday’s press briefing that  AstraZeneca’s recent pause on a coronavirus vaccine trial  showed “science is guiding the way on a vaccine.”
  McEnany called their pause “a routine response when you see an adverse effect.”
  McEnany also said that an end of year coronavirus vaccine is still the goal, despite the pause, and disputed that there was ever an Election Day deadline.
  “Our timing is not about the election. It is about saving lives and by the end of the year has always been our goal, but of course a safe and effective vaccine, we will take it as quickly as we can get it,” she said.
