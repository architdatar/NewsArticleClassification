  The White House is setting up a hotline for lawmakers to help with communication about the coronavirus epidemic, sources familiar with the move say.
  The hotline was an initiative by new White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, the former representative from North Carolina who officially  entered his new role this week , a source familiar with the matter told NBC News.
  Politico reported  on the hotline earlier Thursday.
  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., mentioned the hotline on a Democratic caucus call Thursday, a person on the call said.
  In an email sent to Chiefs of Staff for House Democrats, which has been viewed by NBC News, Meadows wrote that the hotline should be “used only for emergencies” and should “be distributed to Members and Senators only.”
