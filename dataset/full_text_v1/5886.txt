  “In an excess of caution… because people were together for a significant part of the day, we have instructed the participants of that meeting to self-quarantine by working from home for the next 14 days,” the memo said, according to Page Six.
  SiriusXM reportedly sent a follow-up memo after the Post published its initial story.
  “You may have seen a published report in the New York Post about SiriusXM and the coronavirus. Here is simply what is going on: at a meeting yesterday, we realized a handful of team members had stopped over for a few hours in an airport in Japan. That is all. There is no evidence of the coronavirus among our employees,” the second memo said, according to the Post.
  SiriusXM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
