  San Francisco will prohibit anyone from leaving their homes except for essential needs beginning at midnight Monday night, Mayor London Breed said.
  “Necessary government functions & essential stores will remain open,” Breed  said  in a tweet. “These steps are based on the advice of public health experts to slow the spread of #COVID19.” 
  The restriction is among the most extreme measures taken nationwide in response to the pandemic and echoes similar measures in European and Asian cities. San Francisco officials were planning a briefing at 1 p.m. PT, Breed said. 
  “The most important thing you can do is remain home as much as possible. There is no need to rush out for food or supplies, as these stores will remain open,” she added. “We'll meet this challenge and we'll get through it together.” 
  Similar orders will apply in six Bay Area counties covering 6.7 million people,  the San Francisco Chronicle reported .
