  New York City Fire Department first responders on Friday night serenaded medical workers outside NYU Langone Health, an academic medical center in Manhattan.
  Sandra Pérez Baos, a postdoctoral researcher at the New York University facility,  tweeted  a video of the event, which she later said took place at 7 p.m.
  Ladder trucks, rescue rigs and ambulances are lined up, emergency lights flashing, sirens blaring, and air horns sounding — a show of appreciation for  an overwhelmed system  — as mask-wearing medical workers watch and listen.
  On Friday,  the city transmitted an emergency alert  to cellphones to ask licensed health care workers to volunteer to work at coronavirus-impacted medical facilities. The virus-related death toll in the city Saturday was nearly 1,900.
