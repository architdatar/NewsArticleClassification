  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he will be working with governors on a plan to reopen the country, seeming to back away from an assertion yesterday that he had the sole authority to determine when business should return to normal. 
  “What I do is going to be done in conjunction with governors,” Trump said Tuesday. “We’ll be doing that in a little while.” 
  Trump made the remarks at a meeting in the White House with COVID-19 survivors, who were spaced out around the large table in the Cabinet Room. The participants shared stories about their experience with the virus that at times contradicted the White House's positive narrative. 
  Michigan State Rep. Karen Whitsett said she believes taking hydroxychloroquine,  an unproven treatment  that Trump has widely touted, aided her recovery. She also told the president she has lost several extended family members to the virus, including one who died after being turned away from numerous hospitals. 
  A day earlier, Trump said there was no shortage of hospital beds because of the administration’s response. 
  Another participant talked about the struggle to get a test in early March, saying that it took going to the emergency room and saying that he fever and had been to San Francisco for him to able to get a test. Trump said at that time that anyone who wanted a test could get a test.
