  New cases of the coronavirus in India topped 6,000 for a second consecutive day, marking another record jump for the South Asian country in a 24-hour period.
  India reported 6,654 new cases on Saturday, bringing the nationwide total to 125,102, including 3,720 deaths.Â The rate of infection in the country of 1.3 billion has risen as a two-month lockdown has eased.
  States with relatively few cases have seen spikes in recent days as residents, including migrant workers traveling on special trains, have returned home.
  Authorities in the northeastern border state of Assam introduced criminal charges on Saturday for quarantine violators after more than 100 people in state quarantine facilities tested positive for COVID-19.
