  Sen. Rand Paul, the only  senator known to have contracted COVID-19 , defended his decision not to wear a mask on Capitol Hill Tuesday, citing his recovery from the disease. 
  “I have immunity. I’ve already had the virus, so I can’t get it again and I can’t give it to anybody,” Paul, R-Ky., told reporters,  referring to his March diagnosis . “I can’t get it again, nor can I transmit. So of all the people you’ll meet here, I’m about the only safe person in Washington.”
  Paul's claims are unproven. Medical experts do not yet know what kind of immunity recovered patients have to COVID-19.
  Broadly speaking, some infections result in lifelong immunity (think chicken pox) while other infections will produce short-term immunity in recovered patients. And while many experts do believe some kind of immunity will come with recovery, there are  reports of recovered COVID patients who have tested positive again after testing negative .
