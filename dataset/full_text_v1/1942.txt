  The medical director of the National Health Service in England said Tuesday that hospital admissions were “stabilizing and plateauing” in London and other areas. 
  In the British government’s daily briefing, Stephen Powis said the benefits of social distancing measures imposed by the government were beginning to manifest in the stabilization of hospital admissions. However, he warned that the number of deaths would be the last figures to level off. 
  Meanwhile, U.K. Treasury chief Rishi Sunak addressed a report by the government’s independent economics forecaster published Tuesday that suggested the U.K. economy could shrink by 35 percent in the second quarter of this year and that unemployment could rise by more than 2 million. 
  Sunak said it was “just one potential scenario” but added that there would be more “tough times” ahead, warning that the government wouldn’t be able to protect every business and household.
