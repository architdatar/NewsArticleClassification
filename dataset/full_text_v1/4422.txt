  WASHINGTON — Massachusetts holds its primaries Tuesday, including one of the  biggest intraparty Senate contests  still left on the calendar, as well as another challenge from the left against a sitting House Democratic committee chairman.
  The  Massachusetts Senate primary  features incumbent Sen. Ed Markey — one of the longest-serving members of Congress (first joining the House in 1973) — and the scion of the Kennedy family in Joe Kennedy III.
  From the start, Kennedy cast himself as part of the next generation of progressive voices despite his few policy differences with Markey. And early on in the campaign, Kennedy seemed to have the edge in polling.
  But Markey closed the gap in recent months with a hard embrace of his progressive chops, debate performances, viral videos, and a boost from progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and affiliated  groups that are rallying around their ally and promoting his work on issues like the Green New Deal.
  Now, all of the recent public polling  shows Markey with the advantage .
  Kennedy has had the TV/radio advertising edge over Markey, both in spending by the campaign and its allied super PAC. And he recently snagged the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which frustrated progressives who saw the move as the establishment coming after one of their own. 
  Also taking place Tuesday is a competitive Massachusetts House primary. Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. — Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee —  is being challenged  from the left by Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse.
  In August, students at University of Massachusetts at Amherst  accused Morse  of inappropriate relationships with college students, but later came evidence that the charges  might have been manufactured  up by Neal supporters, though the Neal campaign has denied any involvement.
  Neal has the endorsements of Pelosi, as well as his home state's  Republican Gov. Charlie Baker .
