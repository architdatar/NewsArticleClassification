  Dr. Anthony Fauci,  the nation's top infectious diseases expert , said Sunday that earlier efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. "obviously" could have saved lives but top health officials faced "a lot of pushback about shutting things down."
  Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was responding on CNN's "State of the Union" to a  New York Times report  stating that President Donald Trump's top public health officials concluded by the third week of February that they should recommend to the president a new approach to  COVID-19 , which included social distancing steps.
  But, according to The Times, the White House "focused instead on messaging and crucial additional weeks went by before their views were reluctantly accepted by the president — time when the virus spread largely unimpeded."
  "We look at it from a pure health standpoint," Fauci told CNN. "We make a recommendation. Often, the recommendation is taken. Sometimes, it's not. But ... it is what it is. We are where we are right now."
