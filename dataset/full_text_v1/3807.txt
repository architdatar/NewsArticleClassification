  Iceland’s government announced tougher coronavirus-related restrictions Thursday following new outbreaks in the country. 
    The new rules  take effect starting tomorrow. Here's a look at them: 
  If those measures aren’t sufficient to halt new outbreaks, the government has said it will look at further action in relation to border controls.  
  Some background:  Iceland has been praised for its handling of the virus, its extensive testing capacity, and its tracking and tracing methods. 
  The current rules were due to be relaxed even further on Aug. 4, but new outbreaks in the country have instead resulted in the new stricter measures. 
  The announcement comes a day before a long weekend in Iceland and one of its busiest travel periods of the year.
