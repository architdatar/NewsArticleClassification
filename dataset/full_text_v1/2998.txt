  President Trump has repeatedly insisted that the U.S. is doing more testing than anywhere else. But this claim needs more context.
  "We have done more tests, by far, than any country in the world, by far," Trump said during a news conference Monday, in response to a question about the U.S. lagging behind in testing residents "per capita."
  It is true that the U.S. has run more tests than any other country. But Trump does not acknowledge that the U.S. is not testing the same share of its population as other countries, a key measure. The White House said Sunday that about 894,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered. In a country of 327 million people, that’s about 1 in 366 people who are getting tested. On Monday, the White House said there had been more than a million tests; that's 1 in 327 people who are getting tested.
  South Korea, for instance,  has done 410,564 tests as of Tuesday .  But South Korea has a population of 51 million people, which means they’re testing a much larger share of the population — one in every 124 people.
  Trump argued Monday that the U.S. is a large country and there are areas that wouldn't need ramped-up testing. But even in the hardest hit areas — like New York City — many cannot get tested.
