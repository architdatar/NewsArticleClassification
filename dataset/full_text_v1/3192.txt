  FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said Tuesday that his agency planned to use its authorities under the Defense Production Act “to get our hands on” coronavirus test kits. 
  “We're going to use it for about 60,000 test kits, and so we're really going to use the allocation portion of the DPA, and again many different levers and options in that,” he said in an interview on CNN. 
  Gaynor said that they were also going to insert “DPA language” into contracts for 500 million masks. 
  President Donald Trump has come under fire in recent days for not using the powers of the DPA to authorize the mass production of critical supplies.
