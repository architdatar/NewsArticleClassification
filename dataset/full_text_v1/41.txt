  Asked Tuesday about plans to reopen New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, "In this case, I'm going to declare myself a conservative."
  "This is all aboutÂ safety and all about health," de Blasio said. "My profound concern is that if we do this the wrong way, if we do it prematurely, we will see a resurgence of this disease."
  De Blasio said "we would be fools" to ignore the warnings, including from places that acted a little prematurely and are paying for it.
