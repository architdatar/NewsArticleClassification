  Southern Nevada's extreme summer heart could be key to curbing coronavirus, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said Friday, insisting her city should be at the "forefront of America's 'reopening.'"
  Goodman,  widely derided  this week for saying Las Vegas should be a  "control group"  for ending  stay-at-home orders , held firm on Friday that the tourism hub has to be reopened for business soon.
  "Although it has not been clearly determined as to the effect that extreme warmth will have on the virus, it is assumed that it shall deter its ferocity,"  she said in a statement .  "We certainly are looking forward to having out desert heat provide that required substantiation. Our hot summer coupled with our unique economy  compel us to be at the forefront of America's 'reopening.'"
  The mercury regularly tops 100 degrees throughout  June, July and August  in Las Vegas.
