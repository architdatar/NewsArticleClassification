  The city that never sleeps seems to be abiding by officials' orders in regard to bar and restaurant service, at least judging by New York Police Department figures.
  The NYPD said Saturday that checks on 6,900 bars and restaurants Friday night resulted in no citations. "NO summonses or arrests, and NO enforcement action needed," it said on  Twitter .
  The department said 4,900 of the locations were closed. 
  On Friday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo unveiled his orders for all nonessential employees of businesses to stay home and for  bars and restaurants  to remain open only for delivery and takeout.
  New Yorkers: Always adapt. Always at our best in a crisis.   Last night the NYPD visited 6,900 bars & restaurants. NO summonses or arrests, and NO enforcement action needed. 4,900 locations were already closed.   Thank you, NYC  pic.twitter.com/qwc101YGSR 
  That same day, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said the city is  the American "epicenter" of the virus , called on "100 percent" of residents to stay home unless they are exempted.
