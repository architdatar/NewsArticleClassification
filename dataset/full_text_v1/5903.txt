  Smoking and using electronic cigarettes makes people more vulnerable to coronavirus, New York City officials warned Sunday. 
  Although a history of smoking is not considered one of the preexisting conditions that define those who are most vulnerable to the virus, it is a serious factor, Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a Sunday press conference. 
  "If you are a smoker or a vaper, this is a very good time to stop that habit and we will help you," de Blasio said. "Our health department and our colleagues in the state have a lot they can offer people who want to quit smoking, who want to quit vaping."
  Officials are still most concerned about those over the age of 50 who have conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, cancer, diabetes and disorders that compromise someone's immune system. 
  De Blasio said that the city has a total of 13 confirmed coronavirus cases, seven of which were identified in the last three days. At least 146 tests have come back negative and another 76 tests still are outstanding. 
  The city could see at least 100 or more confirmed cases over the next two or three weeks, de Blasio said. 
  "We have to be prepared for that reality," de Blasio said.
