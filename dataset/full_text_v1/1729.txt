  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday the coronavirus is “far more” than a public health emergency, explaining it is also an economic and social crisis that is “fast becoming a human rights crisis.”
  #COVID19  is a public health emergency — that is fast becoming a human rights crisis. People — and their rights — must be front and centre. My new report on how human rights can and must guide  #coronavirus  response & recovery:  https://t.co/CmYirKbsci   pic.twitter.com/rssMV0MPBg 
  The U.N. chief said in a video message that there is discrimination in the delivery of public services to tackle COVID-19 and there are “structural inequalities that impede access to them.” However, the chief didn't mention any countries by name. 
  Guterres released a  U.N. report  on Thursday where he warned of “rising ethno-nationalism, populism, authoritarianism and a push back against human rights in some countries,” saying  “the crisis can provide a pretext to adopt repressive measures for purposes unrelated to the pandemic.” The report called for governments to be transparent, responsive and accountable while “protecting human rights and the rule of law” in the time of the outbreak.
