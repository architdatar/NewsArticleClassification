  One of the wildest weeks in the history of the U.S. stock market ended on Friday with major indexes down sharply as concern about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak persists.
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 256 points on Friday, or about 1 percent. The Dow remains about 3,600 points below its peak in mid-February.Â 
  The broader S&P 500 index declined 1.7 percent on Friday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.9 percent.
  It was another week of volatile trading on Wall Street. All 4 major indexes closed down today, though none closing as low as they had earlier in the week. The Dow slid more than 450 points at session lows, but saw some gains to close down just 254 points.  https://t.co/xk0ijnQDsL   pic.twitter.com/OrmHTnR9hs
