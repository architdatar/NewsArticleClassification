WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has signed an executive order making it a crime to excessively stockpile personal protective equipment that is needed by medical personnel fighting the coronavirus pandemic.
  Attorney General William Barr says the Justice Department has already launched investigations into people who are hoarding supplies and price gouging. 
  “If you are sitting on a warehouse with surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door,” he said. 
  The executive order allows the president to designate some items as “scarce.” No specific items have been identified yet and the Justice Department will work with Health and Human Services to enforce the president’s order.
