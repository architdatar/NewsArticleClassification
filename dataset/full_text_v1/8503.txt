  Wisconsin, which had  one confirmed case of coronavirus  in early February, is now able to test suspected samples at the state lab in Madison and at the City of Milwaukee health lab.
  Faster test results will help local health departments monitor people suspected of having the virus and other people who may have been exposed to it, said Jeanne Ayers, administrator for the Wisconsin Division of Public Health.
  Test samples previously were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Positive test results identified by the two labs in the state will now be presumed positive and sent to the CDC for confirmation.
