  Yemen has recorded its first confirmed case of  coronavirus  on Friday, the country's supreme national emergency committee  tweeted . 
  The patient is being treated and is in a stable condition in the ⁧‫⁩ Hadhramaut governorate, the national emergency committee for the disease said. The case in the war-torn country has stoked fears that an outbreak could devastate an already crippled health care system. 
  The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iran-backed Houthi rebels  declared a cease-fire this week on humanitarian grounds  to prevent the spread of the pandemic — possibly paving the way to a peace agreement.
