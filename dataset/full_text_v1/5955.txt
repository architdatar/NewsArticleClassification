  Spain's death toll from the growing coronavirus pandemic has now topped 2,000, only  three days after its number of deaths hit 1,000 . 
  The country's health ministry said Monday there are now 33,090 confirmed coronavirus cases and 2,182 deaths in the country. 
  Spain, the second hardest-hit country in Europe after Italy, sought to extend its state of emergency Sunday by another two weeks until April 11. Announced on March 14, it was intended to last 15 days, and bars people from all but essential outings. The extension would need to be approved by Parliament. 
  “We are at war,” the country's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told a news briefing.
