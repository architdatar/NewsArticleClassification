  That is, unless they receive special permission.
  Some overseas visitors and businesspeople will be allowed to enter the country and work there if they can demonstrate that they will provide a benefit to the New Zealand economy.
  Acclaimed film director James Cameron is one of those. He and his crew have been given permission by the New Zealand government to work inside the country on "Avatar 2," CNN learned today.
  The first "Avatar" movie is the highest-grossing film in history, bringing in roughly $2.8 billion at the worldwide box office in 2009.
  The release date for "Avatar 2" has been bumped from December 18, 2020 to December, 17, 2021.
