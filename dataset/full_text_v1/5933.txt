  But starting Monday, some beaches in the city's eastern suburbs will be open for "exercise purposes only," according to the local authorities. 
  Randwick City Council said Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly beaches would reopen for activities including "sand jogging and walking, swimming, surfing and other exercise activities." 
  Three weeks ago, all Randwick City beaches were closed to discourage large groups congregating at the beach.
  Not back to normal:  Even though beachgoers are allowed back, they must maintain a distance of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) between each other, limit groups to two people and move on once they have completed their exercise. Sitting or sun-bathing on the sand will not be permitted, the council said in a news release.
  Additionally, two beaches on Queensland's Gold Coast -- Surfers Paradise and Coolangatta -- reopened on Monday.
