  Online interest in purchasing drugs touted by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk spiked in late March after both weighed in, a new analysis published by the journal  JAMA Internal Medicine  found.
  Musk tweeted  March 16 that antimalarial drug chloroquine was "maybe worth considering," and Trump said March 19 that chloroquine and related drug hydroxychloroquine showed  "very, very encouraging early results,"  though Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,  disagreed .
  University researchers based at Oxford, Harvard, UC San Diego and Johns Hopkins measured a 1,389 percent surge in online searches about purchasing hydroxychloroquine after Trump first touted the drug. "This could be evidence that thousands of Americans were interested in purchasing these drugs," study co-author Mark Dredze of Johns Hopkins University said in a statement.
  In April, a drumbeat of headlines  dashed high hopes for the drugs  and for a combination also touted by Trump, one including antibiotic azithromycin. In fact the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said  the drugs should not be tried outside a hospital setting .
  On March 22  an Arizona man died after ingesting chloroquine phosphate , a parasite treatment for fish, believing it would protect him from coronavirus. His wife said the couple believed the substance was the drug endorsed by the president.
