  A woman  played a "twisted prank" at a Pennsylvania grocery store Wednesday by purposely coughing on about $35,000 worth of food , which had to be thrown out, the supermarket said.
  The co-owner of the Gerrity's supermarket in Hanover Township said authorities were working to get the woman tested for coronavirus. 
  The Hanover Township Police Department said it is investigating the incident and that charges would be filed against the suspect, who underwent a mental health evaluation.
