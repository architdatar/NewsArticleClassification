  Los Angeles County is extending its stay-at-home order until May 15 at the earliest with the possibility of extending it into the summer, officials announced Friday.Â The order had been set to expire on April 19.
  Public health officials said social distancing has helped flatten the coronavirus curve but more is needed to protect the county's 12 million residents. More than 8,400 residents have contracted COVID-19, according to the County of Los Angeles Public Health Department.
  Public health officials warned Friday that lifting the stay-at-home order now could result in nearly 96 percent of residents being infected.
