  George Floyd,  who died during an arrest in Minneapolis  on May 25, had coronavirus.
  The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s full autopsy report released Wednesday said Floyd first tested positive for the virus April 3, nearly two months prior to his death. A prior release of the county autopsy attributed Floyd's cause of death as a "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression."
  It also listed other "significant" conditions, including hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use.
