  Health care systems across Africa could collapse under the added weight of  the new coronavirus pandemic , the International Committee of the Red Cross has warned.  
  So far, Africa has been the  continent least affected by the contagious virus . However, if measures to contain the virus are not taken immediately it could be devastating for the continent’s people, Patrick Youssef, the  ICRC’s  incoming regional director for Africa, has warned.
