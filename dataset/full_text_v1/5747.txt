  Senate Minority Leader Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday he'll introduce a proposal for coronavirus legislation that would provide “at least $750 billion to wage war against COVID-19."
   “We will need big, bold, immediate federal action to deal with this crisis,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “The proposal will get money directly into the hands of families that need it most, and among other priorities, include federal funding to address hospital and treatment capacity issues, expand unemployment insurance and increase Medicaid funding."
  The measures would also include funding emergency child care, help for schools with remote learning and mortgage and student loan protections, Schumer said. 
  Schumer's statement comes as the Senate awaits other  emergency coronavirus legislation from the House . 
  The first coronavirus legislation was an $8.3 billion package signed into law on March 6.
