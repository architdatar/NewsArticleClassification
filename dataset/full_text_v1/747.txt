  Attorney General Bill Barr on Tuesday defended the federal law enforcement and military presence in Washington, D.C. after  the city's mayor rebuked him and President Donald Trump  for “inflaming” and “adding to the grievances” of protestors.
  Barr, however, argued that a show of force was necessary because it looked as if “the United States was on the brink of losing control of its capital city" after police clashed with protesters over days following the death of George Floyd. 
  “Had the recent demonstrations remained peaceful and within the control of local law enforcement, the President would never have had any need to augment existing resources for the purpose of restoring law and order," Barr wrote, adding that law enforcement personnel were operating within the scope of the law.
  D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, sent a letter to Trump, Barr and two mayors last week  asking for the removal  of federal law enforcement and various National Guard troops. She also criticized the use of federal personnel patrolling the streets and the use of helicopters to disperse crowds.
  Barr also defended police  forcefully pushing back peaceful protesters  outside the White House last week in which rubber bullets, pepper spray, tear gas, and flash-bang grenades were used to make way for Trump to pose for photos with a Bible at St. John's Episcopal Church.
