  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced Tuesday that an additional $6.2 billion in federal grants will be made available to colleges and universities for remote learning programs, staff training and building out IT capacity.
  The boost in higher education funding comes after the Education Department  announced earlier this month  that nearly $6.3 billion would be made available to colleges for students who need help with necessities, including books and housing, during the coronavirus pandemic.
  The latest round of money is also coming out of the  $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act  that President Donald Trump signed in March.
  While the Education Department said it made the initial cash grants available "quickly," and there's been an increase in eligible colleges seeking the money for their neediest students,  Politico reported Monday  that less than 1 percent of the $6.3 billion was released to schools this month. Education advocates have blamed bureaucracy and confusion over the rules.
