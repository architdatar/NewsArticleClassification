China responded to President Trump's use of the term "Chinese virus," with a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying that the U.S. should play a "constructive role" to safeguard international public health. 
  “We hope that the United States will respect objective facts, respect international public opinion, do its own thing, stop constantly shifting its attitude, stop slandering other countries, and shifting responsibilities,” Geng Shuang, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday. 
  The president has defended his use of term,  saying in a press conference, "it's not racist at all, no.  It comes from China." He was photographed on reading from notes on Thursday at a coronavirus press conference  with the word "corona" crossed out and replaced with "Chinese."
