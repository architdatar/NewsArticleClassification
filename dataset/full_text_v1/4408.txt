  Stay-at-home orders in  Maryland will be lifted on Friday , allowing some businesses to partially reopen for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic emerged, Gov. Larry Hogan announced.
  Starting at 5 p.m. on Friday, retail stores, manufacturing operations, barber shops and hair salons may take customers at 50 percent capacity, the governor said on Wednesday.
  Hogan said decreasing numbers of hospitalizations and deaths allow his state to take a first step toward reopening. But the governor promised he wouldn't hesitate to issue new lockdown orders if coronavirus cases suddenly spike: "We remain ready to quickly and decisively respond to any changes  to the facts on the ground."
