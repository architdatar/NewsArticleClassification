  A new report from cybersecurity firm  Jumbo Privacy  claims that Care19, a contact-tracing app created to track the spread of coronavirus in North Dakota, is sending user data to third-party services, including location service Foursquare.
  FAQs about the app published  on North Dakota’s official site  say that "information is 100% anonymous,” and that “the application does not have any information that is tied to an individual person.”
  Jumbo disagrees.
  "They share the IDFA with Foursquare, which means it’s not anonymous,” said Jumbo Privacy CEO Pierre Valade. "It’s a unique ID tied to your phone.” 
  North Dakota is one of a few states, including South Dakota and Utah, that have built their own contact-tracing apps.
  Foursquare said in a statement that while it receives Care19 data, it does not use it in any way and promptly discards it. ProudCrowd did not immediately return a request for comment.
