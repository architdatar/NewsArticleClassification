  Hoti is in good health and will stay home for the next two weeks, following his doctor's recommendation, his press office said.
  "Indeed, we have a difficult situation here, but the government and health institutions are doing everything they can to manage and prevent this pandemic," the press office told CNN in an e-mail.
