  A Michigan priest who used a water gun to bless parishioners with holy water has gone viral and been given meme-treatment by the internet. 
  Father Tim Pelc of the St. Ambrose Parish in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan hosted a drive-thru church service for Holy Saturday. In order to comply with social distancing guidelines, the priest decided to use a squirt gun full of holy water, according to a  Facebook post from the church . 
  The priest’s ingenuity has struck a chord on the internet, with the photo garnering more than 120,000 retweets and more than 500,000 likes  on Twitter . It has even made its way to Reddit’s  photoshop battle  page, where users superimposed Father Pelc onto a photo of  firefighters battling a fire  and onto a movie poster dubbed “ The Good, The Bad and The Holy Spirit ,” a play on “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” starring Clint Eastwood.
  “It’s an internet law: once a post or photo about you goes viral, you must end up in a meme,” St. Ambrose Parish  wrote on its Facebook page . “Now it’s happened to Fr. Tim, who wowed the world with his unique holy water squirt gun, blessing food on Holy Saturday."
