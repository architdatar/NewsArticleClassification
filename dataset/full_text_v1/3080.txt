  Dr. Anthony Fauci called the global coronavirus pandemic “unprecedented” and “the worst nightmare.”  
  “Your worst nightmare, the perfect storm,” he added. “I think 50 years from now, people are going to be reflecting historically on this, the way we used to reflect on the 1918 outbreak,” Fauci said.
