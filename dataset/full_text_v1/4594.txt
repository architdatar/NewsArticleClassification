  California cities are increasingly turning to masks to help stop the spread of coronavirus. On Thursday evening, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore tweeted that residents should expect to see officers "wearing either surgical masks or non-medical face coverings while in public."
  The announcement came a day after  L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti urged residents to use cloth face coverings  outdoors, but to avoid medical-grade gear, such as N95 masks, because health workers need them.  Bay Area health officials  issued a  similar recommendation  Thursday.
  Gov. Gavin Newsom has said  the state will not yet mandate masks , but San Diego County health officials on Thursday did --  for workers who have contact with the public , including those at grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations
  President Donald Trump on Thursday said to expect a recommendation on masks soon. "A recommendation is coming out, we will see what that recommendation is," he said. White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said masks can supplement social distancing guidelines, but fears they could give Americans "a false sense of security."
  Effective today, you may see your local LAPD officers wearing either surgical masks or non-medical face coverings while in public. This is for our safety, and for your safety. Coupled with safe social distancing, we will continue to protect and serve through this crisis.  pic.twitter.com/QL0QMyIPyL
