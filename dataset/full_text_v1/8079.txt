  The United States doesn’t have the capacity to test and trace Covid-19 cases — a key measure the country will need to start the process of reopening, according to the nation’s top infectious disease doctor.
  Fauci’s comments come the day after President Trump promised guidelines “soon” aimed at governors to reopen the economy. 
  He added that opening the country on May 1, after federal social distancing guidelines are set to expire, is “a bit overly optimistic” for many places in the US. This process, he said, would likely have to occur on a “rolling” basis and not simultaneously across the country. A key worry, he said, was that the US would see new outbreaks in places where officials may not be able to swiftly test and trace contacts of those who are infected. 
  These concerns reflect those New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters on Monday – that states lack sufficient capacity to test on their own.
  "It's not as simple as saying states should test,” Cuomo said. They can't do it without the federal government. There are not enough tests now, and there's not enough reagents, and there's not enough medical equipment.” 
  Referring to other governors joining over the phone from states including Connecticut and New Jersey, he added, “Any one of these governors would tell you ... they don't have the testing capacity, and they can't gather it themselves.”
  Fauci stopped short of telling The Associated Press that a second wave of infection isn’t inevitable but said, “If you mean it goes way down and then come September, October, November, we have another peak – I have to say I would not be surprised. I would hope that if and when that occurs, that we jump all over it in a much, much more effective way than we have in these past few months.”
