  Gowdy said that the answer for the U.S. is to become self-sufficient during a crisis. He also said that pharmaceuticals and protective gear are a national security issue.
  “Maybe the answer is for the United States to be less dependent upon other countries for things that keep us from dying that obviates the need to rely on an act.
  “Then we don’t have to ask anyone to do anything that they’re not currently doing because they are already being making this stuff in this country.
  “I think that’s the long-term answer that comes out of this pandemic,” Gowdy said.
