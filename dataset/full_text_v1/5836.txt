  Two U.S. Senators said Sunday that they are in self-quarantine  after Sen. Rand Paul tested positive  for COVID-19.
  Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Mike Lee of Colorado, both Republicans, said in separate statements that they are undertaking the measures because of their exposure to the Kentucky lawmaker.

  After consulting with a congressional doctor, Lee said he would not take a test for the disease. Romney, who said he sat next to Paul for extended periods, said he will be tested. Neither are showing symptoms of COVID-19.
  Another lawmaker, Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.,  said Paul had acted irresponsibly  after going to the Senate gym while waiting to find out if he'd contracted the disease. “You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results,” Sinema tweeted. “It endangers others & likely increases the spread of the virus.”
