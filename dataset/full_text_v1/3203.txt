  The first California-based U.S. sailor has tested positive for coronavirus, Navy officials said Saturday.
  The results were received Friday, the Navy said in a statement. The patient employed at Naval Base San Diego would mark "the first positive case for a Sailor in California," the military branch said.
  The service member and those who have had close contact with the patient were isolated at home, the Navy said. The branch was investigating other possible contacts with the sailor.
  Marine Corps Air Station Miramar this week said two U.S. Marines based there are presumed positive. The San Diego installation is the quarantine site for  hundreds of evacuees from virus-plagued cruise ship Grand Princess .
