  Summer travel will look different once people start flying again, according to new details from the Transportation Security Administration that aim to reduce the amount of person-to-person contact.
  The federal agency said Thursday  in a statement  that travelers will now have to place their print or mobile boarding passes on scanners themselves in order to avoid a touch point.
  Passengers will also be required to put any food items in a clear plastic bag in order to "lessen the likelihood that a TSA officer will need to open the carry-on bag."
  Security checkpoints will also include "visual reminders of appropriate spacing," and staggered lanes, in order to allow for social distancing.
  The TSA said it is also encouraging, but not mandating, the use of face masks during the check-in procedure, though agents will be wearing masks and changing gloves between pat-downs.
