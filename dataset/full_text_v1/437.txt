  Almost all of Germany's 83 million population will be required to wear face coverings in public spaces as of Monday, according to announcements on federal state websites.
  Germany is a decentralized country so every state has its own set of rules. 
  Here's a breakdown of when and where you need to wear a mask: 
  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government urgently recommended citizens to wear masks in public when it loosened some of the restrictions placed on public life to combat the coronavirus pandemic a week ago. 
  But all German states have since separately enacted laws making the wearing of face coverings a requirement in some public spaces.
