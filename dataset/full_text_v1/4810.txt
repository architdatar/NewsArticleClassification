  New York state had 799 deaths from coronavirus in one day, its highest daily toll yet in the pandemic, which bringing the total to 7,067, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at his press briefing Thursday.
  The governor said the state will bring in additional funeral directors "to deal with the number of people who have passed."
  At the same time as deaths have risen, the number of net new hospitalizations is down to 200, the lowest daily increase since the crisis in the state began, Cuomo said.
  "We are flattening the curve by what we're doing," the governor said, referring to the state's closing of nonessential businesses and social distancing orders.
  "You can't relax," he said. "If we stop acting the way weâ€™re acting you will see those numbers go up."
