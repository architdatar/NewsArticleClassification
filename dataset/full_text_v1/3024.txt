  President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that just one study counters  his belief that hydroxychloroquine can help prevent or treat  COVID-19, and that was because the patients who were given the drug were already very ill.
  “If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead,” Trump said, referring to a  study of veterans taking the drug that linked it to a higher risk of death. 
  This is not true. There have been several studies into the effect of hydroxychloroquine on patients sick with the disease caused by coronavirus that have found the drug to be ineffective or harmful to patients fighting coronavirus.
  A  study out of China found that patients with mild to moderate  COVID-19 who were given hydroxychloroquine and standard care for COVID-19 fared worse than those given standard care, while  French researchers in another study  found that treatment with hydroxychloroquine didn’t stop the progression of the disease.  A study in New York that was funded by the National Institutes of Health  found no adverse or beneficial effects of the administration of hydroxychloroquine on coronavirus patients.  Another study in Brazil  was stopped early after patients developed fatal, irregular heartbeats.
