  A Fort Smith, Arkansas, concert venue grudgingly said it would delay a country music show that it had scheduled for Friday, days before coronavirus restrictions in the state would allow it.
  TempleLive will instead seek to have the Travis McCready show moved to Monday, when some indoor events can begin to be held. The move came after the governor said  ¬†and after a venue official said the state alcohol commission "ripped our permits and licenses off the wall."
  "It doesn't feel like America to me," Mike Brown of TempleLive said at a news conference. He said the venue will apply to move the show to Monday "against our will."
  Gov. Asa Hutchinson noted that the show was scheduled for three days before indoor events would be permitted. "You can‚Äôt just arbitrarily determine when the restrictions are lifted," he said.¬†
  The Arkansas Department of Health  requires a plan to be approved for indoor events with 50 people or more.¬†
  The event had been announced in late April. Brown said that churches had been allowed to open and they wanted to be treated the same as other places now permitted.¬†"At the end of the day we fought the law and the laws won," he said.

  The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on April 14.

  In total, China has reported 4,633 deaths among 82,933 cases since the virus was first detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan.

The government plans to hold the ceremonial parliament‚Äôs annual session later this month, but with highly limited access for journalists and others.

  The most comprehensive national study to date has found that convalescent plasma appears to be safe to use on COVID-19 patients, a promising development in the race to find a treatment for the deadly virus. But the study didn't determine whether the treatment works.
  A team of more than 5,000 doctors from over 2,000 hospitals and laboratories have been testing¬† , which involves transfusing the antibody-rich blood serum of recovered COVID-19 patients into people who are battling the illness.
  Of the 5,000 seriously ill patients who received blood plasma transfusions for the study, fewer than 1 percent experienced serious adverse events. The mortality rate seven days after treatment was 14.9 percent, but the researchers noted the infusion patients were already gravely ill and the rate "does not appear excessive."

  Two giant pandas in Canada will be heading back to China because their main meal, fresh bamboo, was getting too difficult to find, officials at Calgary Zoo said.
  The bamboo for Er Shun and Da Mao was flown directly from China and then, when the pandemic reduced flights, on transfers from Toronto, the zoo said Tuesday. But even those flights have been reduced, making the adult bears' favored food supply shaky.
  "We believe the best and safest place for Er Shun and Da Mao to be during these challenging and unprecedented times is where bamboo is abundant and easy to access," Calgary Zoo President and CEO Cl√©ment Lanthier said in a statement.

  Americans are moving again. Or, at least, they're looking for directions again.
  After two months of social distancing and staying home to curb the spread of the coronavirus, data from Apple suggests that people in several cities, most of them where reopening plans are in place, are starting to venture outside their homes again.
