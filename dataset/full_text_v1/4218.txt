  A trio of Hawaiian mayors asked President Donald Trump on Wednesday to halt nonessential out-of-state travel to the islands.
  In a letter to the president, Kirk Caldwell of Honolulu, Derek Kawakami of Kauai and Mike Victorino of Maui argued the move would slow the spread of coronavirus, which has caused  one death  in a state with 258 cases. Caldwell said a majority of those cases were "travel-related."
  "Now is not the time for leisurely travel," Kawakami said.
  On Tuesday, Gov. David Ige ordered those traveling between islands to self-quarantine for 14 days.
