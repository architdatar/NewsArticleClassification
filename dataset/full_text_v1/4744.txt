  Another coronavirus case has been diagnosed in Illinois, the state's fourth.
  The  Illinois Department of Public Heath  announced Monday the patient is a woman in her 70s, and is quarantined in her home. Her husband — also in his 70s — was previously diagnosed.
  Both patients are said to be doing well. Health officials are now reaching out to people who may have come into contact with the couple to prevent any further spread.
  Two other patients diagnosed in Illinois in January have since recovered.
