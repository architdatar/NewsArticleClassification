A new pandemic threat  could be simmering in China  while at home the nation's leading infectious disease expert warned that  new cases could reach 100,000 per day  if the trend isn't averted.
  "I think it is important to tell you and the American public that I'm very concerned because it could get very bad," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ,  told a Senate committee Tuesday.
  More states  are tightening restrictions  aimed at tamping down the alarming boom in coronavirus cases. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut  doubled the number of states on its quarantine list , to 16. Arizona  delayed the start for in-class learning  for the 2020-21 school year. Oregon and Kansas are the latest states that will begin to require face masks in public.
  In China, researchers are concerned about a new swine flu strain in pigs that could have "pandemic potential." Fauci, however, said the strain was not an immediate threat to Americans.
  Here are some major developments: 
  📈Today's stats:  The number of confirmed cases globally is nearly 10.4 million, and the death toll is more than 509,700. There are more than 2.6 million cases in the U.S. and over 127,300 deaths, according to the  Johns Hopkins University data dashboard .
  📰 What we're reading:  As coronavirus cases surge in Arizona and Gov. Doug Ducey orders bars, gyms and theaters to close again,  this town's mayor says he won't cancel events nor require masks . "My response from the onset of COVID-19 pandemic has been that we will err on the side of freedom," Eagar Mayor Bryce Hamblin said in a statement.

  The Senate  passed a surprise extension  for the Paycheck Protection Program to August 8 by unanimous consent Tuesday night, just hours before it was set to close down. 
  The legislation would extend the deadline for when the PPP can accept applications for forgivable loans. The bill gives the Small Business Administration the authority to continue approving loans to businesses that apply. 
  However, the House of Representatives will need to pass the legislation, and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature to keep the money flowing. Both chambers of Congress are set to adjourn for recess by the week’s conclusion.
  The massive loan program has helped keep millions of small businesses afloat during the coronavirus pandemic and already has disbursed more than $500 billion to roughly 4.8 million businesses, most of them mom-and-pop outfits such as nail salons and retail stores.

  California Gov. Gavin Newsom will announce new coronavirus restrictions Wednesday to "tighten things up" as cases surge in the state.
  "The framework for us is this: If you're not gonna stay home and you're not gonna wear masks in public, we have to enforce, and we will and we'll be making announcements on enforcement tomorrow," Newsom said at a news conference Tuesday.
  He said the state will be “a little bit more aggressive as it relates to guidelines on Fourth of July.” California has  nearly 223,000 infections  with close to 6,000 deaths reported. However, officials are concerned about the hospitalization rates, which increased by 43% in the last two weeks.
  Massachusetts reported zero COVID-19 deaths Tuesday for the first time in months, according to data in the state’s Department of Public Health's  daily release .
  The data also shows a downward trajectory in all four of the state’s public health indicators: the seven-day positive test rate, the three-day average of hospitalized patients, the number of hospitals at surge capacity, and the three-day average of deaths.
  Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said at a  press conference Tuesday  that the state does “not want to take one step forward and two steps back as we keep climbing out of this horrific pandemic.”
  Baker announced that the state will exempt travelers from Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, New York, and New Jersey from the state’s two week self-quarantine advisory. “COVID-19 will not be taking a summer vacation,” Baker said, referencing the Fourth of July weekend. Massachusetts has reported at least 8,054 fatalities from the pandemic – the first death on March 20.

  The Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that a coronavirus vaccine  would need to be at least 50% more effective  than a placebo in preventing or at least decreasing the severity of COVID-19 in order for them to approve it. 
  That threshold "would have been what I would have chosen since that is around what flu vaccines do that save lives," said Barry Bloom, an immunologist and professor of public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. "Greater would, of course, be ideal."
  With the FDA being under an Emergency Use Authorization rather than the typical process, some have expressed concern that the agency might face pressure from the White House to approve a COVID-19 vaccine as quickly as possible.
  The first vaccine to be approved must go through the full FDA licensure process, including Phase 3 clinical trials to show it protests people against disease or infection

  Savannah Mayor Van Johnson issued an emergency order Tuesday, mandating that face masks be worn in public spaces and inside commercial establishments within city limits.
  The rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases in Chatham County prompted the mandate, making Savannah the first major city in the state to mandate the wearing the masks. The order begins at 8 a.m. Wednesday until further notice.
  "Frankly, and honestly, I do not believe we have any other choice," Johnson said during his weekly briefing at City Hall while recapping the recent increase in COVID-19 cases across the county. "The numbers speak for themselves."

  Health experts are concerned a crowd of 7,500 gathering without social distancing and masks  at the Mount Rushmore fireworks display could cause a spike  in coronavirus cases following the event.
  The July 3 fireworks, which President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend, will be the first at Mount Rushmore National Monument in a decade. Health professionals in South Dakota are concerned the lack of mitigation efforts expected at the event could cause the coronavirus to spread in the communities surrounding Mount Rushmore and in communities where attendees live following the event.
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has four levels of coronavirus risk for events and the Mount Rushmore fireworks falls into the highest risk category: a large in-person gathering where it will be hard for attendees to remain 6 feet apart and attendees have traveled from outside the local area.

  As a infections rise in the South and West, GOP officials are  urging that masks are not about politics , as President Donald Trump suggests, and telling Americans they can help save lives by wearing them.
  Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, called upon Trump to start wearing a mask, at least some of the time, to set a good example.
  “Unfortunately, this simple, lifesaving practice has become part of a political debate that says: If you’re for Trump, you don’t wear a mask. If you’re against Trump, you do,” Alexander said.
  Earlier this month, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that some people wear masks simply to show that they disapprove of him.

  American Airlines came under fire at a Senate hearing  Tuesday for its decision to stop blocking seats in the name of social distancing beginning Wednesday.
  Health officials expressed frustration with the Dallas-based carrier's move, which was announced last week, when Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders asked why the government has not issued guidelines prohibiting social-distancing violations on flights.
  "It’s a critical area," CDC Director Robert Redfield told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. "When they announced that the other day, obviously there was substantial disappointment with American Airlines.”
  Redfield said the CDC was reviewing American Airlines' policy and added, "We don’t think it’s the right message."

  There is no guarantee that a safe and effective vaccine will soon be ready, but public health experts remain  "cautiously optimistic"  that doses will be available to the public early next year, Fauci told a Senate panel Tuesday.
  Fauci also acknowledged the nation was going in the "wrong direction," citing the recent surge in new COVID-19 cases. He said several states may have eased restrictions before meeting standards laid out for a safe reopening and warned that daily new cases could more than double, to 100,000.
  "We’ve really got to do something about that and we need to deal with it quickly," he said. "It could get very bad."
  Disruptions to health care and lack of food from COVID-19 are likely to  cost the lives of at least 250,000 babies and young children  and more than 10,000 mothers in low- and moderate-income countries over the next six months, according to a study from researchers at Johns Hopkins University.
  The study, published in  The Lancet Global Health , modeled how many extra deaths could be expected from COVID-19’s impact on the food supply and medical systems in these countries. The study found a dramatic increase in maternal deaths from the absence of childbirth interventions such as antibiotics and clean birth environments. Children will be more likely to die from lack of nutrition, reduced availability of antibiotics for pneumonia, sepsis and rehydration solution for diarrhea, according to the study.

  The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said he is concerned about the  "significant increases" in coronavirus cases  across the nation, which he attributed to increased testing, community transmission and individual outbreaks.
  Dr. Robert Redfield said hospitalizations are rising in 12 states and daily deaths are increasing in Arizona. He said from March to May when testing was still ramping up, health officials were probably detecting only one case in 10. Truer numbers are now being revealed, he said.
  The CDC was planning to release recommendations for reopening elementary, secondary and higher education schools as well as businesses, he said.
  "It's imperative that we take the personal responsibility to slow the transmission of COVID-19 and embrace the universal use of face coverings," Redfield told the Senate committee. "I'm addressing the younger members of our society, the millenials and the generation Zs. I ask those that are listening to spread the word."

  A swine flu virus found in Chinese pigs has the potential to jump to humans and even  spark a pandemic , researchers say.
  The Chinese and British scientists, writing in the journal  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , urge immediate measures to control the virus in pigs and to closely monitor workers who handle them. The predominant G4 EA H1N1 virus has acquired increased human infectivity, the researchers say, which greatly enhances the opportunity for virus adaptation in humans and "raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses."
  Martha Nelson, an evolutionary biologist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s Fogarty International Center, told  Science  magazine the likelihood of this variant causing a pandemic is low. Fauci, the top infectious-disease expert at the National Institutes of Health, told a Senate committee Tuesday that the virus was “not an immediate threat” but something to “keep your eye on.”
  New York, New Jersey and Connecticut added travelers from California, Tennessee and six other states to its quarantine list Tuesday morning, pushing the total to 16 states representing 48% of the U.S. population. Travelers from the affected states will now have to isolate for 14 days upon arriving in the three northeastern states, doubling the original list of eight states included in the joint travel advisory issued last week.
  "We've set metrics for community spread just as we've set metrics for everything the state does to fight COVID-19," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. "Eight more states have reached the level of spread required to qualify for New York's travel advisory."

  Americans  will not be allowed to travel to European Union countries  when the bloc opens up to international visitors July 1, the European Council announced Tuesday. 
  Travelers from 14 countries will be welcomed to the EU, including Canada, South Korea and Australia. But Americans and citizens of many other nations will be barred as too risky because of spiking coronavirus cases in their home countries. Chinese travelers will be allowed to visit if that country's government confirms a policy of reciprocity, the council's announcement said.
  The United States leads the world in the number of coronavirus cases with nearly 2.7 million infections as of June 30, according to Johns Hopkins data.

  If you think of a clock ticking from midnight (when the pandemic began around Jan. 1) to noon (when vaccines will be widely available in the United States), then a panel of experts assembled by USA TODAY says  it’s now about 4 a.m.  We are about one-third of the way there, the panel of 10 physicians and scientist estimates. That timeline gets us to the promised land of near normalcy sometime next spring. That's a bit less optimistic than Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has repeatedly said he hopes a vaccine could be available by the end of 2020 or early 2021.
  “I think we’ll have a vaccine by the middle of next year,” said panel member Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia.
