  More federal financial help is on the way for New York City's transit system, which has been reeling from losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  
  President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Thursday night that about $300 million was heading to New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority, part of the $3.9 billion that's been allocated for New York under coronavirus stimulus legislation passed by Congress.
  Another $298M heading to  @MTA , adding up to over $2B in federal funding from  @USDOT  so far, part of the $3.9B total from the CARES Act. This is critical to keeping essential personnel moving and aiding metro NYC in recovery. We are here for the people of New York!
  The MTA runs the state's trains, subways and buses. With the payment, the agency will have received over $2 billion in federal funding to date, Trump said. 
  "This is critical to keeping essential personnel moving and aiding metro NYC in recovery," the president tweeted. 
  Gov. Andrew  Cuomo told reporters last week  that the agency "desperately needs funding because the ridership is way down" and credited Trump for expediting the payments to his former home state. The "president cut red tape," Cuomo said.
