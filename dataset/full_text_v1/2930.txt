  The entire country is now under a major disaster declaration for the coronavirus pandemic.
  Wyoming on Saturday became the final state to receive such a declaration, which comes 22 days after the first one was approved, for New York, on March 20.
  In addition to the 50 states, disaster declarations are also in place for Washington, D.C., as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
  Only one U.S. territory isn't under a major disaster declaration — American Samoa.
