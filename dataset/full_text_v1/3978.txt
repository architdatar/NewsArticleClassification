  Some businesses in Italy are increasing coffee prices more than 50 percent and consumers are not happy, according to consumer rights’ association  Codacons , which said it received dozens of complaints since the shops began reopening in Italy on Monday. The association has also received complaints about spikes in hairdresser prices.
  As shops and restaurants open  after ten weeks in lockdown , coffee drinkers have reported cafes charging 2 euros (about $2.20) for an espresso in Milan — about 54 percent more than the city's pre-lockdown espresso-price of 1.30 euros. In the capital city of Rome — where a coffee used to cost 1.10 euros on average — coffee-drinkers were unhappy about now paying 1.50 euros.
  "We hope these are isolated situations, and that the exhibitors do not decide en masse to adjust the price lists to make up for the lower earnings and sanitation costs of the premises,” the association’s president, Carlo Rienzi, said in a statement on Monday.
