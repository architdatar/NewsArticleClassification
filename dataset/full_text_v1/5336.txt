  The same day it  announced its first case of COVID-19 , Philadelphia called off its St. Patrick’s Day Parade and all related events on Tuesday. 
  About the time that the Philadelphia St. Patrick's Day Observance Association  announced the parade cancellation , Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney urged people to avoid "any event with 5,000 or more attendees from now through Friday.” 
  Boston  canceled its annual parade  on Monday, and the Republic of Ireland  also canceled St. Patrick's Day festivities  this week, including the national St. Patrick's Festival parade in Dublin on March 17.
