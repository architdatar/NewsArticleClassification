  Voting will proceed as planned in four states holding primaries on Tuesday, election officials said in a joint statement Friday.
  While  Louisiana announced Friday  that it would postpone its April 4 primary due to  the coronavirus outbreak , election officials from Florida, Arizona, Ohio and Illinois said their March 17 primaries would proceed as planned — but with some extra precautions.
  The four secretaries of state said they  " are working closely with our state health officials to ensure that our poll workers and voters can be confident that voting is safe."
  "Further, guidance from voting machine manufacturers on how best to sanitize machines, guidance from CDC on best practices for hand washing, and guidance from our respective state health officials is being provided to every polling location," the statement said.
