  Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a meeting with epidemiologists Monday that his country has not yet reached the peak of coronavirus infections and deaths.
  "Therefore we must do everything to flatten this peak," Putin said. Russia has around 47,000 confirmed cases and more than 400 reported deaths.
  Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry has quarantined 15,000 troops after they took part in rehearsals for the country's now-postponed Victory Day celebrations, which had been scheduled to take place May 9.
  Video footage showed the thousands of soldiers in tight formation without masks or other protective equipment.Â All hardware used in the rehearsals will be sanitized before being returned to its bases, the ministry said.
