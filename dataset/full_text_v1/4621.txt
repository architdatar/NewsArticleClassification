  PARIS — France’s health minister has reported the country’s highest 24-hour death toll recorded in the country since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
  Olivier Veran said Monday evening that 833 people died of coronavirus in hospitals and nursing homes since Sunday.
  Though some predicted that the infection rate might start to slow, Veran said that “we have not reached the end of the ascent of this epidemic.”
  France has only recently started counting nursing home deaths in their COVID-19-related death counts, and previously only reported deaths in hospitals.
  The total number that have died from the coronavirus stands at 8,911.
