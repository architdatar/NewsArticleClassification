  "We went from the worst infection rate [in the nation] to the best infection rate," New York state Gov. Andrew Cuomo  told  ABC News' Amy Robach in an interview on Tuesday in Albany, New York, about the first 100 days of New York's response to COVID-19 -- which began with the state's first confirmed case on March 1 and ended on a small note of triumph on June 8, with the partial reopening of New York City.
  Below is a timeline of the New York state governor's first 100 days responding to the coronavirus crisis:

  March 16:  Governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, all Democrats,  formulate the same rules for closures , saying they were forced to act because of a lack of coordination from the federal government.
  "We need the federal government to do a better job," Cuomo said.  "States don't have the capacity or the power to make up for the federal government.  We're doing the best we can, but we need the federal government to step up." New York cases hit 950.

  April 1:  The Regional Emergency Medical Services Council of NYC issues chilling orders,  obtained by ABC News , to public and private EMS services in New York City and Long Island that have been stretched to the brink -- representing tacit acknowledgment that certain near-death patients will likely not be able to be saved while city hospitals are overrun with coronavirus infections.

That won't happen!"
  Just before 11 a.m., Trump characterized himself as the  captain of a mutinous ship .
  "Tell the Democrat Governors that 'Mutiny On The Bounty' was one of my all time favorite movies," he tweeted. "A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!"
  The president appeared to have mixed up the message of the 1935 Hollywood blockbuster -- based on an actual 1789 mutiny on the HMS Bounty -- in which the crew takes control of the ship and casts the sadistic tyrant Captain William Bligh adrift on the ocean in a tiny boat.
