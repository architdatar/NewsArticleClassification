  At least 70 people, including two staff members, at a San Francisco homeless shelter tested positive for coronavirus, Mayor London Breed announced Friday.
  The MSC South shelter is the largest in the city and serves 340 people. Capacity has been reduced to 100 residents, Breed tweeted. People who have not tested positive for the virus will be moved to hotel rooms while those with COVID-19 will remainÂ in quarantine at MSC South.
  "We've been preparing for situations like this and we're responding," Breed said in a separate tweet. "But it is critical that people continue following the Stay Home Order."
  From the beginning of this pandemic, one of our biggest concerns has been spread in congregate living situations. We've seen this happen in countless other places throughout the country. It is now happening at MSC South, one of our shelters here in San Francisco.
  Last week,  Gov. Gavin Newsom announced statewide plans  to house some of California's 151,000 people experiencing homelessness in hotels and motels through Project Roomkey. The goal is to secure 15,000 rooms for high-risk individuals living on the street.
