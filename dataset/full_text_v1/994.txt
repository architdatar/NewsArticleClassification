President Donald Trump recently told supporters that despite "some confusion," wearing a mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19 was the   What he didn't say was that he was the one fueling much of the confusion.
  The Trump administration's   about mask-wearing over the last four to five months has created widespread confusion, hampered the country's response to the coronavirus pandemic and even led to preventable deaths, multiple health experts said.
  In   and official statements, Trump and top members of his administration have voiced   on masks, ranging from   to  . Even as Trump in recent weeks has begun to urge Americans to cover their faces in public, he has wavered on whether to wear them himself.
  "People have died because we haven't had consistent messaging on mask-wearing," said Dr. Gregory Kirk, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. "I don't think that's really up to debate."
  Three experts who spoke to NBC News said early messaging politicized mask-wearing in ways that still linger. A   in late June found that 76 percent of Democratic-leaning voters say they wear masks in public, while just 53 percent of Republican-leaning voters said they do.
  The science and subsequent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the surgeon general have evolved since February, when masks weren't initially recommended for the general public. That was, in part, because of concerns about having enough personal protective equipment for medical workers caring for COVID-19 patients and also because the risk of asymptomatic transmission wasn't yet understood. But even as the country's top scientists began to urge everyone to wear masks in public,  .
  Experts say that to get the pandemic under control, the guidance must be much clearer.
  "For some people, it's hard for them to discern what is the right information and what is not," said Dr. May Chu, a clinical professor in the epidemiology department at the Colorado School of Public Health. "And there's no leadership in coordinating the message either, so different messages come out."
  Following is a timeline of the administration's evolving messaging:

Let me be very clear ‚Äî and I'm sure the physicians who are up here will reflect this as well: The average American does not need to go out and buy a mask." ‚Äî Vice President Mike Pence at a  .
