  Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she would like President Donald Trump to "step back" and appoint a public health official to be the spokesman for the federal government's response to the coronavirus outbreak. 
  “My suggestion would be Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been around for decades and is such a well-regarded infectious disease specialist," Collins told reporters in the state capital in remarks first reported by the Portland Press Herald on Friday. Collins' spokeswoman Annie Clark confirmed her remarks to NBC News on Monday.
  Collins said that the federal government is making progress in dealing with the outbreak but she "isn't satisfied with the response." 
  “I think that the messaging at the federal level has been inconsistent, and when you are dealing with a  novel virus like this, it’s very important that health professionals be out front and that there be a consistent message," she said, the newspaper reported.
