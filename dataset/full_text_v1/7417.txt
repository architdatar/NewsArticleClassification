  President Trump on Tuesday said Americans could use scarves as makeshift protective masks as the nation grapples with a shortage of protective gear amid the coronavirus outbreak. 
  "You know, you can use a scarf, a lot of people have scarves," Trump told reporters during a news conference at the White House. "My feeling is if people want to do it there is certainly no harm to it. I would say do it rather than going out to get a mask." 
  Personal protective equipment, or PPE, including surgical and N95 masks, are in short supply in the U.S., and  tensions have arisen between hospital systems and staff in many states  over a lack of proper PPE for medical workers.
  An  increasing number of  U.S. residents are choosing to cover their noses and mouths with makeshift masks, including bandannas, scarves or other wraps, when going into public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  guidelines indicate  that wearing a mask is unnecessary for healthy individuals, but the agency is now considering changing those recommendations.
