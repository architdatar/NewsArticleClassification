  One third of National Health Service staff and other key workers who’ve been tested for coronavirus have returned positive results, according to data released by the British government.
  According to the figures released Monday,  16,888  people who fall into the category of “key workers and their households” have been tested. So far,  5,733  – or 34% -- are confirmed to have the virus.
  The government has been under pressure to ramp up testing for NHS workers and their families, amid concerns about a lack of appropriate personal protective equipment. 
  Health minister Matt Hancock has previously said that NHS staff who show symptoms -- or live with someone who does -- will be able to get tested under the government’s plan, with the ultimate goal to provide testing to all NHS staff regardless of symptoms.
