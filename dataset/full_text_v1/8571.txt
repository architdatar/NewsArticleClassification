  Yale University said Wednesday that although it is eligible for $6.9 million in coronavirus relief funding passed by Congress, it will not seek the money.
  The money would come from the "higher education emergency relief fund" that was part of the CARES Act, which also provides direct payments to Americans and expanded unemployment benefits.
  Yale  said in a statement  that while it is "experiencing great budgetary pressure as a result of the pandemic," it hopes the government will use its share to support other colleges and universities in Connecticut that are having their existence threatened by the epidemic.
  "We wish to reassure Yale students that this decision will in no way diminish our financial support for them at this critical time," Yale said. 
  Harvard drew criticism from President Donald Trump this week regarding funding from the CARES Act. Harvard  said Wednesday  that it was allocated higher education emergency relief fund dollars it never sought or received and that it will now not accept the money.
  On Tuesday Harvard  in tweets  suggested it would accept that funding, pledging that all of it would be used "to provide direct assistance to students facing urgent financial needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
