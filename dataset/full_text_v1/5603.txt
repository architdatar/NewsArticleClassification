  Rep.  Ilhan Omar  is not a fan of the  coronavirus  press conferences at the White House. The freshman rep from Minnesota became the latest Democrat to criticize the briefing as rambling and self-promotional.
  MSNBC and CNN did not run the press conference in its entirety. Erik Wemple, the Washington Post's media critic, penned a column titled,  “CNN,  MSNBC refused to carry full Trump coronavirus briefing. Yay!”
  Omar took to Twitter on  Wednesday to call the press conference “disturbing to watch.”
  “It’s not only the lies and spins that are disturbing, but the millions of people who watch this and actually believe this insane stuff. It’s like watching a train wreck happen and not knowing what to do,” she tweeted.
