  Two passengers died from COVID-19 aboard the Coral Princess cruise ship, which arrived in Miami Saturday from South America.
  The ship was carrying 1,020 passengers and 878 crew members. At least 12 people tested positive for coronavirus. 
  "All of us at Princess Cruises are deeply saddened to report that two guests passed away on Coral Princess," the company said in a statement. "Our hearts go out to their family, friends, and all who are impacted by this loss. All of us at Princess Cruises offer our sincere condolences."
  Passengers who are "fit to fly" will be allowed to disembark starting Sunday, the company said. Those guests will be transferred directly from the ship to the Miami International Airport for flights home.
  Guests who require immediate medical attention will be prioritized, according to Princess cruises. Disembarkation of all guests could take several days.
